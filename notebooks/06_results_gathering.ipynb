However, the citation provided does not discuss or propose a hybrid approach for 3D pose estimation.\n",

      "\n",
      "The reference article examines the immune response to sporozoite immunization in mice, focusing on the CD8+ T-cell response to different Plasmodium antigens, including CSP and L3. The study investigates how homologous and heterologous immunization regimens affect the expansion and functionality of antigen-specific T cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CSP-specific CD8+ T-cell responses**: These responses are boosted by repeated sporozoite immunizations. CSP is an antigen present on the surface of sporozoites and liver-stage parasites.\n",
      "2. **L3-specific CD8+ T-cell responses**: These responses are not boosted by repeated sporozoite immunizations. L3 is a ribosomal protein expressed later in the liver stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The study suggests that the immune response to certain antigens, like CSP, can be enhanced through repeated exposures (e.g., sporozoite immunizations), while responses to other antigens, like L3, may not be similarly enhanced due to the nature of the immune response and antigen presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of the Statement's Validity\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the information from the reference article, it appears that the statement regarding limited boosting of L3-specific CD8+ T-cell responses after repeated sporozoite immunizations is supported. The article provides evidence that homologous sporozoite immunizations do not effectively boost L3-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, likely due to the elimination of infected cells and the consequent reduction in antigen presentation.\n",
