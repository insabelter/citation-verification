      "overlapped signals), it was difficult to extract the features of bearing fault information. In  [12] , a new current signature analysis-based fault detector for motors based on a matched subspace technique was proposed. However, it was only effective for detecting eccentricity faults, bearing faults, and broken rotor bars. Reference  [13]  proposed a technique based on vibration information to identify and classify different bearing failure conditions. -e setting and testing of parameters was strict and difficult; for example, the accelerometer needs to be very close to the motor, and the setting of accelerometer and data logger should be the same. However, this method needed much historical data with a complex computing process. In  [14] , an intelligent fault diagnosis of three-phase induction motors using a signal-based method was proposed and tested in different situations, in order to verify its availability in diagnosing failures, even when the operating mode data were limited. However, the experimental results showed that it was only suitable for the diagnosis of broken bars and bearing failure. -e aforementioned methods have their own advantages with the same disadvantages implying that they mainly focus on the diagnosis of a single fault, such as the rotor bar breaking or the stator short circuit. -us, they cannot effectively diagnose multiple faults, not achieving the requirement of performing an overall fault analysis of the whole machine. -erefore, how to improve the abovementioned fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis methods or put forward new ones is the main issue in the corresponding engineering domain for the motors. On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent analysis and diagnosis methods are gradually developed, such as expert systems (ESs)  [15] , artificial neural networks (ANNs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , Petri nets (PNs)  [21] [22] [23] , tissue P systems (TPSs)  [24] [25] [26] , and spiking neural P systems (SNPSs)  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Specifically, SNPS is a novel high-performance bioinspired distributed parallel computing model with powerful information processing ability. It is a special kind of neural-like P system  [29]  inspired by the topological structure of biological neural networks and the way that biological neurons store, transmit, and exchange messages, i.e., by sending electrical impulses (spikes)\n",

      "Abstract: The fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis of three-phase induction motors are of great importance for improving their working safety, reliability, and economy; however, it is difficult to succeed in solving these issues. This paper proposes a fault analysis method of motors based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis. To achieve this goal, fault fuzzy production rules of three-phase induction motors are first proposed. Then, the rMFRSNPS is presented to model the rules, which provides an intuitive way for modelling the motors. Moreover, to realize the parallel data computing and information reasoning in the fault prediction and diagnosis process, three reasoning algorithms for the rMFRSNPS are proposed: the pulse value reasoning algorithm, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm, and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm. Finally, some case studies are given, in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. \n",

      "overlapped signals), it was difficult to extract the features of bearing fault information. In  [12] , a new current signature analysis-based fault detector for motors based on a matched subspace technique was proposed. However, it was only effective for detecting eccentricity faults, bearing faults, and broken rotor bars. Reference  [13]  proposed a technique based on vibration information to identify and classify different bearing failure conditions. -e setting and testing of parameters was strict and difficult; for example, the accelerometer needs to be very close to the motor, and the setting of accelerometer and data logger should be the same. However, this method needed much historical data with a complex computing process. In  [14] , an intelligent fault diagnosis of three-phase induction motors using a signal-based method was proposed and tested in different situations, in order to verify its availability in diagnosing failures, even when the operating mode data were limited. However, the experimental results showed that it was only suitable for the diagnosis of broken bars and bearing failure. -e aforementioned methods have their own advantages with the same disadvantages implying that they mainly focus on the diagnosis of a single fault, such as the rotor bar breaking or the stator short circuit. -us, they cannot effectively diagnose multiple faults, not achieving the requirement of performing an overall fault analysis of the whole machine. -erefore, how to improve the abovementioned fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis methods or put forward new ones is the main issue in the corresponding engineering domain for the motors. On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent analysis and diagnosis methods are gradually developed, such as expert systems (ESs)  [15] , artificial neural networks (ANNs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , Petri nets (PNs)  [21] [22] [23] , tissue P systems (TPSs)  [24] [25] [26] , and spiking neural P systems (SNPSs)  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .
