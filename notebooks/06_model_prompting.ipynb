      "-us, they cannot effectively diagnose multiple faults, not achieving the requirement of performing an overall fault analysis of the whole machine. -erefore, how to improve the abovementioned fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis methods or put forward new ones is the main issue in the corresponding engineering domain for the motors. On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent analysis and diagnosis methods are gradually developed, such as expert systems (ESs)  [15] , artificial neural networks (ANNs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , Petri nets (PNs)  [21] [22] [23] , tissue P systems (TPSs)  [24] [25] [26] , and spiking neural P systems (SNPSs)  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Specifically, SNPS is a novel high-performance bioinspired distributed parallel computing model with powerful information processing ability.\n",

      "Abstract: Motivation: Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \n",

We compare the predictive quality of these approaches on the training and independent test datasets in Supplementary Tables  S7  and S8 , respectively. Results reveal that majority of these input types, except for the putative secondary structure, can be used to predict the cleavage sites reasonably well. The average AUCs computed over the 12 proteases equal 0.605 for the putative secondary structure, 0.766 for CKSAAP, 0.798 for the putative solvent accessibility, 0.806 for the PSSM and conservation scores, 0.922 when using the BLOSUM62 matrix-derived inputs and 0.947 when using the one-hot encoding from DeepCleave. Similar trend is true when using the average MCC, with the corresponding values equal 0.181, 0.463, 0.527, 0.510, 0.732 and 0.828.\n",

      "We summarize these results in Supplementary Tables  S4  and S5 . The results reveal that the DeepCleave models trained with transfer learning achieves a significantly better performance than the models trained without transfer learning for all 12 proteases. The average AUC of DeepCleave trained with transfer learning over the 12 proteases is 0.92, while the models trained without transfer learning achieve an average AUC of 0.75. In addition, DeepCleave trained with transfer learning also achieves a significantly better accuracy (0.89 versus 0.76), MCC (0.77 versus 0.52), sensitivity (0.88 versus 0.79) and precision (0.89 versus 0.76) than the models trained without the transfer learning. Taken together, these results indicate that the transfer learning strategy is effective for training accurate DeepCleave models using limited protease-specific cleavage data.\n",
