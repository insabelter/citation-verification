On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent analysis and diagnosis methods are gradually developed, such as expert systems (ESs)  [15] , artificial neural networks (ANNs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , Petri nets (PNs)  [21] [22] [23] , tissue P systems (TPSs)  [24] [25] [26] , and spiking neural P systems (SNPSs)  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

      "When the fault reasoning is finished, faulty sections are finally determined based on the fault confidence levels according to criterion rules. Because of the high requirement of fault diagnosis methods for processing fault information, the SNPS-based diagnosis methods have become a hot research topic with rich research results  [27-29, 33, 34] . However, up to now, the relevant research work is mainly focused on the fault diagnosis of power systems. Besides, the existing work mainly studies the postevent diagnosis problems. -erefore, to give full play to the excellent information processing ability and computing power of SNPSs, it is of great importance to expand their scope to different application fields, as well as extend the applications from the postante ones to new ex-ante analysis and prediction frameworks. -erefore, this paper moves forward in this widening of the scope of SNPSs. More specifically, the work proposes a fault analysis method based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for threephase induction motors.\n",

      "Title: DeepCleave: a deep learning predictor for caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrates and cleavage sites \n",
      "Abstract: Motivation: Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \n",

      "Moreover, we use grid search to adjust the DeepCleave hyperparameters. We utilize several strategies that are detailed below to prevent over-fitting into the training dataset. They include the use of ReLU activation function, L2 regularization, dropout  (Sainath et al., 2013)  and 'early stopping'  (Yao et al., 2007) . ReLU, which fixes the gradient disappearance problem in the backpropagation training algorithm, is defined as ReLU ¼ 0 if x < 0 x else : L2 regularization imposes large penalties on sparse spiked weight vectors, preferring uniform parameters. This results in the neural nodes taking advantage of a larger number of the inputs coming from the upper network layer, rather than only a part of the input. After the L2 term is added, the absolute value of the weights tends to overall decrease, especially if there is no particularly large value, that is, the network tends to learn relatively small weights. Dropout refers to the random removal of some neurons ('erasure' of these neurons from the network) when training a large neural network.\n",

      "edu/ . The calculations are done on the server side, freeing the user from utilizing their own hardware. The website of the webserver also provides access to the trained DeepCleave's models. The front page was implemented using PHP and the webserver runs using Tomcat7 on the Linux system. The underlying hardware is an eightcore CPU, 500 GB hard disk and 16 GB memory, which ensures that predictions are produced efficiently. To utilize the webserver, the users should paste the sequences of the proteins of interest into the 'TEXTAREA' or upload a protein sequence file that is formatted using the FASTA format. The website provides an example of correctly formatted inputs. The webserver allows for a batch submission of up to 100 sequences at a time, which is possible due to computational efficiency of the underlying predictive model. Users can download and run the trained models of DeepCleave using their own hardware to process larger protein sets. At the submission time, users can input an e-mail address to receive notification when the submitted task is completed. This email includes links to the web page with the predictions.\n",
