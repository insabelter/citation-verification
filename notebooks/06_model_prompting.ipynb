      "they cannot effectively diagnose multiple faults, not achieving the requirement of performing an overall fault analysis of the whole machine. -erefore, how to improve the abovementioned fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis methods or put forward new ones is the main issue in the corresponding engineering domain for the motors. On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent analysis and diagnosis methods are gradually developed, such as expert systems (ESs)  [15] , artificial neural networks (ANNs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , Petri nets (PNs)  [21] [22] [23] , tissue P systems (TPSs)  [24] [25] [26] , and spiking neural P systems (SNPSs)  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Specifically, SNPS is a novel high-performance bioinspired distributed parallel computing model with powerful information processing ability. It is a special kind of neural-like P system  [29]  inspired by the topological structure of biological neural networks and the way that biological neurons store, transmit, and exchange messages,\n",

      "As an important part of industrial and agricultural productions, the normal operation of three-phase induction motors plays a pivotal role in economic benefits and security risks. For a motor, any potential failure that cannot be predicted or detected in time may produce damage on it, resulting in downtime with potentially huge economic losses  [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition, when a motor has faults and is shut down, the first task is to perform abductive fault diagnosis to find its failure causes, which can effectively help the operation and maintenance personnels to locate faulty parts quickly. -erefore, fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis are of great significance for improving the working reliability and stability of motors  [5] . -e fault prediction of a motor is usually realized based on an online monitoring system to detect the early failure symptoms and trend parameters that can reflect hidden troubles. -en, these symptoms and parameters are processed by prediction algorithms to obtain early-warning information and integrated decision making  [6]  to prevent motor failures. For example,  [7]  diagnosed mechanical faults of motors by vibration analysis, which was carried out through a noncontact approach based on an optical computer mouse and a digital signal processing device. Reference  [8]  proposed\n",

      "finished, faulty sections are finally determined based on the fault confidence levels according to criterion rules. Because of the high requirement of fault diagnosis methods for processing fault information, the SNPS-based diagnosis methods have become a hot research topic with rich research results  [27-29, 33, 34] . However, up to now, the relevant research work is mainly focused on the fault diagnosis of power systems. Besides, the existing work mainly studies the postevent diagnosis problems. -erefore, to give full play to the excellent information processing ability and computing power of SNPSs, it is of great importance to expand their scope to different application fields, as well as extend the applications from the postante ones to new ex-ante analysis and prediction frameworks. -erefore, this paper moves forward in this widening of the scope of SNPSs. More specifically, the work proposes a fault analysis method based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for threephase induction motors. As an important part of this new method presented here, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm (FFPRA) and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm (BAFDRA) are proposed. -e main contributions of this paper\n",

      "Abstract: Motivation: Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \n",

      "a loss function to train our model. Moreover, we use grid search to adjust the DeepCleave hyperparameters. We utilize several strategies that are detailed below to prevent over-fitting into the training dataset. They include the use of ReLU activation function, L2 regularization, dropout  (Sainath et al., 2013)  and 'early stopping'  (Yao et al., 2007) . ReLU, which fixes the gradient disappearance problem in the backpropagation training algorithm, is defined as ReLU ¼ 0 if x < 0 x else : L2 regularization imposes large penalties on sparse spiked weight vectors, preferring uniform parameters. This results in the neural nodes taking advantage of a larger number of the inputs coming from the upper network layer, rather than only a part of the input. After the L2 term is added, the absolute value of the weights tends to overall decrease, especially if there is no particularly large value, that is, the network tends to learn relatively small weights. Dropout refers to the random removal of some neurons ('erasure' of these neurons from the network) when training a large neural network. Since randomly removed neurons are different in each batch of the training process, the corresponding networks are also different, resulting\n",

      "feature-based sequence encoding has resulted in the development of several well-performing predictors, it has a few shortcomings. First, the already large feature space must be enlarged by combination of existing features and manual design of additional features in order to further improve the prediction performance. The design of new and informative features is typically done via a trialand-error approach that requires a substantial amount of manual work. Second, the manually developed features could be irrelevant to this prediction and/or redundant (correlated), which negatively impacts the training of the accurate predictive models with the machine learning algorithms. Thus, inclusion of the new features usually involves application of feature selection techniques to reduce the risk of using irrelevant and redundant features. Third, the design of the new features and the use of feature selection methods have to be coupled with the selection of a suitable machine learning algorithm. To sum up, the design of these methods is rather complex and requires handing of three tasks: feature design, feature selection and algorithm selection. Deep learning-based approach to building the predictive models alleviates these issues. In contrast to the conventional feature-based methods, deep learning is a form of representation learning. That is, it automatically learns a suitable representation from the raw input data, such as protein sequences, without the need to design and select features.\n",

Similar trend is true when using the average MCC, with the corresponding values equal 0.181, 0.463, 0.527, 0.510, 0.732 and 0.828. These results demonstrate that the one-hot encoding utilized in DeepCleave provides the best solution for the prediction of the protease cleavage sites using this particular neural network topology, although several other types of inputs are also predictive. The deep network that uses all inputs secures relatively high average AUC ¼ 0.865 and average MCC ¼ 0.635. However, these results are still lower than the results secured by the one-hot encoding. Again, we believe that this stems from the architecture of the network that favours the binary inputs. One important advantage of the one-hot encoding is that it can be efficiently computed from the input protein sequence, particularly when compared to a computationally expensive calculation of some\n",
