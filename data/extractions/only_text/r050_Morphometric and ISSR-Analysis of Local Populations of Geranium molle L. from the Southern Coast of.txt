INTRODUCTION
Population genetics produce significance data on the levels of genetic variation, the partitioning of genetic variability intra and inter populations, inbreeding, gene flow, self-pollination versus outcrossing, effective population size and population bottleneck. Population genetics data can help us to choose effective management strategies for conservation of endangered and/or invasive species  [1, 2] . The genus Geranium L. comprises more than 400 species in different temperate habitats of the world  [3] . The generic delimitation and a complete description of the genus are provided by Aedo  [3] [4] [5] . Geranium is classified in 3 subgenera and 18 sections  [4] [5] [6] [7] . The genus has 23-25 species in Iran. These species are grouped in two subgenera and 8 sections  [8] [9] [10] . Diagnostic features in intrageneric level related to fruit discharge methods, mericarp margin and leaves shape. Geranium molle L. belongs to section Batrachioidea of the subgenus Robertium  [7, 11, 12] , which is distributed in Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia  [4, 5] . It is mainly found in northern parts of Iran at the southern coast of Caspian Sea. This species is a common weed of gardens, roadsides, pastures, disturbed sites and waste areas. It shows a great invasion in natural habitats, although generally seen as a potential environmental weed. G. molle is very similar to G. robertianum L., both species are in the subgenus Robertium that is characterized by the "carpel-projection" type of fruit discharge. G. molle differs from G. robertianum in having palmate leaves, bilobed petals, and smaller flowers  [13] . Dovefoot Geranium is an annual or perennial herb with a low rate of growth. It has multiple stems and basal leaves. Branched stems grow erect to 9-60 cm tall. The stems are reddish towards the base and densely covered with white hairs. The hairy leaf stalks are longer in basal leaves and shorter in the cauline leaves. The leaves are dull green with ciliate edges. Self-fertilized flowers occur from April to September. It can tolerate a wide range of soil types but requires dry to very dry and well drained soils  [14, 15] . There are no edible uses for G. molle. But it is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. It has minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and fibre. Molecular markers are useful in identifying the maximally diverse parental genotypes through an evaluation of genetic diversity which is useful in cultivar identification and breeding. Among the various molecular markers, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) are simple and quick techniques and have become popular as their application does not need any prior information about the target sequences in the genome, high-efficiency and sharp sensibility, and these techniques have now been widely used for line identification and genetic diversity. These markers have been used in DNA fingerprinting, conservation biology, identification and determination of species relationships in many plants  [16, 17] . G. molle grows in different regions of Iran and comprises many local geographical populations. Therefore, the present study was performed for the first time in the country to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of these local populations. The results of present study may have positive effect on conservation strategy and future breeding of this medicinally important plant. We used ISSR molecular markers in the present study as these markers were shown to be informative for genetic diversity and population structure studies  [18] [19] [20] .

MATERIALS AND METHODS


Plant Materials
For morphometric studies we used 132 plant specimens (5-12 samples from each populations), and for ISSR analysis, we used 109. Different references were used for the correct identification of species (G. molle),  [4, 8, 10, 21, 22] . Details of sampling sites are mentioned (Table  1 , Fig.  1 ). Voucher specimens are deposited in Herbarium of Shahid Beheshti University (HSBU).

Morphological Studies
In total 80 morphological (42 qualitative, 38 quantitative) characters were studied. 5-12 plants from each populations were randomly studied for morphological analyses (Table  2 ). 

DNA Extraction and ISSR Analyses
Fresh leaves were used randomly from 5-10 plants in each of the studied populations. These were dried by silica gel powder. CTAB activated charcoal protocol was used to extract genomic DNA  [20] . The quality of extracted DNA was examined by running on 0.8% agarose gel. 10 ISSR primers; (AGC) 5 GT, (CA) 7 GT, (AGC) 5 GG, UBC810, (CA) 7 AT, (GA) 9 C, UBC807, UBC811, (GA) 9 T and (GT) 7 CA commercialized by UBC (the University of British Columbia) were used. PCR reactions were carried in a 25 μl volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8; 50 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.2 mM of each dNTP (Bioron, Germany); 0.2 μM of a single primer; 20 ng genomic DNA and 3 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Bioron, Germany). The amplifications, reactions were performed in Techne thermocycler (Germany) with the following program: 5 min initial denaturation step 94°C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94°C; 1 min at 52-57°C and 2 min at 72°C. The reaction was completed by final extension step of 7-10 min at 72°C. The amplification products were observed by running on 1% agarose gel, followed by the ethidium bromide staining. The fragment size was estimated by using a 100 bp molecular size ladder (Fermentas, Germany).

DATA ANALYSES


Morphological Studies
Morphological characters were first standardized (Mean = 0, Variance = 1) and used to establish Euclidean distance among pairs of taxa  [23] . For grouping of the plant specimens, the UPGMA (Unweighted paired group using average) and Ward (Minimum spherical characters) as well as ordination methods of MDS (Multidimensional scaling) and PCoA (Principal coordinate analysis) were used  [23] . ANOVA (Analysis of variance) were performed to show morphological difference among the populations while, PCA (Principal components analysis) biplot was used to identify the most variable morphological characters among the studied populations  [23] . PAST version 2.17  [24]  was used for multivariate statistical analyses of morphological data.

Molecular Analyses
ISSR bands obtained were coded as binary characters (presence = 1, absence = 0) and used for genetic diversity analysis. Parameter like Nei's gene diversity (H), Shannon information index (I), number of effective alleles, and percentage of polymorphism were determined  [25, 26] . Nei's genetic distance among populations was used for Neighbor Joining (NJ) clustering and Neighbor-Net networking  [26, 27] . The Mantel test was performe as implemented in PAST ver. 2.17  [23, 24] . For this, Nei genetic distance was determined for ISSR data, while Geographic distance of PAST was determined for geographical data. It is calculated based on the sum of the paired differences among both longitude as well as latitude coordinates of the studied populations. AMOVA (Analysis of molecular variance) test (with 1000 permutations) as implemented in GenAlex 6.4  [28]  and Nei,s Gst analysis as implemented in Geno-Dive ver.2 (2013)  [29]  were used to show genetic difference of the populations. Moreover, populations, genetic differentiation was studied by G'ST est = standardized measure of genetic differentiation  [30]  and D_est = Jost measure of differentiation  [31] . The genetic structure of populations was studied by Bayesian based model STRUCTURE analysis  [32]  and maximum likelihood-based method of K-Means clustering of GenoDive ver. 2. (2013). For STRUCTURE analysis, data were scored as dominant markers  [33] . The Evanno test was performed on STRUCTURE result to determine proper number of K by using delta K value  [34] . In K-Means clustering, two summary statistics, pseudo-F, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), provide the best fit for k  [35] . 

RESULTS


Morphometry
In present study 132 plant samples were collected from 18 geographical populations. ANOVA test revealed significant difference in quantitative morphological characters among the studied populations (P < 0.05). Clustering and PCoA plot of G. molle populations based on morphological characters produced similar results therefore only UPGMA is presented and discussed (Fig.  2 ). In general, two major clusters were formed in UPGMA tree 1-13, 16 populations showed morphological similarity and were placed in the first major cluster. The population no. 15 has subdivision on two subclusters, but one of subclusters showed higher degree of morphological similarity with population no. 14 and formed the second major cluster. The result showed morphological difference/ divergence among most of the studied populations. This morphological difference was due to quantitative characters only. For example, population no. 16 has the shortest stem and basal-leaf length (1 cm), the shortest basal-leaf width (1.5 cm), the narrowest petal and calyx length (3.5 mm), among the studied populations. Similarly, population no. 3 had the longest stem-leaf length (2 cm), the broadest basal-leaf width (4 cm) and the longest petal length (6.3 mm), besides character as (petiole length of Basal leaves), separate population no. 7 form the other, while pedicel length separate population no. 6 from the other populations.

Populations' Genetic Diversity
Genetic diversity parameters determined in 18 geographical populations of G. molle are presented in Table  3 . The highest value of percentage polymor-  

Population Genetic Differentiation
AMOVA (PhiPT = 0.59, P = 0.010) revealed significant difference among the studied populations. It also revealed that, 40% of total genetic variability was due to within population diversity and 60% was due to among population genetic differentiation (Table  4 , Fig.  3 ). Pairwise AMOVA produced significant difference among the studied populations. Moreover, we got high values for Hedrick standardized fixation index after 999 permutation (G'st = 0.373, P = 0.001) and Jost, differentiation index (D-est = 0.435, P = 0.001). These results indicate that the geographical populations of G. molle are genetically differentiated from each other. Non-metric MDS plots of ISSR data (Fig.  4 ) showed both intra-and inter-population genetic diversity. The plots showed higher within population genetic diversity in the population no. 15 (East Azerbaijan kaleybar), supporting genetic diversity parameters obtained (Table  3 ). Genetic divergence and separation of populations 1-3, 5, 11, 8 as well as 15 and 16 from the other populations is evident in MDS plot of ISSR data after 900 permutations (Fig.  4 ). The other populations as population nos. 12 and 13, show some genetic similarity and overlapping as well as populations nos. 17 and 18, the overlapping occurs to a lesser extent for populations nos. 9 and 10, populations nos. 6 and 14, pop. nos. 4 and 7. Mantel test after 5000 permutations produced significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance in these populations (r = 0.41, P = 0.0002). Therefore, the populations that are geographically more distant have less amount of gene flow, and we have isolation by distance (IBD) in G. molle.

Population's Grouping Based on Genetic Data
The pairwise comparisons of "Nei genetic identity" among the studied populations G. molle (Table  5 ) 

Populations Genetic Similarity
Grouping of the studied populations by NJ tree is presented in Fig.  5 . In general three major clusters were formed. Populations of Golestan, Ramian and East Azerbaijan kaleybar populations (pop. nos.  [14] [15] [16]  formed the first major cluster and showed higher degree of genetic similarity, supporting our morphological result presented before (Fig.  2 ). The second major cluster contained two sub-clusters, plants of populations nos. 9 and 10 comprised the first subcluster both from Mazandaran, second sub-cluster was formed by populations nos. 1, 2 and 5, 6. The other populations comprised the third major cluster and were distributed into two subclusters. Populations nos. 7, 8 and 4 which comprised the first sub-cluster, while populations nos. 11-13 and 17, 18, 3 comprised the second sub-cluster. Among-population differentiation in phenotypic traits and allelic variation is expected to occur as a consequence of isolation, drift, founder effects and local selection  [36] . We have almost complete separation of the studied population in the network, supporting AMOVA result. The populations nos. 1-6 and 11, 16 are distinct and stand separate from the other populations with great distance. The populations nos. 7 and 8, as well as populations 12, 13 and 17, 18 show closer genetic similarity and are placed close to each other. Also, the other populations as population nos. 9, 10 and 14, 15 show some genetic similarity (Fig.  6 ).

Populations Genetic Structure
The Evanno test produced delta k = 14 as the best number of genetic groups. A STRUCTURE plot based on k = 14 in presented in Fig.  7 . The STRUC-TURE plot has revealed the allele combination difference among the studied populations and the occurrence of genetic admixture among them. This genetic grouping is in agreement with Neighbor Net diagram (Fig.  6 ), presented before. Therefore, 14 gene pools are identified for Geranium molle in the country. Although the studied populations contained some specific alleles for example populations nos. 1-6 and 11, 16 (differently colored segments in Fig.  7 ), they shared some similar alleles too. For example, it 3. AMOVA test of G. molle populations based on ISSR data. Within Pops 40% Among Pops 60% Percentages of Molecular Variance Fig. 4. MDS plot of G. molle populations based on ISSR data.

The plants of population no. 9 had some similar alleles for population no. 10: population no. 14 had some similar alleles for population 15. Moreover, mean Nm value of 0.23 was obtained for the studied populations that showed low value of gene flow, supporting STRUCTURE plot result. However, reticulogram obtained based on the least square method (Fig.  8 ), revealed some amount of shared alleles among populations nos.  16 and 17, 18  and between nos. 9, 10 and 11 also between no. 15 and 7, 8 and between nos. 1 and 5, 6. This result is in agreement with grouping we obtained with Neighbor-Net, as these populations were placed close to each other. As evidenced by STRUCTURE plot based on admixture model, these shared alleles comprise very limited part of the genomes in these populations and all these results are in agreement in showing high degree of genetic stratification within G. molle populations. 0.1 0 A consensus tree was obtained for both ISSR and morphological trees (Fig.  9 ), to reveal the populations that are diverged based on both morphological and molecular features.

DISCUSSION
The distribution of plant species is determined by various factors, such as physiological limitations, ecological niche, and geological history  [38] . Plant populations in the center of their distribution generally sustain stable conditions in a desirable environment for the species, while location at the margin of their distribution are exposed to less suitable location for establishment and to greater competition with other species than at their distribution center  [39, 40] . Population genetic study provides valuable information about genetic structure of plants, the stratification versus gene flow among the species populations, genetic divergence of the populations, etc.  [20] . These information have different applications, and from pure understanding of biology of the species to conservation of endangered species, choosing of proper parents for hybridization and breeding and phylogeography and mechanism of invasion  [26] . Geranium molle mainly found in northern parts of Iran at the southern coast of Caspian Sea. The present study revealed interesting data about its genetic vari-ability, genetic stratification and morphological divergence in north part of Iran. The studied populations have a low level of genetic diversity (He = 0.026-0.190). The Genetic diversity is of fundamental importance in the continuity of a species as it is used to bring about the necessary adaptation to the cope with changes in the environment  [19, 20, 41] . Degree of genetic variability within a species is highly correlated with its reproductive mode, the higher degree of open pollination/cross breeding brings about higher level of genetic variability in the studied taxon  [26] . G. molle is mainly self-pollinating species  [37] , therefore, low level of genetic variability within populations in this species might be related to its selfing nature. The mean Nm = 0.23 was obtained for investigated ISSR loci, which indicates low amount of gene flow among the populations and supports genetic stratification as indicated by Neighbor-Net diagram and STRUCTURE analyses. Similarly, the lower level of genetic variability occurred in Geranium species with limited geographical distribution and probably more selfing capabilities. G. stepporum Davis and G. tuberosum L. had the lowest level of genetic polymorphism (2.15%). Each of these species have a confined geographical distribution in the country and occur only in one province and low genetic variability may also occur due to small size of the populations 10<, in G. mascatense had the lowest POP5 POP11 POP4 POP2 POP1 POP6 POP16 POP14, 15 POP7, 8 POP17, 18 POP12, 13 101 101 101 102 102 102 100 100 100 104 104 104 109 109 109 105 105 105 107 107 107 103 103 103 106 106 106 108 108 108 110 110 110 99 99 99 98 98 98 97 97 97 95 95 95 96 96 96 93 93 93 94 94 94 15 15 15 11 11 11 14 14 14 13 13 13 12 12 12 52 52 52 51 51 51 55 55 55 57 57 57 58 58 58 59 59 59 56 56 56 54 54 54 53 53 53 48 48 48 49 49 49 46 46 46 47 47 47 50 50 50 60 60 60 61 61 61 62 62 62 61 61 61 63 63 63 64 64 64 67 67 67 90 90 90 89 89 89 87 87 87 88 88 88 21 21 21 22 22 22 23 23 23 24 24 24 25 25 25 35 35 35 20 20 20 8 8 6 6 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 7 7 29 29 29 28 28 28 27 27 27 26 26 26 86 86 86 85 85 85 80 80 80 83 83 83 84 84 84 81 81 81 76 76 76 78 78 78 79 79 79 77 77 77 82 82 82 30 30 30 31 31 31 33 33 33 32 32 32 9 9 10 10 10 16 16 16 17 17 17 19 19 19 18 18 18 39, 40 39, 40 39, 40 36 36 36 37 37 37 38 38 38 34 34 34 42 42 42 43 43 43 44 44 44 41 41 41 45 45 45 91 91 91 92 92 92 66 66 66 65 65 65 68 68 68 69 69 69 74 74 74 75 75 75 70 70 70 71 71 71 73 73 73 72 72 72 POP3 POP9, 10 level of genetic polymorphism (2.15%) not only have small size of the populations 10<, but also is inbreeding due to annual with small flowers  [42] .

However, limited gene flow was not solely due to geographical distance among the species, but some of the species, which grew in adjacent areas with overlapping zones, did not form any hybrids or intermediate forms as evidenced by morphological and ISSR clusters obtained  [42] . Another well-known feature of self-pollinating species is high among-population genetic and morphological divergence. This happens due to limited amount of gene flow or its complete absence among geographical population in a single species  [26] . The present study also revealed significant morphological and genetic difference among G. molle populations, quite in agreement with the mentioned assumption. This is particularly supported by STRUCTURE plot that identified 14 separate genetic groups within this populations and by consensus tree of both morphological and genetic data. Different mechanisms like isolation, drift, founder effects and local selection may act to bring about among population differentiation and therefore, populations differ in phenotypic traits and allelic composition  [36] . The present population divergence may be under influence of isolation-by distance across the distribution range of the studied G. molle populations. The dispersal of these populations might be constrained by distance and gene flow is most likely to occur between neighboring populations. As a result, more closely situated populations tend to be more genetically similar to one another  [43] [44] [45] . The populations, divergence may be accompanied by local adaptation. When we use multilocus molecular markers (such as SSR, AFLP, RAPD, ISSR, etc.) for population genetic studies we understand that these are neutral molecular markers (they are not directly acting as adaptive genes), but they may be linked to a gene or a genetic region with adaptive value  [26] . Therefore, combination of genetic divergence, limited gene flow and local adaptation have played role in diversification of G. molle population in the country. An ecotype is a distinct set of genotypes (or populations) within a species, resulting from adaptation to local environmental conditions, but which are capable of inter breeding with other ecotypes of the same species  [46] . Ecotypes are populations adapted to local conditions, at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Creation of a ecotype is very important because this type of variation has adaptive value for each species and increases biodiversity in the ecosystems. Matching ecotypes to local conditions increases restoration success. A practical value of recognizing ecotypic variation in grasses is in identifying the most suitable ecotypes for conservation, restoration, renovation, landscaping, and bioremediation  [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Based on the above definition, some ecotypes were distinguished within the studied populations. For example some of these populations had distinct morphological traits and also genetic content, such as populations nos. 3, 5-7 and 12, 16 were genetically differentiated (Fig.  9 ). A consensus tree was obtained for both ISSR and morphological trees divergence of almost the most populations at molecular level as well as morphological characteristics (Fig.  9 ). Detailed comparison of the characteristics in these populations revealed noticeable morphometric differences described above for populations nos. 16, 3, 7, 5. But we should state that, the studied populations differed in quantitative morphological characters and we do not know how much of the morphological difference pop5 pop4 pop2 pop3 pop8 pop7 pop1 pop6 pop9 pop10 pop10 pop15 pop14 pop16 pop13 pop11 pop12 72 71 70 75 73 74 6766 69 65 68 61 6362 585756555251 49 4746 19 18 17 1610 9 8 7 6 50 48 45444342412120 5 4 3 2 1 64 15 60595453 11 23 22 8483 81 82 85 8887 90 89 91 78 79 7776 80 92 86 25 24 27 26 28 31 32 33 30 29 36 35 38 34 37 39 40 13 12 14 103 102 101 100 107 105 109 110 106 108 104 99 99 98 98 97 97 95 95 96 96 93 93 94 94 1 0 among the studied populations is genetically controlled; they may be under influence of environmental conditions. Therefore we do not attempt to suggest new taxonomic forms bellow the species level for this taxon and consider them as different ecotypes only.
