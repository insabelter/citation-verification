R-d S$ pdL2s21.';,.S L R-P'd-R PdL2 II I (L = phosphine ligand; S = phosphine ligand or solvent; X = halogen.) Kuns i -2 demonstrate that a catalysed coupling can occur in the reverse sense ialkyl iodide/arylmagnesium) to the Kumada work3. B-Elimination is of course not possible here and for a higher iodide (Runs 3 -5), elevated temperatures were necessary (iiun 4), but the oxidative addition did occur in moderate yield 153:) and most importantly, even at these temperatures, no hexadecene derived from B-elimination was observed. ihie have already snown7 that the transition state for the formation of diorganopalladium intermediates (3) is susceptible to sieric inhibition and <n accord with this, when the aryl Grignard reagent of Runs 3 -5 was replaced with a primary alkylmagnesium (Runs 6 -S), the yields improved to SC) -91 . The use of a Inore sterically demanding set-al&ylmagnesium (Run 9j or set-alkyl iodide (iiun 10) gave sligi;tly reduced coupling yields (63 and 69. respectively) and the secondary -seconaarg coupling igun 11) even more so (37 ,). In this latter case, the product could have arisen from homo -coupling of the Grignard 8 reagent , but in the absence of added iodide (Run 12), no dic.yclohexyl was produced. In a control experiment in the absence of catalyst igun 5), no coupling products were detectable and the iodide was recovered unchanged. The use of 5 mole of catalyst appears to be optim:, and the yield did not improve on increasing the catalyst concentration to 10 . Palladium reactions are frequently highly chernoselective' and in exemplification of this, the extension of the coupling reaction to functionalised alkanes is in hand.
