<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Genetic diversity investigations are critical for understanding how to conserve and manage plant resources in every setting. Six Rindera species are reported in Iran. No detailed Rindera genetic diversity was investigated using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) experiments. Six plants from Iran's seven provinces were gathered and studied for our scientific purposes. Seventy plant specimens have been gathered in total. Our objectives were as follows: 1) to determine genetic variability among Rindera species, and 2) is there a correlation between the genetic and geographical distance of the species? 3) Populations and taxon genetic structure we revealed that quantitative morphological features varied significantly across plant species. Rindera species were classified into two groups using the unweighted pair group approach with arithmetic mean and principal component analysis. The unbiased expected heterozygosity (UHe) of Rindera Regia was in the 0.18 range. Rindera lanata has important Shannon information (0.30). The lowest value was 0.22 for Rindera Regia. In R. cyclodonta and Rindera media, the observed number of alleles (Na) varied between 0.33 and 0.49. R. cyclodonta and Rindera bungei had Ne values between 1.034-1.17, indicating an effective number of alleles. Rindera has a comparatively low gene flow (Nm) (0.45). According to the Mantel test, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.33, p=0.0001) between genetic and geographical distances. We identified a substantial level of genetic variation, which demonstrates that the Rindera species can adapt to altering environments because genetic diversity is associated with species adaptability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant materials</head><p>Six Rindera species were gathered from various parts of Iran (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). These species have been studied via morphological and molecular methods. Seventy plant samples (5-25 per plant species) were examined for morphometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis method was limited to 70 examples. We focused on the following species Rindera albida (Wettst.) Kusn.; Rindera bungei (Boiss.) Gürke; Rindera lanata (Lam.) Bunge; Rindera cyclodonta Bunge; Rindera regia Kusn. and Rindera media (Turrill) Riedl.

We employed RAPD primers to amplify the DNA (Operon technology, Alameda, Canada). These primers belonged to OPA, OPB, OPC, OPD sets. We selected those primers (10), which showed clear bands and polymorphism (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). Overall, the polymerase chain reaction contained 25μl volume. This 25 volume had ten mM Tris-HCl buffer, 500 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 0.2 mM of each dNTP; 0.2 μM of a single primer; 20 ng genomic DNA and 3 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Bioron, Germany). We observed the following cycles and conditions for the amplification. Five minutes initial denaturation step was carried out at 94°C after this forty cycles of 1 minute at 94°C were observed. Then 1-minute cycle was at 52-57°C followed by two minutes at 72°C. In the end, the final extension step was performed for seven to ten minutes at 72°C. We confirmed the amplification steps while observing amplified products on a gel. Each band size was confirmed according to 100 base pair molecular ladder/standard (Fermentas, Germany).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses</head><p>We employed the Ward techniques and the Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphometry</head><p>ANOVA findings revealed significant variations in quantitative morphological features across plant species (P &lt;0.01). Principal component results explained 74% variation. The first component of PCA demonstrated 50% of the total variation. Nutlet morphology and traits such as calyx length calyx width positively correlated with corolla length corolla color (&gt;0.7). The second and third components explained floral characters such as faucal appendages, nutlet length, and stamens position. The principal component analysis (PCA) and unweighted pair group technique with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) plots revealed symmetrical findings (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Generally, plant specimens belonging to different species were separated due to differences in morphology. Morphological characters divided Rindera species into two groups, as evident in the UPGMA tree (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>The first group belonged to Rindera albida, Rindera bungei, and Rindera media. On the other hand, the second group consisted of two sub-groups. Rindera Regia formed the first subgroup. Rindera lanata and R. cyclodonta formed the second sub-group. These groups and subgroups were formed due to morphological differences among the individuals of Rindera. Our PCA results also confirmed the application of morphological characters in separating and clustering the species into separate groups (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Identical results were also reported in the UPGMA tree (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In Rindera albida and R. bungei nutlets are 8-14 mm, two-winged; outer wing 3 mm broad, margin undulate, inner 2 mm broad, incurved, margin cristate-dentate, glochids absent, while in R. lanata, R. cyclodonta nutlets are 15.8-23 mm, smooth, the wing with smooth or often undulate blue margin, without glochids. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species Identification and Genetic Diversity</head><p>The primers, i.e., OPC-04 and OPA-05, could amplify plant (Rindera) DNA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). One hundred and eleven polymorphic bands were generated and amplified. The amplified products varied in power from 100 to 3000 bp. We identified OPA-05's most polymorphic bands. OPD-03 had the lowest polymorphic bands. The average polymorphic bands ranged to 11.5 for each primer. The polymorphic information content (PIC) had values in the range of 0.27 (OPA-05) to 0.66 (OPB-02). Primers had 0.42 average polymorphic information content values. Marker index (MI) values were 2.88 (OPB-01) to 5.66 (OPD-05), with an average of 3.7 for each primer. Effective multiplex ratio (EMR) values are useful to distinguish genotypes. Our study reported 8.20 (OPD-11) to 11.88 (OPD-02) EMR values. EMR values averaged 8.5 per primer (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). The necessary genetic features calculated of six Rindera species are shown (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>).  The unbiased expected heterozygozygosity (UHe) of Rindera regia was in the 0.18 range. Rindera lanata showed a 0.33 UHe value heterozygosity had a mean value of 0.25 in overall Rindera species. Shannon's information was high (0.30) in Rindera lanata. Rindera regia showed the lowest value, 0.22. The mean values for Shannon information were 0.24. In R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>cyclodonta and Rindera media, the observed number of alleles (Na) varied between 0.33 and 0.49. For R. cyclodonta and Rindera bungei, the effective number of alleles (Ne) ranged between 1.034 and 1.17. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) test highlighted genetic differences among Rindera species (P = 0.001). According to AMOVA, 65% of genetic diversity exists across species. Relative less variation (35%) was reported within the species. Genetic similarity and dissimilarity assessed through Genetic statistics (GST) showed significant differences i.e., (0.123, P = 0.001) and D_est values (0.245, p = 0.001). The neighbor-joining tree also revealed some major groups (Figure not included). The neighbor-joining tree also repeated the same pattern as indicated in Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>. In the current work, molecular findings also coincided with the traditional taxonomical (morphology) approaches for Rindera species. In the Rindera species, gene flow (Nm) was relatively low (0.45). Genetic identity and phylogenetic distance in the Rindera members are mentioned (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). Rindera bungei and Rindera media were genetically closely related (0.96). R. cyclodonta and Rindera bungei were dissimilar due to low (0.79) genetic similarity. The mantel tests indicated a link between genetic and geographical distances (r = 0.33, p=0.0001). The Evanno test showed ΔK =6 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the genetic details of the Rindera species. According to STRUCTURE analysis, Rindera bungei and Rindera albida were closely related to common alleles (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The rest of the Rindera species are genetically differentiated due to different allelic structures (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The neighborjoining plot also showed the same result. Limited gene flow results were supported by K-Means and STRUCTURE analyses too. We were unable to detect significant gene flow among the Rindera species. This finding is consistent with the grouping produced by Neighbor-Net (Figure <ref type="figure">not included</ref>) since these populations were located close to each other. As indicated by the STRUCTURE plot relying on the admixture model, these common alleles form a relatively small portion of the genomes in these populations. These findings concur in demonstrating a significant degree of genetic stratification among Rindera groups. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>DISCUSSION The Rindera is a relatively complex taxonomic group, and several morphological characters make it difficult to identify and classify Rindera species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(AKCIN, 2008)</ref>. Given the complexity, exploring other methods could complement the traditional taxonomical approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(ERBANO et al., 2015)</ref>. Advent and molecular techniques have enabled plant taxonomists to utilize molecular protocols to study plant groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(ERBANO et al., 2015)</ref>. We examined genetic diversity in Rindera by morphological and molecular methods. We mainly used RAPD markers to investigate genetic diversity and genetic affinity in Rindera. Our clustering and ordination techniques showed similar patterns. Morphometry results clearly showed the utilization or significance of morphological characters in Rindera species. PCA plot results also confirmed the application of morphological characters to separate Rindera species. The present study also highlighted those morphological characters such as corolla color, nutlet shape, nutlet length, stamens position, nutlet margin, nutlet disc could delimit the Rindera group. The Rindera species highlighted morphological differences. We argue that such dissimilarity was due to differences in quantitative and qualitative traits.</p><p>In our study, morphology and micro-morphology of flower and nutlet characters in six taxa of Rindera species are given in detail for the first time. This research aimed to discover diagnostic characteristics that could be used to identify Rindera species in Iran. As stated, morphological characteristics are a valuable aid for species identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(AKCIN, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">AKCIN (2008)</ref>, fruits and seeds are useful characters in identifying Cynoglossum creticum, C. officinale, C. montanum, and C. glochidiatum. However, due to differences in the seed coat and fruit surface, these species were classified as having two tuberculate and granulate kinds and two subtypes of granulate-punctuate and granulatetuberculate. The reticulate seed coat type and its particular subtypes have been identified depending on the ornamentation of the seed coats <ref type="bibr">(AKÇIN, 2008)</ref>. Previous research has examined the micromorphology of seed and fruit in a variety of taxa and underlined their significance in plant taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(OLGUN and BEYAZOGH LU, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">COSZKUNCELEBI et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">KHALIK et al., 2008)</ref>. Present findings on morphological differences are in line with the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(COSZKUNCELEBI et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, KHALIK et al., 2008)</ref>. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values are useful to detect genetic diversity. The current study recorded average PIC values of 0.42. This value is sufficient to study genetic diversity in the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(KEMPF et al., 2016)</ref>. High genetic diversity among the Rindera population was reported in the present study. The previous scientific data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(KURATA et al., 2019)</ref> supports our current high diversity results. Genetic analysis conducted via analysis of molecular variance and STRUCTURE showed genetic differences among the species.</p><p>Interestingly, STRUCTURE results showed the presence of shared alleles in Rindera species. Shared alleles are related to self-pollination in Rindera <ref type="bibr">(WILLIAMS et al., 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bees, flies, and honeybees (LEFEBVRE et al., 2019)</ref> pollinate some Rindera members. Present findings revealed limited gene flow, and it is quite logical to report low gene flow. Similar low gene flow values were recorded using RAPD markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(FISCHER et al., 2000)</ref>. Other probable reasons for limited gene flow are geographical isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(FISCHER et al., 2000)</ref> among the Rindera species and population. Low or limited gene flow results were according to the Mantel test results. The Mantel test found that genetic and geographical distances were positively correlated. Therefore,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>it is concluded that distance isolation and limited genes determine the Rindera population's genetic structure. Molecular markers (RAPD) and morphometry analyses were used to investigate genetic variability and population structure in identifying Rindera species. All the species had distinct genetic differentiation. Present results highlighted isolation and limited gene flow are the main deterministic factors that shape the Rindera population. Furthermore, we observed considerable genetic variation, which indicates that the Rindera species can adapt to changes in the environment since genetic diversity is associated with species adaptability.</p><p>Received, October 27 th , 2020</p><p>Accepted September 10 th , 2021 </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ISPITIVANJE GENETIČKE VARIJABILNOSTI Rindera KORIŠĆENJEM RAPD MARKERA</head><p>Juan YIN * Koledž za šumarstvo, Xinyang Koledž za poljoprivredu i šumarstvo, Xinyang, Henan, 464000, Kina Izvod Istraživanja genetičke raznovrsnosti su kritična za razumevanje kako sačuvati i upravljati biljnim resursima u svakom okruženju. U Iranu je prijavljeno šest vrsta Rindera. Nije istražena detaljna genetska raznolikost Rindera korišćenjem eksperimenata nasumične amplifikovane polimorfne DNK (RAPD). Sakupljeno je i proučavano šest biljaka iz sedam iranskih provincija za naše naučne svrhe. Ukupno je prikupljeno sedamdeset biljnih primeraka. Naši ciljevi su bili sledeći: 1) da odredimo genetičku varijabilnost među vrstama Rindera, i 2) da li postoji korelacija između genetičke i geografske udaljenosti vrste? 3) Populacije i genetička struktura taksona otkrili su da su kvantitativne morfološke karakteristike značajno varirale među biljnim vrstama. Vrste Rindera su klasifikovane u dve grupe korišćenjem pristupa grupe neponderisanih parova sa aritmetičkom sredinom i analizom glavne komponente. Nepristrasna očekivana heterozigotnost (UHe) Rindera Regia bila je u opsegu od 0,18. Rindera lanata ima važne Šenonove informacije (0,30). Najniža vrednost je bila 0,22 za Rindera Regia. U podlozi R. ciclodonta i Rindera, posmatrani broj alela (Na) varirao je između 0,33 i 0,49. R. ciclodonta i Rindera bungei su imale Ne vrednosti između 1,034-1,17, što ukazuje na efektivni broj alela. Rindera ima relativno nizak protok gena (Nm) (0,45). Prema Mantel testu, postojala je značajna korelacija (r = 0,33, p=0,0001) između genetske i geografske udaljenosti. Identifikovali smo značajan nivo genetičke varijacije, što pokazuje da se vrsta Rindera može prilagoditi promenljivom okruženju, jer je genetska raznolikost povezana sa prilagodljivošću vrsta.
