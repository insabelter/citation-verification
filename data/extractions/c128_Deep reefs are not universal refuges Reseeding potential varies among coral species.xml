<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Deep coral reefs (that is, mesophotic coral ecosystems) can act as refuges against major disturbances affecting shallow reefs. It has been proposed that, through the provision of coral propagules, such deep refuges may aid in shallow reef recovery; however, this "reseeding" hypothesis remains largely untested. We conducted a genome-wide assessment of two scleractinian coral species with contrasting reproductive modes, to assess the potential for connectivity between mesophotic (40 m) and shallow (12 m) depths on an isolated reef system in the Western Atlantic (Bermuda). To overcome the pervasive issue of endosymbiont contamination associated with de novo sequencing of corals, we used a novel subtraction reference approach. We have demonstrated that strong depth-associated selection has led to genome-wide divergence in the brooding species Agaricia fragilis (with divergence by depth exceeding divergence by location). Despite introgression from shallow into deep populations, a lack of first-generation migrants indicates that effective connectivity over ecological time scales is extremely limited for this species and thus precludes reseeding of shallow reefs from deep refuges. In contrast, no genetic structuring between depths (or locations) was observed for the broadcasting species Stephanocoenia intersepta, indicating substantial potential for vertical connectivity. Our findings demonstrate that vertical connectivity within the same reef system can differ greatly between species and that the reseeding potential of deep reefs in Bermuda may apply to only a small number of scleractinian species. Overall, we argue that the "deep reef refuge hypothesis" holds for individual coral species during episodic disturbances but should not be assumed as a broader ecosystem-wide phenomenon.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Tropical coral reefs are in global decline, with many under immediate threat because of a rapidly changing climate and the accumulation of local stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Even in remote areas with strong legal protection, the increase in frequency and magnitude of large-scale bleaching and storm events has severely affected coral reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Coral reef persistence increasingly depends on local areas that can offer refuge against such disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> and provide propagules to recolonize affected areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Deeper sections of coral reefs (below depths of 30 to 40 m), also referred to as "mesophotic coral ecosystems," arguably represent potentially critical ecological refuges. Although certainly not immune to disturbance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, they are commonly buffered from major bleaching and storm events <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> and have a near-ubiquitous presence directly adjacent to the world's shallow coral reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Although their ability to escape disturbances has been relatively well documented, the hypothesis that deep reefs harbor reliable reproductive sources remains largely untested <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and this was recently highlighted as a key knowledge gap in a report by the United Nations Environment Programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>The "reseed" potential of mesophotic coral reefs firstly depends on the extent of species overlap with their shallow-water counterparts. Although greater depths often confer greater protection from disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, the community similarity between shallow and deep reefs also decreases with depth, as a reflection of changing environmental conditions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Given this trade-off, the "deep reef refuge" hypothesis (DRRH) pertains primarily to upper mesophotic depths (~30 to 60 m)-deep enough to escape disturbances but shallow enough to guarantee sufficient overlap in species composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Species overlap between shallow and upper mesophotic communities can be substantial, with an estimated 25 to 40% of Caribbean coral species and ~20 to 40% of Acropora species (on the Great Barrier Reef) representing depth-generalist species <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. However, initial assessments have demonstrated that depth-generalist coral species are not necessarily composed of a single panmictic population over depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The three coral species thus far assessed for shallow-mesophotic connectivity (which includes two brooding and one broadcasting species) exhibit ambiguous patterns across geographic regions, with genetic differentiation observed in certain locations but not others <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. This geographic variation has consequently hampered a more general assessment of the DRRH as the overall role of deep reefs in shallow reef recovery remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>.</p><p>To understand the reseed potential on an ecosystem-wide scale (that is, across many species), it is essential to identify the nature of barriers to vertical connectivity and how these barriers may vary across coral species with distinct life history traits. The relative roles of depth and location have remained difficult to disentangle in past assessments of vertical connectivity, often because of geographic separation of sampled shallow and mesophotic populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. Nonetheless, depth-associated selection could pose an important ecological barrier to vertical connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref> even in the absence of physical barriers (for instance, on those reef slopes where shallow and mesophotic communities are directly adjacent). Depth-associated selection does not necessarily restrict gene flow; however, in species with localized sperm and larval dispersal (such as in most brooding corals), localized dispersal could lead to assortative mating and therefore facilitate a divergence-with-gene-flow scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. Similarly, assortative mating could facilitate divergence in broadcasting species if depth-associated selection is accompanied by temporal reproductive isolation, either through pleiotropic effects or through depth-related differences in spawning cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. The role of such ecological barriers to vertical connectivity remains poorly understood, and the impact of depth-associated selection on vertical connectivity has remained largely obscured because genomic sampling has been restricted to mostly to microsatellite sequencing in presumably neutral parts of the genome [but see the work of Brazeau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>].</p><p>Reduced-representation approaches to genome sequencing [for example, restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq)] allow for sampling of both adaptive and neutral genetic variation across the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>. In combination with a replicated sampling design (sampling the same habitats across multiple locations in a region), such reduced-representation approaches have the potential to identify the nature of barriers (that is, ecological or physical) that might hamper cross-habitat connectivity. Nonetheless, uptake of such genotyping-bysequencing approaches in symbiotic marine invertebrates has been slow [but see related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>] largely due to the nonspecific nature of these methods (for example, targeting universal restriction site motifs) in light of pervasive contamination by the obligate endosymbionts. In reef-building corals, this contamination stems from the fact that they are associated with a complex consortium of eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, with the hosted Symbiodinium representing a significant proportion of the overall biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. Endosymbiont contamination might not necessarily affect inferred genetic patterns for the host; however, this can only be ascertained when comparing it against an aposymbiotic (that is, lacking symbionts) reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. Contamination is of particular concern when evaluating horizontal versus vertical connectivity, given the prevalence of geographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and bathymetric (41) zonation of associated Symbiodinium. Unfortunately, published genomes for scleractinian corals are still scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>, and obtaining aposymbiotic tissue remains relatively difficult.</p><p>In this study, we test the reseeding potential of deep reefs by sampling genome-wide variation in shallow and deep population pairs of two species with contrasting reproductive modes (Agaricia fragilis and Stephanocoenia intersepta). To overcome the contamination issue, we used a novel method that generated a subtraction reference genomic library of Symbiodinium symbionts (isolated from coral hosts using fluorescence-activated cell sorting). We focused on the reef system of Bermuda, where there is extensive upper mesophotic habitat adjacent to the shallow reef <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, and whose isolated geographic setting suggests the probability that Bermudan corals depend on local recruitment sources for recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45)</ref>. In addition, previous studies highlighted the potential importance of the DRRH for at least some coral species at this location, given the observed vertical connectivity for two other Bermuda corals (Montastraea cavernosa and Porites astreoides) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. Through sampling of replicate shallow and deep populations, we assess whether the vertical connectivity potential differs between the two species and how vertical connectivity might be affected by depthassociated selection. More broadly, we evaluate how these species-specific patterns affect the reseeding potential of deep reefs in Bermuda and discuss the wider implications and caveats in light of the DRRH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collections, skeletal morphology, and endosymbiont associations</head><p>Coral colonies from the brooding species A. fragilis and the broadcasting species S. intersepta were sampled from shallow (~12 m) and mesophotic depths (~40 m) at four different locations around Bermuda (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Phenotypic characterization of two skeletal properties (corallite density and diameter; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) showed similar skeletal values for A. fragilis specimens from all three eastern deep populations (PD, JD, and GD; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). In contrast, the two shallow populations and the western deep population had either a much lower corallite density (PS) or a larger diameter (GS and WD). For S. intersepta, samples from the western population (WD) were similar to those from the other deep populations (PD, JD, and GD), with, again, the shallow Princess Beach population (PS) exhibiting a much lower corallite density. Sequencing of the COX1 (mitochondrial) region of associated endosymbionts showed that A. fragilis and S. intersepta associated with distinct endosymbiont types. Further characterization of a short chloroplast minicircle locus indicated that A. fragilis associated with a single endosymbiont haplotype, while S. intersepta associated with two different Symbiodinium haplotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). However, the vast majority of S. intersepta colonies (94%) associated with a single Symbiodinium haplotype (sint_chl_a); a small proportion associated either with the alternative haplotype (sint_chl_b) or with a combination of both haplotypes (nucleotide positions ambiguous for the mutations separating the two genotypes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contaminant filtering, missing data, and clonality</head><p>Sequencing of nextRAD libraries resulted in an average of ~1.4 million reads for each individually bar-coded sample of the two focal species (n = 213; not including failed samples). Using alignment-based clustering, we recovered 12,145 nextRAD sequence loci (hereafter referred to as "RAD loci") for A. fragilis and 7591 for S. intersepta under initial PyRAD conditions. From the recovered RAD loci, 10% of the A. fragilis and 14% of the S. intersepta data sets were removed because they represented contaminants matching the Symbiodinium subtraction reference. Additional contaminants (~2% of RAD loci) matching non-cnidarian references (with a notable abundance of the proteobacteria Ralstonia sp.) were also removed before downstream filtering. After quality control and minimal representation filtering, we obtained 2568 biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1579 RAD loci for A. fragilis and 7547 biallelic SNPs from 2187 RAD loci for S. intersepta (excluding 108 multiallelic SNPs that were included in analyses that support multiallelic data). Missing data average after filtering was 15% of SNPs for A. fragilis and 19% of SNPs for S. intersepta (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Although no potential clonemates were identified for S. intersepta (maximum allelic similarity, 86%), four groups of potential clones were identified for A. fragilis (allelic similarities, 94 to 98%). These represented two triplets and two pairs and always occurred within the same population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In addition, a small recruit (&lt;1.5 cm) sampled directly adjacent to an A. fragilis colony collected from a depth of 67 m was found to represent a clonemate. A single representative of each group of potential clones was kept in the data set for population-level analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genome-wide patterns of differentiation and outlier analyses</head><p>Global mean F ST (fixation index, a measure of genetic differentiation between populations) varied nearly two orders of magnitude between A. fragilis (F ST = 0.06998) and S. intersepta (F ST = 0.00081), with many individual SNPs exhibiting high F ST values for A. fragilis (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). From the 175 SNPs initially identified as F ST outliers for A. fragilis in the overall Fdist analysis, 56 were also identified as outliers by BayeScan. From those, 25 SNPs located on 12 RAD loci were identified as potentially under depth-associated selection (outliers in at least two pairwise shallow-deep comparisons but never in within-depth pairwise comparisons). These depth-associated outliers exhibited very distinct genotype frequencies between shallow and deep populations, with a minor allele private to the deep populations (but not fixed) in nearly half of these (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). Depth-outlier SNPs on the same RAD locus exhibited (near-)identical patterns, and genotype frequencies are therefore given for a single representative SNP. Two of the depthoutlier RAD loci matched sections of the Acropora digitifera genome, encoding an uncharacterized protein and a phospholipase enzyme (D1-like) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Visual assessment of the remaining outlier SNPs (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) indicates that an additional ~13 SNPs each had a distinct allele occurring in high frequency at the Western Blue Cut population (WD). For S. intersepta, 138 outlier SNPs were identified in the Fdist analysis, 4 of which were also identified as outliers by BayeScan, but none were identified as potentially under depth-associated selection using the criterion of outliers in multiple pairwise shallow-deep comparisons (Fig. <ref type="figure">3, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>).</p><p>Genetic structuring in A. fragilis across depths and locations Genetic structure was identified for A. fragilis (G-statistic Monte Carlo test for all SNPs: G obs = 56,315, P &lt; 0.01) and supported by all approaches [Bayesian clustering, principal components analysis (PCA), and pairwise genetic distances between individuals; Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>], indicating clear genetic differentiation between shallow and deep populations of A. fragilis, as well as differentiation of a deep population on the northwestern side of the island. The existence of three distinct clusters was further supported using the MedMeaK and MedMedK estimators for STRUCTURE (that is, maximum of three clusters de-tected; table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). To explicitly test for divergence with depth, we categorized measures of differentiation into four groups of three pairwise population comparisons (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> and table <ref type="table">S3</ref>): within-shallow (GS-JS, JS-PS, and PS-GS), within-deep (GD-JD, JD-PD, and PD-GD), withindeep-west (WD-GD, WD-JD, and WD-PD), and between-depths (GS-GD, JS-JD, and PS-PD). A nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed the presence of an overall difference between groups [Kruskal-Wallis c²(3) = 499.43, P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 ], and individual nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests indicated that differentiation of the betweendepths group was significantly greater than that of the within-shallow and within-deep population groups (W = 20,749,000 and 21,537,000, P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 ). However, differentiation of the between-depths group was not significantly different from that between the western (WD) and the eastern (GD, JD, and PD) deep populations. No significant differences were observed between the level of differentiation of the within-shallow and that of the within-deep populations, apart from differentiation of the western deep population (W = 17,196,000, P &lt; 2.2 × 10 -16 ).</p><p>Genetic clustering for the "neutral" data set (in which any outliers identified by either Fdist or BayeScan were removed), as inferred by STRUCTURE, was very similar to the overall data set, indicating genome-wide differentiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref> and table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). When considering the 83 individuals from eastern populations separately, STRUCTURE identified 26 and 9 individuals with an ancestry assignment of &gt;0.98 to the shallow and deep cluster, respectively (K = 2). A total of 108 SNPs (in addition to the identified 25 depth-outlier SNPs) exhibited strong allelic differences (Δp ≥ 0.5) between these "purebred" groups. Plotting the genotypes of all individuals for these SNPs across the ancestry assignment gradient reveals introgression from shallow into deep individuals, which is also reflected in the overall ancestry assignments (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). In contrast, introgression from deep into shallow appears very limited (for example, only minor assignment of shallow individuals to the deep cluster). The genetic diversity (that is, expected heterozygosity) of deep populations is also consistently higher than that of shallow populations (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Despite the shallow-to-deep introgression, no migrants were observed, indicating limited migration over ecological time scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of genetic structuring in S. intersepta</head><p>No genetic structuring across populations was identified for S. intersepta (G-statistic Monte Carlo test for all SNPs: G obs = 107,590, P = 0.3). The lack of genetic structure was further confirmed by assessing pairwise genetic distances between individuals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), and the lack of clustering identified by PCA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>), DAPC, and STRUCTURE (maximum MedMeaK and MedMedK of one cluster; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">table S2</ref>). When running STRUCTURE for markers in the 90th to 100th percentile of overall F ST (that is, most divergent SNPs), clear structuring between all seven populations was observed (K = 7), but the same structuring could be achieved when shuffling population assignments, highlighting that this apparent recovery of population delineation is an artifact of a priori population assignment (fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). Genetic diversity (that is, expected heterozygosity) was slightly higher in shallow populations (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Despite the lack of genetic differentiation among locations and depths, the Bermuda population was highly differentiated from the two S. intersepta samples from Curaçao (which were included as an out-group; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The Curaçao individuals contained 52 additional SNPs that were fixed in the Bermuda population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Natural species densities and relative contribution to overall community structure</head><p>The species A. fragilis and S. intersepta are depth-generalists that were consistently encountered at both shallow (~12 m) and deep (~40 m) depths around Bermuda (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>). Two additional species were also found to be common at both sampling depths: M. cavernosa [focus of a previous vertical connectivity study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>] and Orbicella franksi. The population densities of these four depth-generalist species were highly variable across locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>), but for all species other than O. franksi, population densities were higher at depth (except for A. fragilis at Gurnet Rock). In terms of the overall species composition at the three locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>), the four depth-generalist species constitute 86, 87, and 88% of the community at 40 m versus 20, 16, and 16% at 12 m (19, 14, and 11% when only broadcasting species are considered).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The rapid decline of shallow-water coral communities has led to a growing interest in mesophotic coral ecosystems because of their potential to act as a refuge and aid in shallow reef recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>. Although the ability of deep reefs to escape disturbance events is relatively well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, their role as reproductive sources remains largely untested <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Our study demonstrates that vertical connectivity can vary greatly between species within a single reef system. Using replicated sampling of adjacent shallow and mesophotic populations and a reduced-representation genome sequencing approach (which accounts for endosymbiont contamination), we demonstrate that selection drives depth differentiation in the brooding species A. fragilis. In contrast, extensive gene flow and lack of differentiation characterize the broadcasting species S. intersepta. Overall, the reseed potential of deep reefs appears restricted to only a subset of depth-generalist coral species; although ecologically relevant to these individual species, deep-water coral reseeding should not be assumed to be a broader ecosystem-wide phenomenon.</p><p>The strong genome-wide differentiation between shallow and mesophotic populations of A. fragilis was linked to depth-associated selection for a select number of RAD loci (Fig. <ref type="figure">3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). A pattern of local-scale genetic differentiation is commonly observed among brooding species and is generally associated with the more localized dispersal of both sperm and larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. In the case of A. fragilis, geographic distance cannot account for the strong observed differentiation between shallow and deep eastern populations, because differentiation between depths within each of the three locations consistently exceeded that observed for the same depth between locations (average horizontal distances of ~1.5 km versus ~12 km, respectively). Outlier analyses identified strong depth-associated selection across a number of RAD loci (n = 12; 0.8% of those examined). In the presence of substantial gene flow, such divergent selection across opposing environments is expected to result in heterogeneous genomic divergence (or "genomic islands of divergence") <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>. Instead, for A. fragilis, the background levels of genetic differentiation were also observed to be high (with genetic structuring remaining after removing outliers), indicating that the depth-associated selection in A. fragilis has led to genome-wide "resistance" to shallowdeep gene flow.</p><p>Given the observed lack of shallow-deep migrants, immigrant inviability (that is, selection against migrants between locally adapted   populations) is likely an important contributor to this resistance to gene flow in A. fragilis, reducing the chances of between-ecotype mating encounters and leading to assortative mating <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. Despite this apparent gene flow barrier, we observed introgression between populations at shallow and mesophotic depths, which may be facilitated through ecologically rare events of migration and interbreeding that were detectable with our relatively small sample sizes. Alternatively, limited introgression could be facilitated by stepping-stone populations at intermediate depths (not sampled), effectively enabling "multigenerational vertical connectivity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Either way, the extent of vertical connectivity does not appear to be ecologically relevant. Introgression between populations of A. fragilis was asymmetrical (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), matching observations from two other studies reporting directional gene flow from shallow to deep populations in the broadcasting species M. cavernosa and the octocoral Eunicea flexuosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. In the case of E. flexuosa, higher gamete production in shallow water (due to greater abundances and average colony sizes) was offered as a likely explanation for the asymmetric introgression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. However, for A. fragilis, this explanation appears unlikely given that population densities at two of three locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>) appear lower at shallow depths. Instead, the lower population densities and the near-complete or complete fixation of the major allele in 8 of 12 outlier RAD loci at shallow depths (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) indicate that selection against immigrants may be stronger at shallow depths (and, conversely, may not be as strong for downslope migration). Differential selective pressures could be a contributor to the observed asymmetric introgression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and associated higher genetic diversity at mesophotic depths (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</p><p>The observed introgression and the lack of alternatively fixed polymorphisms in A. fragilis appear to reflect a population-level rather than a species-level divergence. This is further corroborated by the observation that shallow-deep differentiation (eastern locations) is comparable to that observed between the western and eastern deep populations (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). Although distance and/or seascape resistance (for example, in relation to prevailing currents) may have played a role in the differentiation of this Western Blue Cut (WD) location, several outlier loci were identified in association with this specific population, perhaps indicative of environment-based selection (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). The western population also exhibited a phenotypic skeletal signature distinct from the other deep locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Despite this study focusing on vertical connectivity, the identification of both neutral differentiation and outlier loci in association with this western location reiterates the broader role of environmentbased selection in cross-habitat connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>.</p><p>For the gonochoric broadcasting species S. intersepta, no genetic structuring was observed across depths and locations (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Strong genetic differentiation was only observed for the two out-group individuals from Curaçao (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), which is expected given their origin near the opposite end of the latitudinal distribution of this species. Eggs released by S. intersepta (as well as by M. cavernosa) have been observed to exhibit high rates of fertilization immediately upon release ( <ref type="formula">55</ref>), which appears to be facilitated by intratentacular fertilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>. Although this rapid fertilization may not directly affect larval dispersal, it would result in more localized cross-fertilization similar to that in species with a brooding reproductive mode. Assuming such localized spermcasting, the observation of a single panmictic population across the reef platform of Bermuda indicates considerable larval migration between both depths and locations. Similar genetic connectivity over depth has been inferred in Bermuda for the broadcasting species M. cavernosa (4 to 58 m depth) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. In contrast to the brooding species A. fragilis, no RAD loci were identified to be under depth-specific selection [although, of course, only a reduced proportion of the genome was queried <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>]. In combination, the observed panmixia, apparent morphological plasticity, and association with a single endosymbiont highlight the depthgeneralist nature of S. intersepta and the potential for deep populations of this species to act as a larval source for shallow reefs.</p><p>The subtraction method allowed us to successfully apply a de novo reduced-representation genome sequencing approach (in this case, nextRAD) on endosymbiont-contaminated samples. Despite our attempt to reduce the endosymbiont contamination through multiple steps of centrifugation before DNA extraction, we still found 10 to 14% of RAD loci to be of Symbiodinium origin, highlighting the necessity of further steps to identify and remove such contamination. Only a small fraction of these sequences could be identified solely by comparison with Symbiodinium reference genomes, which is not unsurprising given their potential level of divergence (particularly in the case of the Symbiodinium minutum "B1" genome). This indicates that comparison with unrelated reference genomes alone is not a viable approach to eliminating endosymbiont contamination. Thus, although genotyping-by-sequencing approaches have demonstrated their de novo potential in nonmodel organisms, population genomic assessments of endosymbiotic marine invertebrates still require either an aposymbiotic host reference [by sequencing aposymbiotic sperm or larvae; for example, see related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>] or an endosymbiont subtraction reference (as in this study). Because obtaining aposymbiotic tissue can be difficult, particularly in brooding species, our subtraction method based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting provides an easy and cost-effective solution to this pervasive issue. Overall, we demonstrate that coral species with similar ecological distributions can exhibit very distinct potentials for vertical connectivity at a single location. Geographic congruence in patterns of vertical connectivity in M. cavernosa and P. astreoides (despite their opposing reproductive modes) highlighted the importance of location-specific extrinsic factors in determining vertical connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Our study focused on a single geographic region to specifically evaluate the role of depth, controlling for location-specific effects (by sampling replicate pairs of proximate shallow and mesophotic populations) and sampling genetic variation across the genome. The observed pattern for A. fragilis demonstrates how depth-associated selection can hamper vertical connectivity in the absence of physical dispersal barriers and corroborates the emerging notion that divergence by depth is prevalent in species with a brooding reproductive mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58)</ref>. In contrast, we found that the broadcasting species S. intersepta formed a single panmictic population across the same depths and locations. Nonetheless, divergence by depth has been observed in both brooding and broadcasting species <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, and the hypothesis that vertical connectivity is more prevalent in broadcasters than in brooders ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) cannot be evaluated until more species and locations are assessed. Regardless, these results demonstrate that the reseeding potential of deep reefs only applies to a subset of depth-generalist species.</p><p>Of the ~20 zooxanthellate scleractinian coral species described for Bermuda (59), 6 species appear to be depth-generalists occurring at both shallow and mesophotic depths <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60)</ref>. Among these species, A. fragilis, Madracis decactis, and Scolymia cubensis are brooders, while S. intersepta, M. cavernosa, and O. franksi are broadcasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. Although one of the brooders, A. fragilis, occurs in reasonable abundance at both shallow and mesophotic depths, our study showed little evidence for vertical connectivity between shallow and deeperwater populations. On the basis of their reproductive mode, such vertical connectivity may be similarly hampered for M. decactis and S. cubensis. Regardless, S. cubensis was rare at both depths, and M. decactis was only common at intermediate and mesophotic depths along the southern shore (and therefore not individually reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>), further indicating a limited importance of these species in a reseeding context. Similarly, P. astreoides (for which vertical connectivity was observed across 4 to 26 m depth) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> was relatively rare at mesophotic depths (~40 m). In contrast, all three broadcasting species occurred in reasonable abundance at both shallow (12 m) and upper mesophotic (40 m) depths (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>), and mesophotic populations of these species may represent a viable source of recruitment for the shallow reefs in this isolated reef system (although O. franksi has not been assessed). Nonetheless, although these three species constitute a considerable proportion of the diversity and composition of the upper mesophotic reef, they only represent a relatively small fraction of the diversity (~15% of species) and community (~15% of coral colonies) in shallow water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>).</p><p>The DRRH postulates that deep reefs (i) are protected or dampened from disturbances that affect shallow reefs and (ii) can provide a reproductive source after disturbance [sensu Bongaerts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>]. Although deep reefs can escape certain disturbances, they are not entirely immune to disturbance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>. In fact, even their ability to escape bleaching and storm events can vary spatially and temporally, and their greater depth does not confer long-term protection against disturbances associated with climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Similarly, disturbance events can vary strongly in their impact over depth and in their impact on specific species, which can vary in thermal susceptibility or structural fragility. Thus rather than the term "refugia" (as currently used in "deep reef refugia hypothesis"), which Keppel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref> classify as large geographic areas offering an escape over evolutionary time scales (for example, climate change refugia), we propose that the term "refuge(s)" is probably more appropriate (that is, "deep reef refuge hypothesis"), reflecting the role of deep reefs in providing temporal and/or spatial protection from disturbances on ecological time scales. In addition, this study confirms that the active reseeding potential is specific to only a subset of species (~15% here) and does not apply to a significant proportion of the species (diversity) that make up shallow reefs. Therefore, we conclude that the "deep reef refuge hypothesis" should be considered as an ecological concept relevant to individual species, rather than being referred to as an ecosystem-wide phenomenon.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study locations, specimen collections, and skeletal morphometrics</head><p>We focused on the isolated Bermuda platform in the Western Atlantic, where we targeted shallow (12 ± 2 m) and deep (40 ± 2 m) habitats at four different reef locations: Gurnet Rock, John Smith's Bay, and Princess Beach on the southeastern side and Western Blue Cut on the northwestern side of the island (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Specimens (n ≈ 30 per depth at each location) of A. fragilis (n = 208) and S. intersepta (n = 209) were collected under collection permit no. 130901b from the Department of Environmental Protection of the Bermuda Government, as part of the "XL Catlin Seaview Survey" in September 2013. Two additional samples of S. intersepta from Curaçao were included for use as a comparative out-group. Small fragments of the collected specimens were stored in salt-saturated buffer solution containing 20% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.5 M EDTA, and for a subset of specimens, a skeletal voucher was bleached, rinsed in freshwater, and dried. For these skeletal vouchers (A. fragilis, n = 49; S. intersepta, n = 37), corallite diameter and density were assessed across five pseudoreplicates per specimen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Separation of host fractions and DNA extraction</head><p>To counter the issue of pervasive endosymbiont contamination, we separated the tissue from the skeleton and performed multiple centrifugation steps separating out the supernatant to eliminate intact Symbiodinium cells. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a modified version of the "Wayne's method" (for details, see electronic notebook). Quality and yield of gDNA were assessed using gel electrophoresis and a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) to select a subset of high-quality samples (n ≈ 16 per species per depth at each location) for downstream sequencing (A. fragilis, n = 110; S. intersepta, n = 113; Symbiodinium, n = 15). Selected samples were normalized (gDNA quantity) and purified using AMPure XP beads to remove potential inhibitors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation of Symbiodinium</head><p>Given that a certain degree of endosymbiont contamination remained in the "host" samples [confirmed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with Symbiodinium-specific primers, likely due to lysed cells], we isolated individual Symbiodinium cells from the original pellet (which was, in turn, contaminated with a certain extent of host cells) to be sequenced separately as a subtraction reference. Symbiodinium isolation was carried out for aliquots of a shallow and deep specimen from each of the two species using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACSAria cell sorter) at the Queensland Brain Institute, separating out ~300,000 individual cells based on their distinct fluorescence signature (for details, see electronic notebook). In addition, Symbiodinium cells from several other coral host species were isolated from samples intended for other species-specific studies. Extractions of gDNA for the isolates were carried out as for the host.</p><p>Library preparation, sequencing, and clustering Library preparation was carried out using the nextRAD method (Nexterafragmented, reductively amplified DNA; SNPsaurus LLC), which uses a selective primer sequence (rather than restriction enzymes) to genotype loci consistently between samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref>. gDNA was fragmented and ligated with adapter sequences using Nextera reagent (Illumina Inc). Fragmented DNA was then PCR-amplified (73°C for 26 cycles) with one of the primers matching the adapter and extending into the gDNA using a 9-base pair (bp) selective sequence ("GTGTAGAGG"). Libraries were sequenced on three HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc) lanes using 100-bp single-end chemistry and following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Quality control, clustering, and SNP variant calling were carried out using PyRAD v3.0.6 (64) to allow for indel variation (common in marine invertebrates). After initial runs at different thresholds, we separately analyzed both species using a clustering threshold of 90%, a minimum coverage of 6, a maximum of three sites with a PHRED quality below 20, and a minimum of 10 samples in a final locus. Sequence data from the isolated Symbiodinium were filtered using PyRAD, allowing for a maximum of five sites with a PHRED quality below 20 (step 1), and reads were then clustered within samples using an 85% clustering threshold (step 3). Clusters with a coverage of ≥2 (to eliminate singletons) were reduced to a single representative sequence and used to compile a BLASTN database (n = 697,146 sequences). Parsing and analyses were carried out using custom Python (v3.4.5) scripts (available through <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/pimbongaerts/radseq">https://github.com/pimbongaerts/ radseq</ref>), unless otherwise indicated, with statistical analyses and plotting performed in R (v3.3.1) (electronic notebook available through <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/pimbongaerts/bermuda-rad">https:// github.com/pimbongaerts/bermuda-rad</ref>).</p><p>Identification of coral host loci and QC One representative sequence was extracted for each coral RAD locus, which was then BLASTN-searched against our Symbiodinium RAD database, and two culture-based Symbiodinium genomes [Symbiodinium B1 from Shoguchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref> and Symbiodinium C1 from Chan et al., draft genome], with positive matches (maximum E-value of 10 -15 ) removed from the coral RAD data set. An additional BLASTN comparison was carried out against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant nucleotide database (with the particular aim of removing any microbial contamination, if applicable), with taxonomic IDs of positive matches (maximum E-value of 10 -4 ) extracted and classified to phylum using the NCBI Taxonomy database. RAD loci matching to non-cnidarian taxa were subsequently removed. Given an overrepresentation of SNPs toward the end of reads, RAD loci were then truncated to 75 and 80 bp for A. fragilis and S. intersepta, respectively. SNPs representing singletons/doubletons were removed (rather than filtering for a minimum allele frequency), as were SNPs that were genotyped for &lt;50% of individuals in each population (rather than using an overall representation filter). Genetic distance/similarity (Hamming-based) was then calculated between all pairs of individuals to identify clones, with clonal groups reduced to a single representative per population. The remaining SNPs were then evaluated for significant deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using arlecore (v3.5.2.2) (66), with SNPs that deviated (excess or deficit) in more than five populations removed, as well as RAD loci that contained an SNP exhibiting a significant excess in at least one population (to filter out potential paralogous RAD loci).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outliers and private alleles</head><p>Initially, outliers were identified for the overall data set and for pairwise population comparisons (considering only biallelic SNPs) using the Fdist approach (67) as implemented in Lositan (v. 1.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref> and BayeScan (v.2.1) (69). To conservatively identify depth-outliers, we considered those SNPs that were identified in the overall outlier analyses by both Fdist [outside the 99% confidence interval (CI); 50,000 simulations] and BayeScan (using a Bayes factor cutoff of 0.01), as well as those that were identified in at least two of three independent Fdist outlier analyses between individual shallow and deep populations within a location (but never in Fdist outlier analyses within the same depth between different locations). Genotype frequencies of outliers were calculated, and sequences of depth-outlier RAD loci were searched (BLASTN) against the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database for potential gene region identification. To identify a subset of SNPs that was more representative of neutral genomic diversity, we compiled a separate data set (neutral), eliminating SNPs identified in one or both overall outlier analyses using more lenient cutoffs (95% CI for Fdist and a Bayes factor cutoff of 0.05 for BayeScan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic structure</head><p>To assess the genetic structure for the outlier and nonoutlier data set, we wrote a multiprocessing wrapper ("structure_mp") for STRUCTURE (v.2.3.4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>, which takes a Variant Call Format file and converts it into distinct replicate STRUCTURE data sets, each with a single SNP per RAD locus, which are then ran in parallel through STRUCTURE and permutated and summarized in CLUMPP (v.1.1.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>. Four estimators of the number of clusters (MedMeaK, MaxMeaK, Med-MedK, and MaxMedK) were determined using a membership coefficient threshold of 0.5 [sensu Puechmaille <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>]. STRUCTURE runs were conducted using the admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and not considering priors (burn-in of 100,000 and 50,000 reps). Additional STRUCTURE runs were carried out for the eastern populations of A. fragilis (K = 2) for downstream ancestry analysis and for the most differentiated SNPs (90th to 100th percentile) of S. intersepta (based on overall F ST calculated for the original data and when using random population assignments). Genetic structure was also assessed for both species through PCA and DAPC, both using the adegenet R package (v1.3-1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genomic intergradation of shallow and deep individuals</head><p>Patterns of SNP ancestry were assessed for shallow and deep individuals of A. fragilis (eastern populations only) by classifying the data set into two putative "parental" groups (those with an ancestry assignment of &gt;0.98) and an admixed group. We then extracted genotypes for the identified depth-outlier SNPs, as well as other SNPs that had a reference allele frequency differential (Δp) between parental groups of at least 0.5, and plotted for all the individuals sorted by ancestry assignment (similar to the visualization in the R package "introgress") <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population genetics statistics</head><p>To test for overall population structure in both species, we implemented Goudet's G-statistic Monte Carlo test (75) using the "hierfstat" R package (v0.04-10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>, with 99 permutations considering all and the six eastern populations. Inbreeding statistics were estimated per locus among all populations (global estimates) and among all pairs of populations (using the adegenet R package). To determine whether population structure (based on Weir and Cockerham F ST using the hierfstat R package) differed overall among groups of populations, we used a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. To test the specific hypothesis for A. fragilis that differentiation by habitat exceeds differentiation within habitat (as expected under a scenario of divergence by ecology) (77), we compared F ST values obtained from the three shallow-deep pairs against pairwise values for the three possible shallow versus shallow comparisons. For deep versus deep comparisons, we separately examined the three eastern comparisons (mirroring the shallow versus shallow comparisons) and also examined the six total possible comparisons when the western population (WD) was included. All between-habitat versus within-habitat contrasts were conducted using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.</p></div>
