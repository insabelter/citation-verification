<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Salicornia Sinus-Persica Akhani has been discovered in southern Iran, namely in Khuzestan, Bushehr, and Hormozgan, along salty and brackish rivers draining into the Persian Gulf well as estuaries and coastal habitats. Genetic diversity is an essential component of biological variability for conservation methods, particularly for rare and narrowly endemic species. Iran's folk's genetic structure, diversity, and morphological distinctions are unknown. Because of the plant's medicinal value, genetic diversity and folk structure were studied in six regional folks of Salicornia Sinus-Persica Akhani. To emphasize genetic variability within and across people in this plant, we employed six inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and 15 combined IRAP markers. The AMOVA test indicated a substantial genetic difference across the folks investigated (PhiPT = 0.41, P = 0.010), as well as the fact that within-folk variation accounted for 80% of overall genetic diversity and genetic divergence between folks accounted for 20%.

Based on (IRAP) markers, these findings revealed that the regional folks of Salicornia Sinus-Persica are incredibly distinct.</p><p>Key words: Gene flow, IRAP, Salicornia sinus-persica; Population Differentiation INTRODUCTION Salicornia is a halophytic plant that thrives in salt marshes and salty wetlands in Asia, North America, the Middle East, and near coastlines. Salicornia is one of the most varied genera in the Salicornieae family. Approximately 25 to 30 species in the genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(KADEREIT et al., 2007)</ref>. Salicornia species are succulent plants with a jointed horizontal main stem and upright lateral branches that develop to be less than 30 cm tall. Because of the microscopic, scale-like leaves, the plant may seem leafless. Many plants are green throughout the summer, but their leaves change crimson in the fall. The breeze pollinates the hermaphrodite blooms, and the fruit is tiny and tasty, with just one seed.</p><p>Salicornia is a worldwide genus whose taxonomy has been described as "a horrific nightmare" by a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(KADEREIT et al., 2007)</ref>. Only Salicornia europaea L. has been found in Iran, according to HEDGE <ref type="bibr">(1997)</ref> and other works on Iranian flora. However, the author's subsequent extensive field studies in nearly all Salicornia folks in Iran and Turkey, as well as molecular studies (in preparation), co-cultivation experiments, and cytological data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(GHAFFARI et al., 2006)</ref>, revealed rejection of S. Europaea's presence in Iran and the occurrence of a remarkable diversity in Iranian Salicornia. There are at least five other taxa in Central and Southern Iran and the recently identified endemic species S. persica <ref type="bibr">(AKHANI, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, AKHANI, 2008)</ref>. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) The diploid Symphytum Iranica (Iranian Symphytum) Akhani is found in the salines of central Iran. The upright stance and small opposing top spikes define this species. (2) S. sinuspersica In the provinces of Khuzestan, Bushehr, and Hormozgan in southern Iran, Akhani thrives in salty and brackish rivers that flow into the Persian Gulf, as well as estuaries and coastal environments. (3) S. perspolitana Akhani which is found in the salines near the Tashk and Bakhtegan hypersaline lakes in South-Central Iran, is linked to Akhani. It has a yellowish color and a broad branching, ascending to loosely prostrate habit. This is the first species in the genus Salicornia with leaf-like bracts; (4) S. persica subsp. rudshurensis is a horizontal plant with leaflike bracts. Slender spikes with obtuse center bloom separate Akhani, a taxon occurring in the Tehran region of North-Central Iran, from common subspecies; and (5) S. x tashkensis Akhani hybrid is a rumored hybrid that can only be found in Tashk Lake in South-Central Iran.</p><p>Due to the tremendous morphological heterogeneity of this species throughout the nation, infra-specific taxonomy variations of this species may occur. As a result, we conducted folk genetic research and morphometric studies on six regional groups for the first time in the country.</p><p>The inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) approach, which finds insertional polymorphisms by amplifying DNA segments between two retrotransposons, was utilized for genetic research. It's been used in several research on genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(SMYKAL et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The goal of this study was to use the inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) approach to examine genetic diversity across Salicornia Sinus-Persica cultivars/folks</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R E T R A C T E D</formula><p>from various geographical origins, as well as to use IRAP markers to detect genetic variation among and within materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant materials</head><p>In July and August 2019-2020, 40 individuals from six natural folks of Salicornia Sinus-Persica were sampled in the salty and brackish rivers that flow into Iran's the Persian Gulf in the provinces of Khuzestan, Bushehr, and Hormozgan (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Fresh leaves were collected from 5-8 people in each group and dried in Silica Gel right away (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The species (Salicornia sinus-persica) was identified correctly using many sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(KADEREIT et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">AKHANI, 2003)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> show the locations of the samples. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>DNA extraction and IRAP assay Fresh leaves were randomly picked from each research group's 5-10 plants. Silica gel powder was used to dry them. To extract genomic DNA, the CTAB activated charcoal approach was applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2019)</ref>. A 0.8 percent agarose gel was used to evaluate the purity of the isolated DNA.</p></div>

The largest percentage polymorphism (65.05 percent) was observed in Bushehr, 10 kilometers northwest of Borazjan, along the Dalaki River (folk No. 2), indicating a high value for gene diversity (0.34). &amp; Shanon, index of information (0.37). The folk of Khuzestan has the lowest degree of polymorphism (21.53 percent) in Bandare Mahshar, a coastal region near the Mahshar Petrochemical Complex, near Pol-e Sazandegi (No.5), and Shanon, information index (0.10), and Hezbollah, information index (0.10).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population genetic differentiation</head><p>Gst analysis (0.887, p = 0.001) and AMOVA (PhiPT = 0.41, P = 0.010) revealed significant differences between the groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). It was also discovered that genetic variation within folks accounted for 20% of overall genetic diversity, whereas genetic differences between groups accounted for 80%. Pairwise AMOVA results indicated a substantial difference between the two groups. After 999 permutations, we also got strong scores for the Hedrick standardized fixation index (G'st = 0.887, P = 0.001) and the Jost differentiation index (D-est = 0.556, P = 0.001). These findings suggest that regional folks of Salicornia Sinus-Persica differ genetically.  Populations , genetic affinity Plant samples from each folk were grouped in the UPGMA tree, resulting in various groupings. There were no transitional forms among the specimens we examined. These findings revealed that two Salicornia sinus-persica folk clusters or groups might be recognized using IRAP data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In genetic and breeding studies, folk genetics evaluations are crucial. Genetic diversity, genetic variability partitioning within and across folks, inbreeding and outcrossing, folk bottlenecks, and effective folk size are all covered <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(BI et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">CHENG et al., 2021)</ref>. The use of molecular markers has substantially aided folk genetic investigations. These markers have been used to identify possible genotype differences among the several Salicornia accessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(MA et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">PENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">SI et al., 2021)</ref>. In recent years, RAPD, AFLP, inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), simple sequence repeat (SSR), and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) has been used to assess genetic variation and relationships in cultivars and landraces <ref type="bibr">(WIESNEROVA and WIESNER, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">SALARI et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">YIN et al., 2021)</ref>. The majority of plant genomes are transposable elements, predominantly retrotransposons. Because their replication produces genetic variation, they are a rich source of molecular markers (SMYKAL et <ref type="bibr">al., 2011)</ref>. The inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) approach reveals insertional polymorphisms by boosting DNA segments between two retrotransposons. It's been utilized in several research on genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(ZHENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHU et al., 2021)</ref>. Salicornia Sinus-persica distributed has the same distribution as some other endemic species found in the Persian Gulf and Oman. Bienertia sinus persici was recently a fascinating example <ref type="bibr">(AKHANI et al., 2005)</ref>. Most of the endemics of the Persian Gulf area have an Irano-Turanian origin, as recently described on the phytogeographical importance of Heliotropium species <ref type="bibr">(AKHANI, 2007)</ref>, providing good evidence for ZOHARY <ref type="bibr">(1973)</ref> and LÉONARD's consideration of this area as part of the Irano-Turanian area rather than Sudanian or <ref type="bibr">Saharo-Sindian (1989)</ref>. This research aimed to assess the genetic diversity of Iranian Salicornia Sinus-Persica to conserve the species' germplasm. The data acquired on genetic diversity across and within folks will pave the way for effective conservation strategies. The current study discovered that Iranian-Salicornia Sinus-Persica is exceptionally diversified due to local genetic origins, breeding pressure, and/or restricted genetic material exchange. The unique nature of the Iranian Salicornia Sinus-Persica germplasm is highlighted by our findings, emphasizing the need for more extensive characterization, conservation, and breeding techniques. IRAP markers were quite helpful in determining genetic diversity among Iranians. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the findings of this molecular technique to fingerprint the 6 Salicornia Sinus-Persica folks. The 6 primers amplified 77 bands, with an average of 6 bands per primer and 60 (88%) polymorphic bands. The overall number of amplified fragments was between 5 and 12, whereas polymorphic fragments were between 4 and 12.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R E T R A C T E D</formula><p>A species' genetic variety is critical to its survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(HENDRY, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2017b,c,d;</ref><ref type="bibr">JIA et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">JI et al., 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr">JI et al., , 2020b))</ref>. Because Salicornia Sinus-Persica is a selfing plant with regeneration occurring within the species folk, which confers diversity, AMOVA analysis shows that percentages within and among people are relative. Because Salicornia Sinus-Persica is a selfing plant with regeneration occurring within the species folk, this causes Drift, founder effects, and local selection may all play a role in folk phenotypic and allelic variability <ref type="bibr">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018b,c,d)</ref>. </p></div>

Syst. Bot., 30(2): 290-301. Akhani je opisana od južnog Irana u provincijama Khuzestan, Bushehr i Hormozgan duž slanih i bočatih reka koje vode do Persijskog zaliva i estuara i obalnih staništa. Genetski diverzitet je jedan aspekt biološke raznovrsnosti koji je izuzetno važan za strategije očuvanja, posebno retkih i usko endemičnih vrsta. Nema informacija o njegovoj populacijskoj genetičkoj strukturi, genetskoj raznolikosti i morfološkoj varijabilnosti u Iranu. Zbog medicinskog značaja ove vrste, sprovedeno je proučavanje genetske varijabilnosti i strukture populacija na šest geografskih populacija Salicornia sinus-persica Akhani. Korišćeno je šest markera inter-retrotransposon pojačanog polimorfizma (IRAP) i 15 kombinovanih IRAP markera da bismo otkrili unutar i među populacijsku genetsku raznovrsnost u ovoj biljci. AMOVA test je proizveo značajnu genetsku razliku (PhiPT = 0,41, P = 0,010) među proučavanim populacijama i takođe je otkrio da je 80% ukupne genetske varijabilnosti posledica unutar populacijske raznolikosti, dok je 20% posledica genetske diferencijacije među populacijama. Mantel test je pokazao pozitivnu značajnu korelaciju između genetske udaljenosti i geografske udaljenosti ispitivanih populacija. Analiza STRUCTURE i test raspodele populacije otkrili su određeni stepen protoka gena među ovim populacijama. PCoA dijagram populacija bio je u saglasnosti sa UPGMA grupisanjem molekularnih podataka. Ovi rezultati su pokazali da su geografske populacije Salicornia sinus-persica dobro diferencirane na osnovu IRAP markera.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Izvod</cell></row><row><cell>Received, May 06 th , 2020 Accepted August 18 th , 2021 AKHANI, H.
