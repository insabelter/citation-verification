<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the development of computer technology, information technology, and 3D reconstruction technology of the medical human body, 3D virtual digital human body technology for human health has been widely used in various fields of medicine, especially in teaching students of application and anatomy. Its advantage is that it can view 3D human anatomy models from any angle and can be cut in any direction. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm based on a hybrid density network and an element-level attention mechanism. 'e hybrid density network is used to generate feasible hypotheses for multiple 3D poses, solve the ambiguity problem in pose reasoning from 2D to 3D, and improve the performance of the network by adding the AReLU function combined with an element-wise attention mechanism. Teaching students in anatomy makes students' learning more convenient and teachers' teaching explanations more vivid. Comparative experiments show that the accuracy of 3D human pose estimation using a single image input is better than the other two-stage methods.</p></div>

Due to many factors such as preservative preservation conditions and cadaver sources, there is an abnormal lack of cadaveric specimens for teaching and scientific research, and the preservatives are toxic and harmful, which seriously affect people's physical and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. Current computer technology, image processing technology, and human anatomy continue to integrate and develop rapidly. All providing technical support for the digitization and precision of human specimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. During the development of human specimen digitization, many scholars have used MRI, CT, and other medical imaging equipment to obtain data information of human tissue structures for the study of human 3D structure reconstruction and have achieved certain results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. However, due to the low resolution and poor clarity of MRI and CT, the visualization of soft tissues such as ligaments, fascia, and muscles is blurred, and the true texture colour information of organs and tissues cannot be displayed, which brings great subjectivity and uncertainty to the objective reflection of the spatial location relationship of the adjacent structures of tissues and organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Europe, the United States, Japan, and other developed countries in the 1970s began to carry out research on threedimensional anthropometric technology and developed a variety of three-dimensional anthropometric systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. 'e development status of three-dimensional anthropometric technology mainly includes three aspects such as measurement parameter extraction technology, measurement methods, and representative three-dimensional anthropometric equipment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In the mid-1990s, with the gradual commercialization of 3D scanning equipment, structured light 3D scanning technology, as a high-tech digital technology with unique advantages such as stable imaging results, high accuracy, and</p></div>

'e use of structured light three-dimensional scanning technology to complete the acquisition of human structural data and the construction of the human body's three-dimensional anatomical structure, to obtain a highly accurate colour visualization of the digital model, whether in terms of accuracy, texture, colour, and texture information, has its unique advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. 'e attention mechanism, as the name suggests, is a technology that enables the model to focus on important information and fully learn and absorb it. It is not a complete model, but a technology that can act on any sequence model.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm based on a hybrid density network and EAM. 'e hybrid density network is used to generate feasible hypotheses for multiple 3D poses, to solve the ambiguity problem when reasoning from 2D to 3D poses, and to improve the performance of the network by adding an AReLU function combining the element-wise attention mechanism and the ReLU activation function, in order to provide information and relevant morphological data for the development of human specimen digitization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model Building</head><p>3.1. Mixed Density Networks. Since 2D pose estimation of the 3D pose has deep uncertainty, according to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, the hybrid density network proposed by Bishop <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> can be used to estimate the prediction uncertainty. By training a set of hybrid density networks and combining the parameters of different hybrid density networks to predict the parameters of the probability density, the final prediction result is obtained.</p><p>'e overall goal of this paper is to estimate the human joint positions in 3D space given a 2D input. Since the input is a known 2D skeletal sequence x ∈ R 2n (where R is the set of real numbers) and the output is a series of points in 3D space y ∈ R 3n , a function f: R 2n ⟶ R 3n can be learned that minimises the prediction error over a dataset of N poses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">A ReLU Activation Function</head><p>. 'e element-by-element based attention mechanism cited in this paper is the most fine-grained in that it allows each element of the feature vector to receive a different attention value. For each element to have an independent attention value, an elemental attention graph corresponding to the input feature vector needs to be learned <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. 'e activation function introduces nonlinearity into artificial neural networks and is crucial to the expressiveness and learning dynamics of the network. By the nature of the ReLU activation function, the attention module causes positive elements to be scaled up and suppresses negative elements, so that the attention graph scales the elements according to their symbols. 'is will make the network training more resistant to gradient disappearance, thus improving the performance of the network structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Let V � v i 􏼈 􏼉 ∈ R W×H×C be the input feature vector, and compute the attention graph over the entire feature vector. S � s i 􏼈 􏼉 ∈ R W×H×C represents the attention graph, containing the attention value corresponding to each element. A function ψ is used to reconcile the feature graph and the input feature vector to obtain the output ψ(v i s i ). ψ is multiplied element-by-element, and in order to perform element-by-element multiplication, it is necessary to first extend S to the entire dimension of V. Element-wise signbased attention (ELSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> is an element-based attention mechanism for defining an attention-based activation function by the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s i � Φ v i , Θ 􏼁 � C(α), v i &lt; 0, σ(β), v i ≥ 0, 􏼨<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where Θ � {α, β} is the learnable parameter; C(-) trims the input variables to [0.01, 0.99]; and σ(-) is the Sigmoid activation function. It can be seen that the positive and negative elements in the ELSA receive different levels of attention from α and β, respectively. 'erefore, this attention mechanism will give reasonable attention values based on the current input symbol values. 'e ELSA can be represented in the network layer as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L x i , α, β 􏼁 � C(α)x i , x i &lt; 0, σ(β)x i , x i ≥ 0. 􏼨<label>(6)</label></formula><p>When constructing an activation function using ELSA, it is combined with the ReLU activation function, which is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R ′ x i 􏼁 � 0, x i &lt; 0, x i , x i ≥ 0. 􏼨<label>(7)</label></formula><p>'e AReLU activation function for the combination of the two is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Γ x i , α, β 􏼁 � R ′ x i 􏼁 + L x i , α, β 􏼁 � C(α)x i , x i &lt; 0, (1 + σ(β))x i , x i ≥ 0. 􏼨 (8)</formula><p>It can be found that when the input is activated, it is greater than zero. 'e AReLU amplifies the gradient and helps to avoid the gradient from disappearing as 1 + σ(β) &gt; 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Our Models</head><p>'e structure of the 3D human pose estimation network is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. First, the 2D off-node coordinates are fed into the 3D human pose estimator. 'e first line layer of the feature extractor raises the input of dimension 32 (16 2D offnode coordinates of dimension 32) into a 1024-dimensional feature space and uses the ReLU activation function in this layer. Subsequently, the residuals are joined by two residual blocks, each with two linear layers, to which the AReLU activation function is added. Finally, the output of the neural network is varied in the hypothesis generator so that each of the three linear layers outputs three parameters: the mixing coefficient, the mean, and the variance, where the mean u i of each Gaussian kernel represents a 3D pose hypothesis. 'ree different activation functions are used to constrain the corresponding three parameters: a softmax function is used for the mixing coefficients, and an mELU function is used to constrain the variance; a standard linear layer is used for the mean, and the output dimension of this layer is 240 (the dimension of the coordinates of the 16 3D nodes is 48, and there are 5 Gaussian kernels in this paper).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Validation Assessment.</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, each of the 15 movements in the test set was evaluated using the officially recommended test sets S9 and S11 of the Human3.6M dataset. 'e Euclidean distance of each joint point was calculated by comparing the reconstructed pose hypothesis with the real annotation data. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> indicates the mean value of the coordinate errors calculated for each active joint point. 'e method in this paper reduces the average error by 9 mm compared to the benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> and by 7 mm compared to the hybrid density network only <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, which indicates that the accuracy of 3D human pose estimation can be improved in this paper by constructing a hybrid density network and applying the AReLU activation function on the network layer. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> represents the average correlation point error based on the Procrustes analysis. 'e network output is first rigidly transformed (translation, rotation, and scaling) to align with the real annotated data, and then the average of the nodal errors is calculated. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, the average error after Procrustes alignment is also lower than that of the benchmark. 'is indicates that the application of the reasonable AReLU activation function in this paper has good data amativeness and mitigates the gradient disappearance problem at the network layer, thus improving the performance of the network and reducing the average nodal error <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. 'e first column of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the original input 2D poses, the second column shows the true 3D annotation, and the remaining 5 columns show the 5 hypothetical poses predicted by the 3D pose estimator. It can be seen that all 5 pose hypotheses are different from each other, which increases the uncertainty of the training and gives the neural network more information to facilitate the learning of the model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the 3D pose visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>.</p></div>

'e right panel in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a visualization of the 3D body pose prediction results corresponding to the 2D node coordinates entered into the left panel, with the output of 17 3D offnodes. Since the model was trained with only 16 3D nodes, the hip joint was added to the 3D human pose visualization after the model was trained. 'e results accurately reflect the 3D human posture and the 3D spatial coordinates of each part of the body in the 3D grid space.</p></div>
