<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To investigate the characteristics of psychological symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to study the relationship between psychological symptoms and quality of life, and to provide some theoretical basis for the corresponding psychological treatment of IBD patients with psychiatric abnormalities. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its gradual application to the medical field, it has brought new ideas to the medical development, and its research and application in IBD, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is increasing. Machine learning is used to select reasonable models and methods to help the prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of IBD. In this study, we improved on the classical unidirectional LSTM model by adding backward and forward LSTM layers, designed a bidirectional LSTM model to improve the shortcomings of unidirectional LSTM with insufficient dependence on the posterior, introduced the contribution rate α to adjust the weight matrix of the forward LSTM layer and the backward LSTM layer, and experimentally verified the correctness and superiority of the proposed model. A total of 159 patients with IBD and 89 healthy people were collected and psychologically assessed using the general status questionnaire, the 90-item symptom checklist (SCL-90). Patients with IBD are prone to a combination of obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal, depressive, hostile, and other abnormal psychological symptoms, and their quality of life is significantly reduced; quality of life is mainly affected by disease condition, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and paranoia, and patients in the active stage of the disease with heavy symptoms of depression, paranoia, and interpersonal sensitivity have low quality of life.</p></div>

UC most often occurs in young adults, with a peak incidence of 20-49 years old and little difference between males and females according to Chinese statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, while CD most often occurs in young adults, with a peak incidence of 18-35 years old and slightly more males than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, with approximately equal incidence of UC and CD <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. )e clinical manifestations of both diseases are very similar, such as mucopurulent stools, abdominal pain, and various degrees of systemic symptoms, and the diagnosis is made based on a comprehensive analysis combining clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, endoscopy, imaging, and histopathological examinations to exclude infectious and other noninfectious colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</p><p>AI is a branch of computer science that allows computers to perform activities that are normally possible with intelligent beings. AI in a broad sense covers machine learning and robotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Machine learning (ML) is the development of an algorithm that allows a computer to learn from big data to make predictions about unknown events <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Along with the rise of AI, the combination of medical imaging and AI is considered to be the most promising area <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>As a major form of AI, ML is an application that performs iterative modeling by employing several methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</p><p>For classification, the most common approach is to use a subset of genes to obtain phenotypic features of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, a new and generalization individualized pathwaybased classification method, probabilistic pathway score (PROPS) was proposed, which uses a Gaussian Bayesian network to create personalized features reflecting pathway activity and applies these pathway-based features to distinguish between chronic disease and ulcerative colitis, and this method is excellent. )e results show that PROPS outperforms existing IBD classifiers and alternative approaches in terms of performance and is useful for distinguishing between UC and CD even when the pathways known to be shared by both show different activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Resulting in a segmentation method that combines SSL and AI to give a segmentation method that optimally, this method has fewer samples and less training effort than the FSL method, and the segmentation accuracy is higher. Recently, a newly developed feature selection algorithm (doubly randomized preference trial, DRPT) combined with the SVM classifier generated a model to distinguish healthy subjects from UC subjects based on the expression values of 32 genes in colon samples; the model perfectly detected all active cases and showed good performance in the final model for detecting UC performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network Model</head><p>)e most widely used character labeling method in academia is the four-word bit labeling set, B, M, E, S, where B (begin) represents the beginning character of the labeled word, M (middle) represents the middle character of the labeled word, E (end) represents the ending character of the labeled word, and S (single) represents the labeled word as a single character. Determine the corresponding label for each character in the character sequence. A simple model of IBD based on a bidirectional LSTM neural network is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Text Vectorization Layer.</head><p>To use neural network models to process data, the input data need to be factorized first. )ere are two main ways of text factorization. )e similarity between words cannot be well characterized, which is also known as the lexical gap problem. Word2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> is a toolkit for acquiring word vectors, which was open-sourced by Google in 2013 and is simple, efficient, and easy to use. )e experimental part of this study uses Word2Vec as the first layer to preprocess the input data into word embedding vectors. )e word annotation-based word separation method is then based on a local sliding window, assuming that the label of a world greatly depends on the word in its neighboring position.</p></div>

We also introduce a contribution rate variable α to adjust the contribution of the two independent one-way LSTM layers to the subsequent data, which is weighted and input to the hidden layer for linear transformation to obtain a vector of equal dimensionality to the label set.</p></div>

Early on, behavioral changes similar to human mood disorders were found in rats with chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Later, as more in-depth studies and research on IBD were conducted, it was recognized that psychosomatic factors were closely related to IBD. In an analysis of IBD studies published from 2005 to 2014, 19.1% had anxiety and 21.2% had depression compared to the healthy population and 66.4% had anxiety and 34.7% had depression in active IBD compared to remission <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. A national survey of a large sample of IBD patients in Canada showed that IBD with generalized anxiety disorder was twice as likely as non-IBD patients. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows status of different patients.</p><p>Patients with IBD are not only prone to a combination of abnormal psychology but also have a variety of components that affect their mental health in many ways. )is may be due to the fact that IBD is a chronic disease with recurrent, unpredictable, and systemic disease characteristics, which makes patients suffer from the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In addition, although IBD mainly affects the gastrointestinal system, 70% of patients with IBD develop complications such as gastrointestinal perforation or stricture within 10 years of diagnosis, requiring surgical resection or hospitalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, incurring high treatment costs, and causing a burden on life <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, which can easily produce symptoms such as anxiety and depression to varying degrees. Patients have a variety of abnormal psychological symptoms, which can be manifested as melancholy and bitterness, loss of enthusiasm for life, reduced activity; increased sense of inferiority, self-blame; hypersensitivity and irritability; and in severe cases, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>)e results of this study showed that the IBD group was impaired in all dimensions except the mental health dimension compared to normal controls. It indicates that the quality of life of IBD patients is impaired compared to healthy individuals. )e IBDQ is a scale developed for IBD patients that better reflects the quality of life of IBD patients in four dimensions, including intestinal symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional functioning, and social functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. )e results of this study showed that patients with IBD with abnormal psychological symptoms had lower scores in the total score, systemic symptoms, intestinal symptoms, and emotional functioning compared with patients with IBD without abnormal psychological symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. )is suggests that abnormal psychological symptoms can affect patients' systemic and intestinal symptoms and impair their emotional functioning. )e reason for this may be that IBD mostly presents with intestinal manifestations such as chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea, blood in stool, and systemic manifestations such as loss of body mass, fatigue,  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Although AI has achieved brilliant results in many studies, some of them are not very promising. In the construction of AI deep learning models for colonoscopy-assisted diagnosis, the specificity of detecting ulcerative colitis was 67%, which is still lacking.

Considering the general characteristics of AI models and the unavailability or transparency in computing progress, external validation of AI models is always challenging.
