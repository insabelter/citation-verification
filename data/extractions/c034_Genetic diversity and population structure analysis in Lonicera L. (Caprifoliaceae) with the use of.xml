<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Species delimitation is essential since species is regarded as the basic unit of analysis in nearly all biological disciplines, such as ecology, biogeography, conservation biology, and macroevolution. The genus Lonicera, which includes approximately 200 species, is a major component of the family Caprifoliaceae, comprising a large number of horticultural and economically important shrubs and tree species. This genus is represented in Iran by 9 species. In spite vast distribution of many Lonicera species that grow in Iran, there are not any available report on their genetic diversity, mode of divergence and patterns of dispersal. Therefore data molecular (ISSR markers) with four primer pairs generated 77 polymorphic bands.and morphological studies of 70 accessions from 7 species of Lonicera, that were collected from different habitats in Iran were performed. The aims of the present study are: 1) to find the diagnostic value of ISSR markers in delimitation of Lonicera species, 2) to find the genetic structure of these taxa in Iran, and 3) to investigate the .species inter-relationship. The present study revealed that combination of morphological and ISSR data can delimit the species. AMOVA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that the species of Lonicera are genetically differentiated but have some degree of shared common alleles.</p></div>

In the flora of Iran, the genus Lonicera is represented by nine species <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(KHATAMSAZ, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">GHAHREMANINEJAD and EZAZI, 2009)</ref> across the north, northwest and northeast of the country. Some species are medicinal plants <ref type="bibr">(ZENG et al., 2017)</ref>. Dried Lonicera flowers and buds are known as Flos Lonicera and have been a recognized herb in the traditional Chinese medicine for more than 1500 years. It has been applied for treatment of arthritis, diabetes mellitus, fever, and viral infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(SHANG et al., 2011)</ref>. The plants are erect shrubs, occasionally small trees. Members of Lonicera are characterized by opposite, narrowly elliptic to obovate leaves, white, yellow, reddish, or purple-red corolla with capitate stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(JUDD et al., 2007)</ref>, and undulate calyx margin. In Flora Iranica, WENDELBO <ref type="bibr">(1965)</ref> classified 19 species of the Lonicera into two subgenera (Chamaecerasus and Lonicera) and three sections, namely Isoxylosteum, Isika and Coeloxylosteum. The four studied species belong to subgenus Chamaecerasus and sections Isika and Coeloxylosteum.</p><p>Molecular data have been obtained in phylogenetic studies and species divergence researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(KAZEMPOUR OSALOO et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">2005)</ref>. These data can also provide supportive and extra criteria for systematic classification of the studied species that have been based only on the morphological characters <ref type="bibr">(CHASE et al., 1993)</ref>. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is the region of the 18S-5.8 S-26S nuclear ribosomal cistron <ref type="bibr">(BALDWIN et al., 1995)</ref>. The spacers contain the signals needed to process the rRNA transcript <ref type="bibr">(BALDWIN, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">BALDWIN et al., 1995)</ref> and have often been used for inferring phylogeny at the generic and infrageneric levels in plants (e.g. <ref type="bibr">BALDWIN, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">BALDWIN et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">KAZEMPOUR OSALOO et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">2005)</ref>. THEIS et al. <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> studied phylogenetics of the Caprifolieae and Lonicera (Dipsacales) on the basis of nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences. Their analysis indicates monophyly in Lonicera and highlights instances of homoplasy in several morphological characters. Molecular phylogenetics of Lonicera in Japan has been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">NAKAJI et al. (2015)</ref> on the basis of chloroplast DNA sequences. Lonicera is well known for its taxonomic complexity resulting from overlapping morphological characters.</p><p>In the past four decades, researchers have developed several molecular marker techniques, including inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(MA et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">PENG et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">SI et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">ZOU et al, 2019)</ref>. ISSR is rapid, inexpensive, simple, and efficient DNA marker method that does not require prior knowledge of the DNA sequence or large amounts of starting DNA template.

Therefore, we performed morphological and molecular study of 7 collected species of Lonicera. The project try to answer the following questions: 1) Is there infra-and inter-specific genetic diversity among studied species? 2) Is genetic distance among these species correlated with their geographical distance?</p><p>3) What is the genetic structure of populations and taxa? 4) Is there any gene exchange between Lonicera species in Iran? Therefore it is important to delimit the identified species for performing further detailed molecular studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species delimitation and inter-relationship Morphometry</head><p>ANOVA showed significant differences (P&lt;0.01) in quantitative morphological characters among the species studied. In order to determine the most variable characters among the taxa studied, PCA analysis has been performed. It revealed that the first three factors comprised over 77% of the total variation. In the first PCA axis with 40% of total variation, such characters as shape of petals, shape of sepals, peduncles and pedicels hair, stem hair, petiols hair density have shown the highest correlation (&gt;0.7). Length of bract and pedicel, length and width of the petal, length and width of stem leaves were characters influencing PCA axis 2 and 3 respectively. Different clustering and ordination methods produced similar results therefore, UPGMA clustering and PCA plot of morphological characters are presented here (Figure . 2 and 3). In general, plant samples of each species, were grouped together and formed separate cluster. This result show that morphological characters studied can delimit Lonicera species in two different major clusters or groups. In the studied specimens we did not encounter intermediate forms. In general, two major clusters were formed in WARD tree (Figure . 2). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>Populations of Lonicera floribunda, L. iberica and L. hypoleuca were placed in the first major cluster and were placed with great distance from the other species. The second major cluster included two sub-clusters. Plants of L. nummulariifolia, L. caucasica and L. korolkowii comprised the first sub-cluster, while plants of L. bracteolaris formed the second sub-cluster.</p><p>The PCA plot of morphological characters (Figure . Not included) separated the species into distinct groups with no inter-mixing. This is in agreement with WARD tree presented before. The plants of L. nummulariifolia showed more similarity to L. bracteolaris and were placed close to each other, Similarly, plants of L. iberica and L. caucasica were placed close to each other due to morphological similarity and were separated from the other species.</p></div>

All 3 primer AGC) 5GT, UBC 810, (GA) 9T produced 60 bands, while the lowest level of bands for (AGC) 5GG with 17 bands. For each ISSR locus were estimated by calculating Na, Ne, I and He and uHe index for each locus ranged from (0-0.09), (0.05-0.07), (0.0-0.2) and (0-0.1) respectively (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>Genetic diversity parameters determined in the studied species (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) revealed that Lonicera floribunda (sp1) had the highest level of genetic polymorphism (65.91%), while the lowest level of genetic polymorphism (10.38%) occurred in L. nummulariifolia (sp3). Lonicera floribunda also had the highest values for effective number of alleles (Ne = 1.310) and Shannon information index (I =0.293).</p><p>AMOVA test showed significant genetic difference (P = 0.001) among studied species. It revealed that 75% of total variation was among species and 25% was within species. Pair-wise FST values showed significant difference among all studied species (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Moreover, genetic differentiation of these species was demonstrated by significant Nei's GST (0.44, P = 0.02) and D_est values (0.155, P = 0.01). Non-metric MDS plots of ISSR data (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) showed higher within species genetic diversity in the species number 1(Lonicera floribunda), supporting genetic diversity parameters obtained (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). The MDS plot separated the species into distinct groups. This indicates that ISSR molecular markers can be used in Lonicera species delimitation. This is in agreement with AMOVA and genetic diversity parameters presented before. The species are genetically well differentiated from each other. The Nm analysis by Popgene software also produced mean Nm= 0.31, that is considered very low value of gene flow among the studied species. </p></div>

This dendrogram showed close genetic affinity between L. iberica and L. hypoleuca supporting our morphological result presented before (Figure . 2). The other Lonicera species were placed closer to each other based on ISSR data, but their genetic affinity is not evident as is in morphology tree.   The species genetic STRUCTURE We performed STRUCTURE analysis followed by the Evanno test to identify the optimal number of genetic groups. We used the admixture model to illustrate interspecific gene flow or/and ancestrally shared alleles in the species studied.</p><p>STRUCTURE analysis followed by Evanno test produced ΔK =7. The STRUCTURE plot (Figure . Not included) produced more detailed information about the genetic structure of the species studied as well as shared ancestral alleles and/or gene flow among Lonicera species. This plot revealed that Genetic affinity between L. korolkowii and Lonicera floribunda (similarly colored, No. 1, 7), as well as L. iberica and L. hypoleuca (sp No. 2,6) due to shared common alleles. This is in agreement with Neighbor joining dendrogram presented before. The other species are distinct in their allele composition.</p><p>The low Nm value (0.31) indicates limited gene flow or ancestrally shared alleles between the species studied and supports genetic stratification as indicated by K-Means and STRUCTURE analyses. Population assignment test also agreed with Nm result and could not identify significant gene flow among members of the studied species. However, reticulogram obtained based on the least square method (Figure is not included), revealed some amount of shared alleles between species 2 and 6 and between 1 and 7 also between 1 and 3. As evidenced by STRUCTURE plot based on admixture model, these shared alleles comprise very limited part of the genomes in species studied and all these results are in agreement in showing a high degree of genetic stratification in species studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species delimitation and taxonomic consideration</head><p>Lonicera is one of the most important genera of Caprifoliaceae. Morphological analyses of the studied Lonicera species showed that they are well differentiated from each other both in quantitative measures (the ANOVA test result) and qualitative characters (The PCA plot result). In addition, PCA analysis suggests that characters like pedicel length, bract length, calyx shape, petal shape, length and width of stem-leaf, length and width of petal, peduncle and pedicel hair, habit and petal claw could be used in species groups delimitation.</p><p>Four species and 12 populations of the genus Lonicera have been studied in terms of pollen and seed micro-morphology and molecular phylogeny ( <ref type="bibr">AMINI et al., 2019)</ref>. Their results showed that micro-morphological and molecular data provide reliable evidence for</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R E T R A C T E D</formula><p>differentiation of some populations from others. Since Lonicera systematically is a problem genus, it is necessary to use alternative methods to distinguish its taxa. Statistical evaluation of taxa can be used for taxa delimitation. The present study intends to provide further evidence for taxonomists, so as to help them in separating these seven species. Our morphological results support close affinity between L. iberica and L. hypoleuca, as well as between L. korolkowii and L. bracteolaris, and these results are consistent with molecular findings. Our results correspond with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">THEIS et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">NAKAJI et al. (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic structure and gene flow</head><p>Population genetic study provides valuable information about genetic structure of plants, the stratification versus gene flow among the species populations, genetic divergence of the populations, etc. <ref type="bibr">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI, 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018c;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018d;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHU et al, 2021)</ref>. This information have different applications, and from pure understanding of biology of the species to conservation of endangered species, choosing of proper parents for hybridization and breeding and phylogeography and mechanism of invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(FREELAND et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">YIN et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>AMOVA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that the species of this genus are genetically differentiated but have some degree of shared common alleles. Several trends in pollination mechanism can be observed in Lonicera species with gradual transition between them. According to PHILIPP <ref type="bibr">(1985)</ref>, the methods we used are indirect estimation of gene flow and if it is identified to occur among species may be either due to ancestral shared alleles or ongoing gene flow. The Nm value obtained based on ISSR data, revealed very limited amount of gene flow among the studied species that was also supported by STRUCTURE analysis as Lonicera species mostly had distinct genetic structure. Reticulation analysis also showed some degree of gene flow for ISSR. We did not observe any intermediate forms in our extensive plant collection, but morphological variability within each species did occur to some extent. Therefore, the low degree of gene flow identified by indirect methods applied may be due to a low degree of gene flow both ancestral shared alleles and ongoing gene.</p><p>In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr">CHEN et al. (2012)</ref>, 20 ISSR primers amplified 186 bands with 103 (54.63%) polymorphic bands and 58 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) primer combinations amplified 591 bands with 347 (55.46%) polymorphic bands. Both ISSR and SRAP analyses revealed a middle level of genetic diversity in Lonicera macranthoides cultivars. <ref type="bibr">SMOLIK et al. (2006)</ref> found a level of similarity for 6 populations of Lonicera periclymenum ranging from 82.3% to 86.6%, indicating their closely related nature. ISSR amplification was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">SMOLIK et al. (2010)</ref> to analyze polymorphisms of microsatellite sequences in the honeysuckle genome and to evaluate genetic diversity among 14 Polish and Russian blue honeysuckle accessions. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">NAUGŽEMYS et al. (2011)</ref> to assess the genetic relationships among 51 accessions of blue honeysuckle. The pairwise genetic distance (GDxy) values among studied accessions ranged from 0.054 to 0.479; the mean GDxy was 0.283. Knowledge of the content of secondary metabolites in individual genotypes allows us to choose the best in Lonicera breeding programs in order to increase the nutritional value and health benefits.</p></div>

It is important for the mobility and evolution of plant populations and can be calculated using the following formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(MCDERMOTT and MCDONALD, 1993)</ref>: Nm = 0.5 (1 -GST)/GST.</p><p>WRIGHT <ref type="bibr">(1951)</ref> reported that Nm values greater than 1 indicate that gene flow is occurring between populations. In the present study, Nm among varietal populations of Lonicera was 0.31, indicating a low level of Nm and a high degree of genetic differentiation. Nm among budtype varieties populations was even lower, at 0.110. To conclude, the present study revealed the use of ISSR molecular markers along with morphological characters in Lonicera species delimitation. Some degrees of interspecific genetic admixture occur in Lonicera, but the studied species are strongly differentiated during the speciation process and invasion in new habitats. Genetic drift, strong inbreeding, and local adaptation are effective evolutionary forces operating in Lonicera species and population divergence and adaptation.</p><p>Plant species delimitation is of central importance in phylogenetic systematics, evolution, biogeography and biodiversity. It is significant to infer patterns and mechanisms of speciation and hybridization, the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise and gene flow between closely related phylogenetic species can occur <ref type="bibr">(DUMINIL and DI MICHELE, 2009)</ref>. Isolation by distance, local adaptation and gene flow are different mechanisms responsible for species differentiation and genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(FREELAND et al., 2011)</ref>.  </p></div>

A Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation was run 20 times for each value of K after a burn-in period of 10 5 . The Evanno test was performed on STRUCTURE result to determine proper number of K by using delta K value(EVANNO et al., 2005). In K-Means clustering, two summary statistics, pseudo-F, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) provide the best fit for k (MEIRMANS, 2012).Gene flow was determined by (i) Calculating Nm an estimate of gene flow from Gst by PopGene ver.1.32 (1997)  as: Nm = 0.5(1 -Gst)/Gst. This approach considers the equal amount of gene flow among all populations. (ii) Population assignment test based on maximum likelihood as performed in Genodive ver. in GenoDive ver. 2. (2013). The presence of shared alleles was determined by drawing the reticulogram network based on the least square method by DARwin ver 5. (2012).</figDesc></figure>

Rod Lonicera, koji obuhvata približno 200 vrsta, glavna je komponenta porodice Caprifoliaceae, koja obuhvata veliki broj hortikulturnih i ekonomski važnih grmova i vrsta drveća. Ovaj rod je u Iranu zastupljen sa 9 vrsta. Uprkos velikoj rasprostranjenosti mnogih vrsta Lonicera koje rastu u Iranu, nema dostupnih izveštaja o njihovoj genetskoj raznolikosti, načinu divergencije i obrascima širenja. Zbog toga su molekularni podaci (ISSR markeri) sa četiri para prajmera generisali 77 polimorfnih traka. Izvršena su i morfološka ispitivanja 70 pristupa iz 7 vrsta Lonicera, koji su prikupljeni sa različitih staništa u Iranu. Ciljevi ove studije su: 1) pronaći dijagnostičku vrednost ISSR markera u razgraničenju vrsta Lonicera, 2) pronaći genetsku strukturu ovih taksona u Iranu, i 3) istražiti povezanost između vrsta. AMOVA i STRUCTURE analiza otkrile su da su vrste Lonicera genetski diferencirane, ali imaju određeni stepen zajedničkih alela.</figDesc><table /><note><p>Primljeno 02.VIII.2020. Odobreno 18.
