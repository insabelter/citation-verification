<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study is devoted to the numerical assessment of the influence of helical baffle on the hydrothermal aspects and irreversibility behavior of the turbulent forced convection flow of water-CuO nanofluid (NF) inside a hairpin heat exchanger with 100 mm length, 10 mm inner tube internal diameter, and 15 mm outer diameter internal diameter. The variations of the first-law and secondlaw performance metrics are investigated in terms of Reynolds number (Re = 5000-10,000), volume concentration of NF ( ϕ = 0 -4% ) and baffle pitch (B = 25-100 mm). The results show that the NF Nusselt number grows with the rise of both the Re and ϕ whereas it declines with the rise of B. In addition, the outcomes depicted that the rise of both Re and ϕ results in the rise of pressure drop, while it declines with the increase of B. Moreover, it was found that the best thermal performance of NF is equal to 1.067, which belongs to the case B = 33.3 mm, ϕ=2%, and Re = 10,000. Furthermore, it was shown that irreversibilities due to fluid friction and heat transfer augment with the rise of Re while the rise of B results in the decrease of frictional irreversibilities. Finally, the outcomes revealed that with the rise of B, the heat transfer irreversibilities first intensify and then diminish.</p></div>

This equipment is called turbulator, and so far, various types of turbulators were introduced and their performance was studied experimentally and numerically. Also, the use of nanostructures was developed to increase the efficiency of engineering systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</p><p>Although the use of turbulators has led to an improvement in the performance of heat transfer systems, this has not prevented researchers from looking for ways to further improve the performance of these systems. One of these amazing techniques, which are originated from the low thermal conductivity of heat transfer fluids, is the use of nanofluids (NFs) instead of common heat transfer fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Choi <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> first made these modern fluids and called them NFs. After the introduction of NFs and their amazing thermal properties, much research was done on their performance in diverse applications such as thermal management of electronic components <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and photovoltaic panels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , nuclear applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and performance improvement of solar thermal collectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> , heat exchangers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and car radiators <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . The literature inspection shows that the performance of thermal systems with NF coolants equipped with turbulators was investigated by various researchers. Bellos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> analyzed the efficacy of oil-CuO NF in a parabolic trough collector equipped with turbulators. They found that using the combination of NF and turbulator causes a 1.54% thermal efficiency improvement. Nakhchi and Esfahani <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> inspected the efficacy of aqueous Cu NF inside a heated tube equipped with the perforated conical rings in a turbulent regime. It was reported that using compound NF and turbulator results in considerable heat transfer intensification. Akyurek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> experimentally evaluated the forced convection flow of water-Al 2 O 3 NF inside a horizontal tube equipped with a wire coil turbulator. They utilized two turbulators with different pitches and found that the performance metrics of a tube filled with NF without any turbulator are superior to that of the cases with turbulator. Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> simulated the efficacy of aqueous CuO NF flowing inside a tube having a compound turbulator. The outcomes portrayed that using turbulator elevates the rate of heat exchange between tube wall and NF. Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> numerically investigated the forced convection of NF through a pipe equipped with a complex-shaped turbulator. They inspected the consequence of elevating width ratio, flow rate, and pitch ratio on the performance features. It was found that the Nusselt number intensifies with boosting pitch ratio of turbulator. In a numerical investigation, Ahmed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> explored the forced convection of water-Al 2 O 3 and water-CuO NFs inside a triangular duct with a delta-winglet pair of turbulator under a turbulent flow regime. They reported the significant effect of using both NF and turbulator on the performance aspects. The design of a heat transfer system can be done both according to the first law and the second law of thermodynamics. If the first law applies, the system must have the highest overall hydrothermal performance, and if the second law applies, the system performance must have the least irreversibility. The efficacy of NF flow in turbulator-equipped thermal units has rarely been investigated from a second-law perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> . Sheikholeslami et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> inspected the irreversibility features of turbulent flow of aqueous CuO NF inside a pipe equipped with complex turbulators. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> simulated the NF irreversibility in a tube with helically twisted tapes. The thermal irreversibility was found to be declined with elevating the height ratio of turbulator, while the opposite was true for the frictional irreversibility. Farshad and Sheikholeslami <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> analyzed the irreversibility aspects for aqueous Al 2 O 3 NF flow in a solar collector having a twisted tape. The outcomes revealed that the irreversibility diminishes with the increase of diameter ratio. Al-Rashed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> examined the influence of nanomaterial type on the irreversibility production of an NF in a heat exchanger. It was reported that the maximum irreversibility belongs to the platelet shape nanomaterials.</p><p>This numerical work aims to evaluate the features of turbulent flow of water-CuO NF through a hairpin heat exchanger equipped with helical baffles in the annulus side from both the first and second-law perspectives. The</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R E T R A C T E D A R T I C L E</formula><p>impacts of B , Re , and ϕ on the NF efficacy are assessed. This investigation is the first work on the consequences of using a helical baffle on the irreversibility production inside the annulus of a hairpin heat exchanger filled with NF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem statement</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> gives a demonstrative sketch of the geometry under investigation. It is a hairpin heat exchanger with 100 mm length, 10 mm inner tube internal diameter, and 15 mm outer diameter internal diameter. Additionally, the wall thickness for both the inner and outer tubes is 1 mm. Moreover, the considered B values are 25 mm, 33 mm, 50 mm, and 100 mm. The purpose of using this device is to cool the water-CuO NF passing through the annulus with the help of water passing through the inner tube. In both water and NF streams, time is of the essence and both streams are in a turbulent regime. Both streams enter the device at a uniform velocity and temperature and are discharged into the atmosphere and as a result, the relative pressure at the outlets is zero. Also, the exterior wall of the heat exchanger is considered insulated and the no-slip condition is utilized on the walls.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>The main focus of this numerical investigation is to analyze the turbulent flow of water-CuO NF inside a hairpin heat exchanger with the helical baffle on the annulus side. The effects of ϕ (0-4%), Re (5000-10,000), and B (25-100 mm) on the performance metrics are investigated. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> depicts the contour plots of NF velocity and temperature for different values of B at Re = 5000 and ϕ = 4% . It is seen that as B augments, the NF veloc- ity diminishes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> gives the consequences of elevating Re on the velocity and temperature contours of NF for B=25 mm. As is seen, intensifying the Re entails an elevation in the NF velocity and a decrement in the NF temperature.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> gives the Nusselt number in terms of B for various ϕ . The Nusselt number improves by elevating both the Re and ϕ , while it declines by augmenting the B . For instance, at Re = 5000 and ϕ = 0% , elevating the B from 25 to 100 mm results in a 19.05% decrease in the Nusselt number of NF, while this amount for ϕ = 4% is 15.62%. In addition, at B=25 mm and ϕ = 4% , intensification of Re from 5000 to 10,000 causes a 61.83% decline in the Nusselt number of NF. Elevating the Re entails a rise in the thickness of the velocity and thermal boundary layer, which elevates the temperature gradient and, consequently, elevates the convective heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number. Moreover, intensification of ϕ causes augmentation in the k nf and, thereby, an augmentation in the convective heat transfer and Nusselt number. Furthermore, intensifying the baffle pitch entails a decrease in the NF velocity and, therefore, a decrease in the convective heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number.</p><p>One of the important issues when choosing a working fluid is that the fluid performance should be examined from both the heat transfer and pressure drop (pumping power) aspects. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> gives the variations of the pressure drop of NF versus ϕ and B for different Re . It is observed that the pressure drop intensifies by boosting both the ϕ and Re , while it reduces by boosting the B . For example, at Re = 5000 and ϕ = 0% , boosting the B from 25 to 100 mm results in a 73.59% reduction in the pressure drop of NF, while this amount for ϕ = 4% is 73.55%.  according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>), the pressure drop of NF elevates. On the other hand, elevating the B causes an increment in the annulus fluid path and, as a result, an elevation in the pressure drop, while the NF velocity declines by boosting the B which results in a decrease in the pressure drop of NF. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded the effect of elevated annulus flow path on the pressure drop outweighs the effect of decreased NF velocity and, therefore, the NF pressure drop reduces with an elevation in the B.</p><p>The results presented so far have shown that intensifying the ϕ entails an elevated Nusselt number and pres- sure drop, which the first is a favorable effect and the latter is undesirable. For the final decision on the usefulness of using NF in the heat exchanger under investigation, the performance index should be examined. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> demonstrates the variations of the performance index versus ϕ and B for different Re values. The outcomes reveal that the hydrodynamic performance of the water-CuO NF in the considered heat exchanger is superior to that of the pure water in just the following four cases:</p><p>• B = 100 mm, ϕ = 4% and Re = 5000 where η = 1.029.</p><p>• B = 33.3 mm, ϕ = 2% and Re = 10000 where η = 1.067.</p><p>• B = 33.3 mm, ϕ = 4% and Re = 10000 where η = 1.054.</p><p>• B = 100 mm, ϕ = 2% and Re = 10000 where η = 1.000.</p><p>In the remainder of this section, the flow of water-CuO NF with ϕ = 2% in the considered heat exchanger is examined from the perspective of irreversibility production. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> displays the influences of Re and B on the frictional irreversibility of NF. As can be seen, the frictional irreversibility declines and rises with increasing B and Re , respectively, and the Re effect on the frictional irreversibility at lower B is greater. For example, at Re = 5000 , increasing the B from 25 to 100 mm results in a 67.84% decrease in frictional irreversibility. In addition, at B = 100 mm, the augmentation of Re from 5000 to 10,000 causes a 209.45% increment in the fric- tional irreversibility. By boosting the Re at a constant ϕ (i.e. constant Prandtl number) and B , the thickness of the velocity boundary layer decreases, which results in an elevated velocity gradient and thus elevated frictional irreversibility. On the other hand, increasing the Re at a constant ϕ and B , results in an elevated NF velocity and hence a decrease in the average NF temperature which results in elevated frictional irreversibility. Elevating the B results in a decrease in the flow mixing, which results in a decrease in the velocity gradient and a decrease in the NF temperature, which in turn decreases and elevates the frictional irreversibility. It can be concluded that the decreasing effect of velocity gradient on the frictional irreversibility is overcome by the increasing effect of NF temperature and, therefore, the frictional irreversibility decreases with increasing B. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> gives the changes of thermal irreversibility of NF with ϕ = 2% versus B in terms of Re . It is seen that the thermal irreversibility declines with the elevation of Re . For example, at B = 100 mm, the intensification of Re from 5000 to 10,000 causes a 52.57% decrease in thermal irreversibility. As mentioned before, the NF tem- perature decreases with increasing Re at a constant ϕ and B , which results in elevated thermal irreversibility. Also, the augmentation of Re results in improved mixing of the flow and consequently, a decrease in the temperature gradient which ultimately results in a decrease in the thermal irreversibility. It can be said that the impact of temperature gradient on the thermal irreversibility outweighs the impact of NF temperature and therefore, the thermal irreversibility declines with the rise of Re . Moreover, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> shows that with the rise of B at a constant Re and ϕ , the thermal irreversibility first elevates and then reduces. The highest thermal irreversibility occurs at B=50 mm. Boosting of B at a constant ϕ and Re reduces the flow mixing which results in the decrease of both the NF temperature and temperature gradient which respectively elevates and diminishes the rate of thermal irreversibility. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> reveals that for the B lower than 50 mm, the increasing impact of temperature outweighs the decreasing of the temperature gradient, and ultimately, the thermal irreversibility declines while the opposite is true for the B higher than 50 mm. The results presented in Figs. 9 and 10 show that increasing the baffle pitch results in a decrease in both the thermal and frictional irreversibilities, and therefore, it can be easily deduced that increasing the B entails a declined total irreversibility. However, the influence of Re on the total irreversibility cannot be predicted because the thermal irreversibility elevates with decreasing Re and then decreases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this study, the first law and the second law of thermodynamics are employed to investigate the turbulent flow of aqueous CuO NF through a hairpin heat exchanger equipped with the helical baffle on the annulus side. The influence of Re (5000-10,000), ϕ (0-4%), and B (25-100 mm) on the performance metrics are assessed. The fol- lowing results can be deduced from this simulation:</p><p>• With the rise of B at a constant Re and ϕ , the thermal irreversibility first elevates and then reduces.</p><p>• Intensifying the Re entails an elevated NF velocity and a declined NF temperature.</p><p>• Pressure drop intensifies by boosting both the ϕ and Re , while it reduces by boosting the B.</p><p>• Frictional irreversibility declines and rises with increasing B and Re , respectively.</p><p>• Re effect on the frictional irreversibility at lower B is greater.</p><p>In future studies, the effect of using perforated and porous turbulators on the results presented in the present study will be investigated.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>S tot = S gen dv Bejan number 49 : (a) =25 mm (b) =33 mm (c) =50 mm (d) = 100 mm (e) 2-D view (c) =50 mm</figDesc></figure>
