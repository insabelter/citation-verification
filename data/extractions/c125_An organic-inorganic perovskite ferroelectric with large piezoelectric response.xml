<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Molecular piezoelectrics are highly desirable for their easy and environment-friendly processing, light weight, low processing temperature, and mechanical flexibility. However, although 136 years have passed since the discovery in 1880 of the piezoelectric effect, molecular piezoelectrics with a piezoelectric coefficient d 33 comparable with piezoceramics such as barium titanate (BTO; ~190 picocoulombs per newton) have not been found. We show that trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese(II), an organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric crystal processed from aqueous solution, has a large d 33 of 185 picocoulombs per newton and a high phase-transition temperature of 406 kelvin (K) (16 K above that of BTO). This makes it a competitive candidate for medical, micromechanical, and biomechanical applications. P iezoelectricity arises in crystalline materials without inversion symmetry, allowing interconversion between electric voltage and mechanical stress. This property makes piezoelectrics essential for high-voltage sources, sensors, actuators, frequency standard, motors, vibration reducer, and other applications. Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie were brothers who discovered piezoelectricity in 1880 (1). The Curies used tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt to demonstrate the electromechanical interactions. Those first few piezoelectric materials have very weak piezoelectric performance, with piezoelectric coefficients of d 33 &lt; 10 pC/N (2). Among these piezoelectric materials, Rochelle salt is also a ferroelectric material, discovered in 1920 by Valasek (3). Ferroelectrics feature a switchable spontaneous electric polarization and usually also have good piezoelectric performance. The most widely used piezoelectric materials currently are ferroelectric ceramics such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and barium titanate (BTO), which have excellent elec-RESEARCH</p></div>

In our previous work, we reported the largest bulk d 33 among molecular ferroelectrics in imidazolium perchlorate (41 pC/N), yet it is only one-fifth of that of single-crystal BTO (d 33 = 90 and 190 pC/N along [001] and <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref> crystal orientation, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>. Imidazolium perchlorate has an even smaller d 33 than that of binary solid solutions such as PZT, which are as high as thousands of picocoulombs per newton with proper doping and phase engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Other organic materials have even weaker d 33 , with ~20 pC/N for polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), 2 pC/N for nylon, 11 pC/N for diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), and 5 pC/N for croconic acid.</p><p>Recent developments show the potential applications of organic-inorganic perovskite materials in electronics ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), light sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, photovoltaics <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>, and even ferroelectrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Because of their distinct structure, hybrid materials combine the benefits of organic molecules and advantageous characteristics of crystalline inorganic solids at a molecular level. We report the discovery of a single-phase organic-inorganic perovskite piezoelectric of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese(II) [Me 3 NCH 2 ClMnCl 3 , (TMCM-MnCl 3 )] that exhibits a piezoelectric coefficient on August 18, 2017 <ref type="url" target="http://science.sciencemag.org/">http://science.sciencemag.org/</ref> d 33 of 185 pC/N. Such a large d 33 makes TMCM-MnCl 3 a molecular material with a piezoelectric coefficient comparable with that of piezoelectric ceramics such as BaTiO 3 . TMCM-MnCl 3 is also a high-temperature molecular ferroelectric with a T c of 406 K (16 K above that of BTO), making it attractive for practical applications. Unlike inorganic piezoceramics, which require hightemperature synthesis and a high-voltage poling process before applications, TMCM-MnCl 3 is synthesized at room temperature with a preferential macroscopic ferroelectric polarization, making it suitable for growing on low-melting-point flexible substrates and fully compatible with solutionbased large-area fabrication techniques. Moreover, the toxic-metal-free composition suggests that TMCM-MnCl 3 may be a great candidate for next-generation micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), flexible devices, wearable devices, medical implants, and nanogenerators.</p><p>We prepared large crystals of TMCM-MnCl 3 in aqueous solution at room temperature (2) (figs. S1 and S2). We determined the structure with x-ray diffraction (XRD) at different temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). The low-temperature phase (LTP) of TMCM-MnCl 3 obtained at room temperature belongs to the polar space group Cc (2). The crystal packing adopts the BaNiO 3 -like perovskite structure, similar to several other molecular ferroelectrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. The Me 3 NCH 2 Cl cation is derived from the spherical tetramethylammonium cation by replacing a H atom with a Cl atom. Typically, three-dimensional molecules such as tetramethylammonium and damantane tend to exhibit dynamical disorder in close-packed crystals because of weak van der Waals interactions. As for TMCM-MnCl 3 , the Cl atom disturbs the spherical symmetry and thus induces the potential energy barrier to its tumbling motion. The high-temperature phase (HTP) is centrosymmetric, with the space group P6 3 /mmc. The relationship between the two lattice cells is a LTP ≈ -a HTP -b HTP , b LTP ≈ a HTP -b HTP , and c LTP ≈ c HTP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). We modeled the molecular tumbling with 12-fold orientational disorder (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). We found that in the HTP, only the N atom can be located from the difference Fourier map, indicating a strong dynamic characteristic of the molecular tumbling.</p><p>From the crystal structures of HTP and LTP, the phase-transition between these phases is induced by the order-disorder transition of the cations. In the paraelectric HTP, the crystal has a centrosymmetric structure because of the dynamic disorder of the organic cation. In the ferroelectric LTP, the crystal loses centrosymmetry because of the "freeze" of cations, which leads to the spontaneous polarization. We measured the temperature-dependent second-harmonic generation (SHG) response that supports the breaking of centrosymmetry (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). According to Aizu, this phase-transition of 6/mmmFm (Aizu notation) is one of the 88 species of ferroelectrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. We confirmed the ferroelectricity by observing the typical polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops using the double-wave method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and the Sawyer-Tower method (fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</p><p>We measured the saturate polarization (P s ) of 4.0 mC/cm 2 with both methods, which corresponded well with the calculated theoretical results (fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Such a polarization value is in the intermediate range among reported molecule-based ferroelectrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. We subjected a crystal of TMCM-MnCl 3 to polarization switching for up to 10 7 cycles, and it showed fatigue of &lt;10% (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</p><p>Steplike dielectric anomalies reveal the improper ferroelectric character of the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). We obtained a phase-transition temperature of T c = 406 K, which is consistent with the results from several temperature-dependent measurements (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). In such an improper ferroelectric compound, the Curie-Weiss law is not applicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. We also measured the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity and the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity (figs. S8 and S9). A simple model described by the Landau-Ginzburg theory can be applied to explain the behavior of dielectric permittivity around T c (fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><p>Ferroelectrics are naturally piezoelectrics because of the lack of an inversion center, but most organic materials have a very weak piezoelectric response. As one of the elements in the matrix of direct piezoelectric coefficient, d 33 represents the ability of a material to generate charges on the plane normal to the applied strain (eqs. S1 and S2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Because inorganic ferroelectrics are normally grown in the high-temperature paraelectric phase, they exhibit multidomain structures and require high-voltage poling processing before their application. Unlike inorganic ferroelectrics, crystals of TMCM-MnCl 3 are grown at room temperature and exhibit a nice monodomain structure (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>). To measure d 33 , we used a quasi-static method (also known as the Berlincourt method) on the as-grown single-crystal of TMCM-MnCl 3 .</p><p>In the temperature-dependent study, we obtained a maximum d 33 of 185 pC/N along the proximity of the [102] direction of the crystal in the LTP. For temperatures above T c , d 33 vanishes because of the restoration of centrosymmetry, which corresponds very well with the SHG data. We also tested the piezoresponse of TMCM-MnCl 3 with the frequency of driving force varying from 30 to 300 Hz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, inset), and this shows very little fluctuation (&lt;10 pC/N). For a direct comparison, we measured piezoelectric coefficients of a few piezoelectric materials and several molecular ferroelectrics under the same experimental conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> and table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). The results show that as a mono-composition ferroelectric, TMCM-MnCl 3 exhibits an abnormally large piezoelectric coefficient among undoped metal oxides and other molecular materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. omain walls or interaction between crystal grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Because we obtained the macroscopic d 33 on the as-grown single-crystalline monodomain sample, we expected the large d 33 to be intrinsic. To further confirm the large d 33 , we used a piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique, whose submicrometer spatial resolution allows us to probe the piezoresponse within a single domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. With the sample heated up and then cooled down from the HTP paraelectric phase, the polydomain state can be obtained (figs. S11 to S15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The typical PFM phase and amplitude images are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, respectively. The surface appeared as a beautiful lamellar multidomain structure. The local piezoresponse was then obtained on one of the single domains via extraction from the piezoresponse amplitude spectrum as a function of DC bias voltage, also known as a "butterfly" curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>, inset, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. Such local piezoresponses obtained from LiNbO 3 , triglycine sulfate (TGS), BTO, and TMCM-MnCl 3 were plotted as a function of macroscopic d 33 measured with the Berlincourt method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). A good linear relationship was observed. Because the local piezoresponse is proportional to the macroscopic d 33 , the prefactor for the dependence is related to the tip-sample geometry and other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, which are not in the scope of this work. From these local microscopic measurements, the observed large d 33 on TMCM-MnCl 3 can be well supported.</p><p>To explain the origin of such a large d 33 , we need to understand the structural properties of TMCM-MnCl 3 . In the binary system of PZT, which is a solid solution of PbZrO 3 and PbTiO 3 , a maximum d 33 &gt; 220 pC/N can be obtained at Zr/Ti = 0.52/0.48 by changing the relative composition of Zr. The large d 33 is attributed to the morphotropic phase boundary between tetragonal and rhombohedral phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. For the singlecomposition crystal of TMCM-MnCl 3 , the large d 33 is due to the organic-inorganic structure. Whereas the space group of the HTP of TMCM-MnCl 3 is P6 3 /mmc, the space group of LTP of TMCM-MnCl 3 is the nonmaximal subgroup Cc. In this case, compared with the HTP, TMCM-MnCl 3 loses more than one symmetry elements in the ferroelectric LTP, leading to the multipolaraxes characteristic, which is supported by the observation of lamellar domain structures and non-180°domain walls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). From crystallographic analysis and vector-PFM analysis (figs. S12 to S14) (2), there are six polar axes in TMCM-MnCl 3 , resulting in 12 different polarization directions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>, inset). Moreover, by examining the strain tensors in the LTP, TMCM-MnCl 3 is also a partially ferroelastic material <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>. Polarization states on the same polar axis, P i + and P i -(i = 1, 2,…, 6), belong to the same strain state S i (i = 1, 2,…, 6). Under an external stress, materials with ferroelasticity switch from one strain state to the other, which has been intensively studied in inorganic ferroelectrics, such as BTO and PZT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. In our case, when the external stress switches TMCM-MnCl 3 from S i to S j (i, j = 1, 2,…, 6), the polarization state is also switched from P i +/-to P j +/-(i, j = 1, 2,…, 6), respectively. Such rotation of polarization direction prompts an anomalously large change of the polarization, leading to the large piezoresponsivity.</p><p>Moreover, TMCM-MnCl 3 displays excellent photoluminescence properties, with a near-unity photoluminescence emission efficiency (figs. S16 to S18) (2). A thin-film sample of TMCM-MnCl 3 can also be prepared with large-area coverage and good uniformity by means of a simple dropcast method (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S19</ref>). The PFM characterization on domain structure and polarization reversal have also been carried out on thin-film of TMCM-MnCl 3 (figs. S20 to S23) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Because the large piezoelectricity is due to the particular structural property, more piezoelectrics may be formed by replacing Mn with other metals. For example, we synthesized a high-temperature molecular piezoelectric compound of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II) [Me 3 NCH 2 ClCdCl 3 (TMCM-CdCl 3 )] that has similarly attractive piezoelectric properties (figs. S24 to S27) (2).</p><p>We have discovered an organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric material of Me 3 NCH 2 ClMnCl 3 (TMCM-MnCl 3 ) that shows an excellent piezoelectric response (d 33 = 185 pC/N) that is close to that of inorganic piezoelectrics of BTO (d 33 = 190 pC/N) and a high transition temperature T c of 406 K. The room-temperature process avoids the high-temperature sintering and high-voltage poling process. Solution-based processing allows deposition of TMCM-MnCl 3 on various substrates, including flexible polymer, making it attractive for a variety of applications. Moreover, TMCM-MnCl 3 is an organic-inorganic material that can be further engineered through element substitution and molecular design so as to optimize for a desired physical property, as shown by demonstrations of bandgap engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Combining the outstanding piezoelectric properties and application advantages of molecular materials, we believe that this class of material has great potential for the next generation of MEMS, flexible devices, wearable devices, and bionics.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
