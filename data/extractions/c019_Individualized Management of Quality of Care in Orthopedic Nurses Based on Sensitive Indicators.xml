<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background. Sensitive indicators of nursing quality focus on the core elements of nursing quality management. Nursing-sensitive quality indicators will play an increasingly important role in the macro and micro management of nursing quality in my country.</p><p>Objective. This study were aimed at formulating the sensitive index management of orthopedic nursing quality based on individual nurses for improvement of the quality of orthopedic nursing. Methods. Based on the previous literature, the existing challenges in the early application of the orthopedic nursing quality evaluation index were summarized. Moreover, the management system of the orthopedic nursing quality-sensitive index based on individual nurses was devised and implemented, including monitoring the structure and result indices of individual nurses on duty and sampling the process indicators of patients managed by individual nurses. At the quarter-end, the data analysis was performed and fed back to determine the key points of the changes in the quality of specialized nursing affecting the individual, and the PDCA method was utilized for persistent improvement. The changes of sensitive indices of orthopedic nursing quality before (July-December 2018) and 6 months after implementation (July-December 2019) were compared. Results. There were significant differences in other indices (accuracy of limb blood circulation assessment/accuracy of pain assessment/postural care pass rate/accuracy of rehabilitation behavioral training/satisfaction of discharged patients) (P &lt; 0:05). Conclusion. The formulation of an individual-based orthopedic nursing quality-sensitive index management system modifies the traditional quality management model, improves the specialized nursing level, contributes to the accurate core competence training of specialized nursing, and improves the quality of specialized nursing of individual nurses. Consequently, there is an overall improvement in the specialized nursing quality of the department, and fine management is attained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The sensitive indicators of nursing quality are nursing guidelines, regulations, procedures and methods formulated according to the content, characteristics, processes, management requirements of nursing work, and the characteristics and needs of nursing staff. Sensitive indicators of nursing quality are also yardsticks for measuring nursing work. The establishment of a systematic, scientific, and advanced nursing standardization system is conducive to improving the quality of nursing and nursing management and promoting the development of nursing disciplines and the train-ing of nursing talents. On the basis of the above standards, each hospital formulates basic nursing quality standards, critically ill patient nursing quality standards, nursing documentation quality standards, and other standards but lacks specialist nursing quality standards. In the field of orthopedic nursing, domestic and foreign countries only focus on the evaluation of certain orthopedic diseases or individual nursing problems and lack comprehensive and overall orthopedic nursing quality standards. Sensitive indicators of nursing quality focus on the core elements of nursing quality management, and nursing-sensitive quality indicators will play an increasingly important role in the macro-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>and micromanagement of nursing quality in my country. Quantitatively identify nursing practices that are most relevant to patient outcomes in an effort to improve patient safety and quality of care <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>. The indicator management process includes data collection, quality control, data processing, and analysis, identifying key points of changes in nursing quality, selecting implementation measures, and improving program evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>.</p><p>Previously, indicator management was based on the integrity level of wards, departments, and hospitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>; however, the individualized management of nursing quality based on evaluation indicators has not yet been reported. At an early stage, the research team designed 10 sensitive indicators of orthopaedic care quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. The application process mainly includes the following: based on the challenges of data collation, data processing, and analysis at the ward level, the determination of the focus of complete change in nursing quality, and the relatively common selection of implementation measures and improvement projects; giving full play to the enthusiasm of nurses, leading to passive inspection and improvement is challenging; comparing quality differences among nurses is challenging and not conducive to performance appraisal. Considering the above challenges, we implemented individualized management of the nursing quality of orthopaedic nurses based on sensitive indicators and achieved satisfactory results. The research team constructed 10 sensitive indicators of orthopaedic nursing quality in the previous research. During the application process, it was found that there is no corresponding standard, which is likely to cause different scales of evaluators, lack of homogeneity, and insufficient conversion into specific nursing behaviors, in order to establish an intrinsic link between indicators and standards to drive continuous improvement in the quality of specialist care.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, the research team summarized the existing problems, searched domestic and foreign literature, and using the Delphi method formulated 10 orthopedic nursing quality sensitive indicators, such as limb blood circulation evaluation accuracy, posture nursing qualification rate, rehabilitation behavior training accuracy, and deep vein thrombosis incidence rate. The expert authority coefficient of two rounds of expert inquiry was 0.902. The results obtained were credible, with positive coefficients of 0.96 and 1.00. After two rounds of expert consultation, the coefficient of variation was 0-0.27, and the coefficient of coordination was 0.36-0.68 (P &lt; 0:05). Structural indicators (include 1.1 as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) were collected by daily registration, process indicators (2.1-2.4) by field assessment, and result indicators (3.1-3.4) by clinical data statistics (chart review) or satisfaction survey. Each index defines its connotation, evaluation elements, and calculation formula, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The evaluation criteria of specialized nursing quality were established, such as limb blood circulation, nerve function, axis turnover operation, plaster fixation patient care operation, spinal cord injury patient handling standards, and various auxiliary equipment use standards according to the indicators.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Implementation of Personalized Management of Orthopedic Nurses' Nursing Quality Based</head><p>(1) Establishment of a Specialist Nursing Quality Control Group. In January 2019, a specialist nursing quality control group was established. The group members comprised the department nursing director, district nursing director, and specialist nurses, with a total of 10 members. The inclusion criteria for team members were bachelor degree or above; rigorous scientific fact-finding attitude; rich nursing expertise, strong thinking, and judgment; experience in nursing quality evaluation; 10 or more years of experience in orthopedic nursing or management; and intermediate level or above. The responsibilities of the team members include organizing core competency training based on sensitive indicators and performing individual nursing quality personalized management (data collection, quality control, data processing and analysis, data feedback, and improvement project evaluation) for individual nurses based on sensitive indicators. (3) The Specialist Nursing Quality Control Team Performing Individualized Monitoring and Improvement of Indicators. Individualized monitoring of structural indicators (nursepatient ratio) and some outcome indicators (incidence of external fixation complications, deep vein thrombosis, and respiratory obstruction in high-risk patients) are conducted, that is, monitoring the nurse-patient ratio and outcome indicators during the shift of the responsible nurse. Patients who were under the charge nurse's supervision throughout the hospital stay were monitored for outcome indicators (patient satisfaction at discharge). To investigate satisfaction, the hospital's revised "Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire" was distributed at the time of discharge, which included patient satisfaction with the medical environment, quality of care, professional skills of nurses, and service attitude of nurses. The survey forms were placed in the satisfaction survey box by patients or family members to reduce human interference factors. The process indicators including accuracy of blood circulation assessment in limbs, the accuracy of neurological function assessment, the accuracy of pain assessment, the passing rate of postural care, and accuracy of rehabilitation behavior training of the patients under the charge of this responsible nurse were sampled, and record forms were filled out. Moreover, members of the quality </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>control team served as quality inspectors, and each nurse was continuously sampled for each indicator five times/ quarter, and the total number of times each nurse sampled for the five indicators was 25 per quarter. The quality of the nurses' process of implementing specialized care was assessed to determine if the content was comprehensive, the method was correct, and the results were consistent with the quality inspector's evaluation. When the two evaluation results were inconsistent, another quality inspector made a judgment, and if necessary, the competent professor of the patient was asked to implement the evaluation and provide guidance.</p><p>Quarterly data entry of quality evaluation was performed to establish a database of sensitive indicators of orthopedic nursing quality based on individual nurses. At the end of each quarter, the quality management team analyzed the above data by calculating each nurse's indicator value, comparing the growth rate of each nurse's indicator value to the previous quarter, comparing the difference in indicator values between nurses at the same level of position, comparing the difference between each nurse's indicator value and the indicator target value for nurses in the same level of position, and providing feedback to the individual nurse on the results of the analysis and the individual finding the impact of individual specialty nursing The results of the analysis are fed back to the individual nurse, and the individual identifies priorities for continuous improvement that affect individual specialty care changes. Simultaneously, targeted training is provided at the ward and unit level for nurses with large differences in indicator values and fluctuating indicator values, and specialty nursing core competency training is implemented based on individual nurses. For example, the pain assessment accuracy of a nurse's patients was the lowest among the process indicators and lower than the pain assessment accuracy of nurses in the same level of positions. The individual detected that the reasons affecting his low pain assessment accuracy were his lack of mastery of the use of different pain assessment scales, subjective judgment during pain assessment, and lack of timely assessment after implementing pain interventions. The individual proposed improvement measures, including changing the concept of pain, believing in the patient's chief complaint, learning relevant knowledge, and writing a case report on pain assessment in conjunction with the case; asking the district nurse manager or pain specialist nurse for bedside guidance; and self-evaluating the accuracy of pain assessment and comparing it with the evaluation results of the QI officer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Statistical Analysis.</head><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software to compare changes in orthopedic nursing quality sensitivity indicators before implementation (July-December 2018) and 6 months after implementation (July-December 2019). Percentages were used for descriptive analysis and the χ 2 test was used to compare the differences between the two groups with a test level of α = 0:05. The types of diseases in which nurses performed care before and after implementation included extremity fractures, mul-tiple injuries, pelvic fractures, brachial plexus injuries, hand trauma, osteoarthritis of the knee, femoral head necrosis, femoral neck fractures, femoral trochanter fractures, knee ligament injuries, knee meniscal injuries, lumbar disc herniation, cervical spondylosis, scoliosis, spinal cord injury, spinal fracture, extremity bone tumor, and sacral tumor. The differences in patients' sex, age, diagnosis, surgery, and condition classification were comparable and not statistically significant (P &gt; 0:05). The results of the discharge patient satisfaction survey were selected for statistical analysis from the questionnaires completed by patients who had implemented the process index evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>There was no significant difference in the nurse-patient ratio of nurses in charge of the same post before and after the intervention (P &gt; 0:05). The incidence of external fixation complications in high-risk patients was 0.65%, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0.52%, and the incidence of respiratory obstruction was 0.13%. In high-risk patients, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0.13% and the incidence of respiratory obstruction was 0. Comparing the process indicators of nurse management at different levels with the results of patient discharge satisfaction, all indicators except the accuracy rate of neurological function assessment of patients in the nursing management of level 3 and the satisfaction rate of discharged patients from nursing group leaders or specialist nurses have statistics difference in science (P &lt; 0:05).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>With the gradual formation of a consensus on the concept of "evidence-led improvement to replace evidence-based management," nursing-sensitive quality indicators will play an increasingly important role in the macro-and micromanagement of nursing quality in my country <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. In recent years, researches on nursing-sensitive quality indicators have appeared one after another in my country, but the application of indicators is single, and most of them are based on the three-level quality control of nursing departmentdepartment-department and head nurse <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Individuals "do not know what the challenge is, do not know if the problem is related to the individual, do not know what my quality level is" and a series of confusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. According to the epistemology of Marxism, the internal cause is the basis of change, the external cause is the condition of the change, and the external cause works through the internal cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Quality is prepared by individual nurses, and continuous improvement of quality is a process of active learning and improvement, rather than a process of passive improvement by individual nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. The results show that the index management based on individual nurses can timely feedback the quality level of nurses to individual nurses, making the quality evaluation more scientific and accurate; based on the index evaluation of individual nurses, the index results of all nurses in a certain period of time are summarized to form the overall quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.

This avoids the quality deviation that may be caused by unreasonable quality monitoring in the past, truly reflects the overall quality level, and is conducive to continuous quality improvement at the professional level.</p><p>Our study found no statistically significant difference in the proportion of nurses and patients in the same post before and after the intervention. The incidence of external </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>fixation complications in high-risk patients was 0.65%, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0.52%, and the incidence of respiratory obstruction was 0.13%. In high-risk patients, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0.13% and the incidence of respiratory obstruction was 0. The reason for the analysis is as follows: Because of the relatively stable nurse-to-patient ratio, the level of professional care in the department is reflected in the difference between the quality of the process and the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The evaluation of the professional nursing level before implementation is based on the overall professional level, from which it is found that the quality level of a certain nurse at a certain point in time is often fragmented and one-sided; after implementation, it can be comprehensive from individual nurses to the entire nurse system, reflecting the level of professional nursing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Sensitive indicators of orthopaedic nursing quality, such as the accuracy rate of limb blood circulation assessment, the accuracy rate of neurological function assessment, the qualified rate of posture nursing, and the accuracy rate of rehabilitation behavior training, involve the whole process of orthopaedic specialist nursing, and have complex, diverse, and variable characteristics. There were no statistically significant differences in the accuracy of neurological assessments among nurse-managed patients across the three levels of positions, indicating the challenges of accurate neurological assessments and the lack of accurate identification of high-risk patients with preexisting or potential neurological impairments by nurses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Preexisting nerve injury usually occurs by cutting, pulling, and pinching; underlying nerve injury usually occurs as a result of hematoma compression, displacement of internal fixation, and complications of therapeutic procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Nurses are often unable to actively observe and predict conditions, resulting in failed assessments. Thus, the goal of accurate assessment can be achieved by actively seeking clues, inquiring and making judgments, enhancing medical and nursing communication, and familiarizing with the cause of injury, surgery, and condition by responsible nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. The results show that continuous quality monitoring based on individual nurses can standardize nursing behavior and improve nurse compliance, thereby improving efficiency and quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. To sum up, the value of sensitive indicators of orthopaedic nursing quality has gradually increased from primary and senior supervisor nurses to nursing team leaders and specialist nurses, and the level of qualifications, experience, knowledge, and skills has been continuously improved. Match workload, patient condition and nursing needs, and nurses' specialist care level <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. This will further improve the quality of specialist care by ensuring that nurses provide higher quality care for Charlinger and critically ill patients.</p><p>Our study found that when comparing the process indicators of nurse management at different levels with patient discharge satisfaction outcomes, all patients except for the accuracy of neurological function assessment and patient satisfaction at discharge from nursing group leaders or specialist nurses in level 3 nursing management All indicators were statistically different. The reasons for the analysis are as follows: the assessment and management of nursing qual-ity should be based on professional standards of nursing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Nursing professional standards are an important part of the core competency training of nursing professions. Research shows that the training and evaluation of core competence of orthopaedic specialist nursing mainly includes theoretical knowledge, professional lethality, and comprehensive practical skills. The training mostly adopts group lectures, operation demonstrations, business visits, and difficult case discussions. This is training and assessment implemented from the holistic level of the orthopaedic education profession, which is a common clinical approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. With the development of holistic nursing, responsible nursing, high-quality nursing, and evidence-based nursing, as well as the arrival of the era of precision medicine, the precise training of core competencies in specialist nursing is particularly urgent. The positioning of our precision training is that the training needs of nurses come from the evaluation of quality indicators. The quality inspectors monitor individual nurses with the accurate implementation of nursing professional standards as the yardstick. When the quality deviates from the standard, they immediately supervise and repeat the training to realize the core ability of accurate professional nursing. At the same time, the core competitive training of precision specialist nursing develops with the professional development. Nursing professional standards and corresponding operating procedures should be formulated and revised in a timely manner, professional core skills should be improved, nurses should be clearly instructed, and targeted training should be carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. After the completion of the design of the valve blood circulation observation ruler, the operation procedure of the flap blood circulation assessment was revised in time. After intensive training, the head nurse tested the nurse's mastery degree when assessing the accuracy of the limb blood circulation assessment, and immediately found a problem.</p><p>Based on individual nurses, this study implemented the management of sensitive indicators of orthopaedic nursing quality, and further explored the application value of sensitive indicators of specialized nursing quality. Facts have proved that both managers and individual nurses can accurately find the weak links in nursing according to the changes in the indicator data, thereby improving the professional nursing quality of individual nurses, thereby improving the overall professional nursing quality of the department, and achieving refinement. This study was limited to the orthopaedic ward in our hospital, and future research may include a multicenter study to further improve the management of sensitive indicators of orthopaedic care quality based on individual nurse practice.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 2 )</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Core Competency Training Based on Sensitive Indicators.
