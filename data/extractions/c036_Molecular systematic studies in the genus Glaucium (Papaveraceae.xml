<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Glaucium is mainly distributed from Atlantic Europe to Central Asia. The genus comprises two sections and 23 species: sect. Acropetala Mory with four species, four subspecies and two varieties and sect. Glaucium with 19 species, eight subspecies and 16 varieties. Species identification is fundamentally important within the fields of biology, biogeography, ecology and conservation. There are 10 species including 4 subspecies and 14 varieties of Glaucium in Iran. Taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus is highly complicated and controversial. The present study was done by use of phenetic analyses of morphological characters as well as Bayesian analyses of molecular data (ITS sequences) to illustrate the species relationships, taxonomic classification, monophyly versus paraphyly of the species in the genus Glaucium. We used ten Glaucium species for molecular studies, of which, nrDNA, ITS sequences were newly obtained for 7 species. The molecular analysis, based on successive reweighting by rescaled consistency index, revealed that Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods gave very similar results based on ITS dataset. In general, the present study revealed that the species could be differentiated by morphological characters. PCA and cluster analysis (Ward's method) carried out for morphological traits divided the Glaucium species in to two cluster. Phylogenetic relationships within Glaucium are known and ITSbased phylogenetic trees and morphological characters were in concordance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Biosystematics investigations in plants comprise different tasks as species delineation, population divergence, species relationships, date of divergence determination, etc. Such data are not completed in majority of plant groups and one or few of these types of investigations have been performed in them. This holds true for the genus Glaucium (Papaveraceae).</p><p>Papaveraceae s. str. was formerly divided into four subfamilies: Chelidoniodeae Ernest, Eschscholzioideae Ernest, Papaveroideae <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ernest and</ref><ref type="bibr">Platystemonoideae Ernest (ERNEST, 1962-KADEREIT, 1993)</ref>. Later on, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">KADEREIT et al. (1994)</ref> included the subfamily of Platystemonoideae in Papaveroideae as well. The monophyly of two groups, Eschscholzioideae and Papaveroideae (including Platystemonoideae), was supported in phylogenetic analyses of Papaveraceae based on a combination of molecular and morphological data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">HOOT et al. (1997)</ref>. Glaucium Mill. and Dicranostigma Hook. f. et Thoms were also included as a part of Chelidonoideae while the morphological analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">KADEREIT et al. (1994)</ref> represented Glaucium and Dicranostigma as a sister group to Papaveroideae.</p><p>Glaucium is mainly distributed from Atlantic Europe to Central Asia <ref type="bibr">(KADERIET, 1993)</ref>. The genus comprises two sections and 23 species: sect. Acropetala Mory with four species, four subspecies and two varieties and sect. Glaucium with 19 species, eight subspecies and 16 varieties <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(MORY, 1979)</ref>. In Iran, it was represented by 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(CULLEN, 1966)</ref> to 13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(MOBAYEN, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">GRAN and SHARIFNIA, 2008)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">(1966)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">MORY (1979)</ref>, respectively. Mobayen reduced this species to the ranks of variety and subspecies <ref type="bibr">(1985)</ref>: G. flavum Crantz var. vitellinum (Boiss. &amp; Buhse) Mobayen and G. flavum subsp. vitellinum (Boiss. &amp; Buhse) Mobayen, while it was introduced as a distinct species by GRAN and SHARIFNIA <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>. G. leiocarpum Boiss. and G. elegans Fisch. &amp; C. A. Mey. var. integerrima Mobayen were placed as synonymous with G. flavum and G. elegans var. elegans, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(TAVAKKOLI, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Trichomes morphology and their frequency and distribution have shown that they provide valuable characters for delimitation of taxa at sectional level <ref type="bibr">(VAFADAR et al., 2010)</ref>. The structure and shape of trichomes are taxonomically significant for identification of Glaucium species as demonstrated by MORY <ref type="bibr">(1979)</ref>. Morphological description of the genus: Annual, biennial or perennial herbs. Stems with corymbose branches. Leaves lobed, pinnatifid or pinnatisect to pinnapartite and sometimes entire. Flowers solitary, axillary or terminal. Sepals 2, caduceus, with or without hair. Petals 4, yellow or orange, reddish orange, dark red, with or without spot. Stamens yellow or orange and numerous; anthers linear to oblong; filaments variable. Ovary linear, tuberculate, hairy or glabrous. Capsules siliquiform, linear to cylindrical, up to 28 cm long, with spongy septum, dehiscing by two valves. Stigma two lobed; lobes divergent, horizontal or curved. Seeds numerous, without appendages. The taxonomically most valuable characters in the genus are: the shape and cellular structure of trichomes on young fruits and sepals, the shape of stem leaves and filaments, the length of siliquae, anther and buds. Several taxonomic studies have shown that seed and trichome micromorphology can be useful for classification and delimitation of taxa at all taxonomic levels and in different plant families <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">KRAK and MRAZ, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">SALMAKI et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">SATIL et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">SALIMI MOGHADAM et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">TAVAKKOLI and ASSADI, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">ARABI et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, the seed ornamentations of 14 Glaucium taxa in Iran were investigated by GRAN and SHARIFNIA <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>. Seeds and trichomes of 15 taxa of the genus Glaucium distributed in Iran were examined by light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TAVAKKOLI and ASSADI, 2019). According to <ref type="bibr">ARABI et al. (2017)</ref> Glaucium taxa were investigated in terms of their morphological, palynological and phylogenetical characteristic. Their results show differences between the taxa in some of these characteristics, especially in micromorphology and formation of clades in phylogenetic trees based on the matK and ITS3-6 DNA sequence data. Based on the findings of the molecular analyses supported by morphological data (stem's trichomes), the genus Glaucium of Turkey was divided into subsections Glabrousae and Pubescentae.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">BOGLER et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">GOBERT et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHANG et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2017c;</ref><ref type="bibr">2017d;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2018)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant materials</head><p>For morphometric studies (phonetic analyses) we used 15 plant specimens of 9 Glaucium species growing in Iran (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Fig1</ref>) and for nrDNA ITS phylogenetic tree 11 species (including 1 out-group species Papaver somniferum L.) were used. One of the collected samples did not match with descriptions in Flora of Iran and Flora of USSR, and it seems that the sample belongs to a new species of Glaucium from Iran. Therefore, we decide to definite it as G.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis Morphological studies</head><p>We used phenetic analyses for morphological data. For grouping of the plant specimens, UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) and Ward (Minimum spherical variance) as well as PCoA plot (Principal coordinate analysis) were used <ref type="bibr">(PODANI, 2000)</ref>.

Maximum parsimony (MP was used for cladistics analysis, followed by bootstrapping (100 times). PAST version 2.17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(HAMMER et al., 2012)</ref> and PAUP <ref type="bibr">(SWOFFORD, 2002)</ref> were used for these analyses. Both qualitative and quantitative features were applied for maximum parsimony analyses. For this purpose, quantitative features were coded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular analyses Species relationship by ITS sequences</head><p>Different phylogenetic methods were used to study the species relationship like Maximum parsimony (MP), Maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian approach. Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis was conducted using PAUP* <ref type="bibr">(SWOFFORD, 2002)</ref>. The heuristic search option was used for each of the two single region datasets, using tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, with 1,000 replicates of the random addition sequence. Uninformative characters were excluded from the analysis. Branch support values were calculated using a full heuristic search with 1,000 bootstrap replicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(FELSENSTEIN, 1985)</ref> each with a simple addition sequence. Combinability of these two datasets was assessed by use of the partition homogeneity test (the incongruence length difference test (ILD) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">FARRIS et al. (1995)</ref> as implemented in PAUP* <ref type="bibr">(SWOFFORD, 2002)</ref>. The test was conducted with invariant characters excluded (CUNNINGHAM, 1997) using the heuristic search option involving 100 replicates of the random addition sequence and TBR branch swapping with 1,000 homogeneity replicates. The maximum number of trees was set to 500. The model of sequence evolution for each dataset was selected by use of the software MrModeltest v. 2.3 <ref type="bibr">(NYLANDER, 2004)</ref> as implemented in MrMTgui <ref type="bibr">(NUIN, 2005)</ref> based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) <ref type="bibr">(POSADA and BACKLEY, 2004)</ref>. All datasets were analyzed as a single partition with the Kimura 2-parameters + G model by Bayesian inference (BI) using the software MrBayes version 3.12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(RONQUIST and HUELSENBECK, 2003)</ref>. Posteriors on the model parameters were estimated from the data, using the default priors. The analysis was performed with 4 million generations, using Markov chain Monte Carlo search. MrBayes performed two simultaneous analyses starting from different random trees (Nruns = 2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R E T R A C T E D</formula><p>each with four Markov Chains trees sampled every 100 generations. The first 25 % of trees were discarded as the burn-in. The remaining trees were then used to build a 50 % majority rule consensus tree accompanied by posterior probability (PP) values. Tree visualization was performed by use of Tree View version 1.6.6 (Page 2001).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphometry Species delimitation and inter-relationship</head><p>WARD clustering based on all collected sample (only few sample were used for drawing the figures to be brief and readable) separated plants of each species in a distinct cluster or groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Therefore, Glaucium species indigenous to Iran can be differentiated based on the studied morphological characters. Morphological characters used not only separated each subspecies but also could delineate the presumed species.</p><p>PCA analysis revealed that the first three factors comprised over 70% of the total variation. In the first PCA axis with 45% of total variance, morphological characters like peduncle and pedicel hair, stem hair, leaf hair, petiole hair, width of petal, had the highest correlation (&gt;0.7).</p></div>

The first major cluster contained two sub-clusters: plants of G. grandiflorum subsp. grandiflorum var. grandiflorum; G. grandiflorum subsp. grandiflorum var. iranicum; G. grandiflorum subsp. refractum; G. corniculatum var. corniculatum; G. golestanicum and G. corniculatum var. flaviflorum comprised the first cluster. The second major cluster also contained two sub-clusters, G. fimbrilligerum; G. flavum var. flavum; G. oxylobum var. oxylobum; G. contortuplicatum var. cantortuplicatum; G. flavum var. serpieri; G. elegans var elegans; G. calycinum var. calycinum and G. x(new) were placed close to each other due to morphological similarity.

Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods gave very similar results based on ITS dataset.

DISCUSSION Plant molecular studies enormously advanced in the recent years and molecular phylogenetic has dramatically reshaped our views of organismal relationships and evolution at all taxonomic levels of the hierarchy of life, from the species level (and below) to kingdoms (and above). This revised concepts of relationship based on phylogenetic analyses are also resulting in revised classifications in many groups of plants. However, we are aware that reliance on a single data set may result in insufficient resolution or an erroneous picture of phylogenetic relationships. As a result, it is now common practice to use multiple data sets (preferably both molecular and non-molecular) for phylogenetic inference <ref type="bibr">(SOLTIS and SOLTIS, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">GHOLAMIN and KHAYATNEZHAD, 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2020b</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2020c;</ref><ref type="bibr">JI et al, 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">WANG et al, 2020)</ref>. However, though multiple data sets are needed for estimating phylogenetic relationships reliably, different genes may possess different histories and the phylogenetic trees they construct may not picture the true relationships and different orthologous genes may often yield strongly supported but incompatible tree topologies.</p><p>The three primary causes of incongruence in tree topologies are gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and deep coalescence, which have varying levels of importance depending on the Three alternatives have been proposed for handling multiple data sets in phylogenetic analyses: the combined approach, the consensus approach, and the conditional combination approach. Conditional combination involves combining data except in those instances in which significant heterogeneity exists between data sets and that heterogeneity appears to be attributable to different branching histories <ref type="bibr">(SOLTIS and SOLTIS, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MA et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">PENG et al,, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">SI et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">SUN et al., 2021)</ref>. For this reason, many have suggested different statistical test for phylogenetic trees congruence (see for example, FOULDS and ROBINSON, 1981). However, several authors believe that statistical tests for congruence may not provide a definitive answer as to whether it is appropriate to combine data sets. That is, even if congruence tests reveal some low level of heterogeneity between data sets, the investigator may be justified in combining data sets <ref type="bibr">(SUN and KHAYATNEZHAD 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">TAO et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">WANG et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">XU et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">YIN et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">ZHANG et al, 2021 )</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R E T R A C T E D</formula><p>Multispecies coalescent (MSC) approaches (e.g. DEGNAN and ROSENBERG, 2009; KUBATKO and <ref type="bibr">DEGNAN, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHU et al, 2021)</ref> are now considered state-ofthe-art in estimating a species tree from a set of gene alignments. Recent advances now allow for the simultaneous estimation of gene phylogenies, the MSC species phylogeny, and ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) of particular characters of interest, such as geographical of morphological evolution <ref type="bibr">(BOUCKAERT et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>We found morphological taxonomic identification was often congruent with nrDNA markers. The species relationships obtained in ITS-based tree are also in agreement with morphological tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systematic implications and evolutionary aspects of morphological characters</head><p>WARD clustering of morphological characters separated each species, this is in agreement with phylogenetic analysis by using ITS sequences. This study documents the occurrence of 9 species and 11 varieties belonging to the genus Glaucium that have been found in Iran. The taxonomically most valuable characters in the genus are: the shape and cellular structure of trichomes on young fruits and sepals, the shape of stem leaves and filaments, the length of siliquae, anther and buds (Tab. 2).</p><p>G. corniculatum subsp. refractum (Nab.) Cullen with refracted fruiting pedicels and contorted siliquae was reported from western Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(CULLEN, 1966)</ref>. One of the diagnostic characteristics of G. corniculatum is fruiting pedicels that are shorter than their subtended leaves while a reported specimen in Flora Iranica (Farahbakhsh 5956; deposited in IRAN herbarium) has fruiting pedicels longer than their subtended leaves as G. grandiflorum. Hence, similar to Mory's view, G. grandiflorum subsp. refractum (Nab.) Mory is used.</p><p>The main characteristics of G. oxylobum have been reported to be: ovaries tuberculatepapilate and petals yellow <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(CULLEN, 1966)</ref>; ovaries (young siliquae) with tubercles narrowed at the apex and petals dark red to violet (BOISSIER, 1867); ovaries with conical hairs and petals pale red with black basal spot <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(MORY, 1979)</ref>.</p></div>

We agree with PARSA (1986) regard G. paucilobum as a variety of G. oxylobum.</p><p>Diagnostic characteristics of G. fimbrilligerum Traut &amp; Buhse are maculate orange petals and sepals with the length of 20 mm long and they possess long and adpressed hairs on the siliquae <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(CULLEN, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr">Khayatnezhad, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Gholamin , 2021a, 2021b)</ref>. A detailed examination of the species G. fimbrilligerum (deposited in W herbarium-No. ooo4645-Afghanistan: Chord Kabol, 2070 m, 6. 8. 1951, Gilli 866) with a particular focus on the trichome cellular structure of young siliquae, provides strong support for the proposal that this species has not been found in Iran so far <ref type="bibr">(TAVAKKOLI and ASSADI, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>G. elegans var. integerrima Mobayen was repo-rted from NW Iran based on dentate or lobed leaves and yellow and pink petals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(MOBAYEN, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">KARASAKAL et al, 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr">KARASAKAL et al, , 2020b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">HUANG et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">HOU et al, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, GUO et al, 2021)</ref>. G. elegans was reported by CULLEN <ref type="bibr">(1966)</ref>, POPOV <ref type="bibr">(1937)</ref> and FEDDE <ref type="bibr">(1909)</ref> for having pinatifid or pinnatisect radical leaves; the stem leaves nearly ovate, sinuate to dentate or rarely entire and having yellow petals, red in the middle part and with black basal spot. Among specimens studied, some were observed which had lobed or pinnatisect to pinnapartite basal and stem leaves. Some specimens also had lobed or dentate stem leaves and pinnatisect basal leaves. Their petals were yellow to orange (with black basal spot) in fresh stage but pinkish in dry stage. Therefore, the separation of var. integerrima from the type variety cannot be justified.</p><p>During the taxonomic revision of the genus Glaucium, G. contortuplicatum var. hirsutum is described as a new variety (TAVAKKOLI and ASSADI, 2019; Ren and Khayatnezhad 2021; KHAYATNEZHAD and NASEHI <ref type="bibr">2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, I et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">JIA et al, 2021)</ref>. This taxon differs from the type variety by having dense and appressed trichomes all along ovary (or junior silique). Leaf epidermis micro-characters of these two taxa are also compared. G. leiocarpum and G. elegans var. integerrima are reduced to synonymy of G. flavum and G. elegans var. elegans, respectively. Additionally, morphological characters and geographical distribution of the taxa studied in the world and in Iran are presented. </p></div>

Izvod Glaucium uglavnom je distribuiran iz Atlantske Evrope u centralnu Aziju. Rod se sastoji od dva dela i 23 vrste: sect. Acropetala Mori sa četiri vrste, četiri podvrste i dve sorte i sec. Glaucium sa 19 vrsta, osam podvrsta i 16 sorti. Identifikacija vrsta je fundamentalno važna u oblastima biologije, biogeografije, ekologije i konzervacije. U Iranu postoji 10 vrsta, uključujući 4 podvrste i 14 sorti Glaucium. Taksonomija i filogenija roda veoma su komplikovane i kontroverzne. Ovo istraživanje je urađeno korišćenjem morfoloških karakteristika, kao i Baiesovim analizama molekularnih podataka (ITS sekvence) radi ilustracije odnosa vrsta, taksonomske klasifikacije, monofilije naspram parafilije vrste u rodu Glaucium. Za molekularna istraživanja koristili smo deset vrsta Glaucium, od kojih su nrDNA, ITS sekvence novodobijene za 7 vrsta. Molekularna analiza, zasnovana na uzastopnom ponovnom ponderisanju indeksom konzistentne promene, otkrila je da su maksimalna oskudnost, maksimalna verovatnoća i Baiesove metode dale vrlo slične rezultate zasnovane na ITS skupu podataka. Generalno, ova studija je otkrila da se vrste mogu razlikovati po morfološkim karakteristikama. PCA i klaster analiza (Ward -ova metoda) sprovedena za morfološke osobine podelila je vrste Glaucium u dve grupe. Filogenetski odnosi unutar Glaucium su poznati, a filogenetska stabla zasnovana na ITS-u i morfološki karakteri bili su u skladu.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Received, September 28 th , 2020 Accepted August 28 th , 2021 ARABI, Z. et al.
