<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The state of protein phosphorylation can be a key determinant of cellular physiology such as early-stage cancer, but the development of phosphoproteins in biofluids for disease diagnosis remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a strategy to isolate and identify phosphoproteins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human plasma as potential markers to differentiate disease from healthy states. We identified close to 10,000 unique phosphopeptides in EVs isolated from small volumes of plasma samples. Using label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified 144 phosphoproteins in plasma EVs that are significantly higher in patients diagnosed with breast cancer compared with healthy controls. Several biomarkers were validated in individual patients using paralleled reaction monitoring for targeted quantitation. This study demonstrates that the development of phosphoproteins in plasma EV as disease biomarkers is highly feasible and may transform cancer screening and monitoring.</p><p>phosphoproteins | proteomics | extracellular vesicles | mass spectrometry | biomarker E arly diagnosis and monitoring of diseases such as cancers through blood tests has been a decades-long aim of medical diagnostics. Because protein phosphorylation is one of the most important and widespread molecular regulatory mechanisms that controls almost all aspects of cellular functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>, the status of phosphorylation events conceivably provides clues regarding disease status <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. However, few phosphoproteins have been developed as disease markers. Assays of phosphoproteins from tissues face tremendous challenges because of the invasive nature of tissue biopsy and the highly dynamic nature of protein phosphorylation during the typically long and complex procedure of tissue biopsy. Furthermore, biopsy tissue from tumors is not available for monitoring patient response over the course of treatment. Development of phosphoproteins as disease biomarkers from biofluids is even more challenging because of the presence of active phosphatases in high concentration in blood. With several highly abundant proteins representing more than 95% of the mass in blood, few phosphorylated proteins in plasma/serum can be identified with stable and detectable concentrations.</p><p>The recent discovery of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles and exosomes, and their potentially important cellular functions in tumor biology and metastasis has presented them as intriguing sources for biomarker discovery and disease diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Critical for immune regulation and intercellular communication, EVs have many differentiating characteristics of cancer cell-derived cargo, including mutations, active miRNAs, and signaling molecules with metastatic features <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. The growing body of functional studies has provided strong evidence that these EV-based disease markers can be identified well before the onset of symptoms or physiological detection of a tumor, making them a promising candidate for early-stage cancer and other diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>. Interestingly, EVs are membrane-encapsulated nano-or microparticles, which protects their inside contents from external proteases and other enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. These features make them highly stable in a biofluid for extended periods of time and also allow us to potentially develop phosphoproteins in EVs for medical diagnoses. The ability to detect the genome output (active proteins, and in particular phosphoproteins) can provide more direct real-time information about the organism's physiological functions and disease progression, particularly in cancers.</p><p>We aimed to develop EV phosphoproteins as potential disease markers by focusing on breast cancer in this study. With tremendous challenges facing mass spectrometry-based biomarker discovery using biofluids, identification of EV phosphoproteins presents a totally different path to disease diagnosis. To this end, we isolated and identified the largest group of EV phosphoproteins to date from both microvesicles and exosomes and measured phosphorylation changes across patients with breast cancer and healthy individuals. We subsequently identified multiple potential candidates and verified several among patients and healthy controls. The EV phosphoproteomics approach demonstrated here can be applied to other systems, and thus establish a strategy for biomarker discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p>Protein phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism for many cellular functions, but no phosphoprotein in biofluids has been developed for disease diagnosis because of the presence of active phosphatases. This study presents a general strategy to isolate and identify phosphoproteins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human plasma as potential markers to differentiate disease from healthy states. We identified close to 10,000 unique phosphopeptides in EVs from small volumes of plasma samples and more than 100 phosphoproteins in plasma EVs that are significantly higher in patients diagnosed with breast cancer as compared with healthy controls. This study demonstrates that the development of phosphoproteins in plasma EVs as disease biomarkers is highly feasible and may transform cancer screening and monitoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Identification of 9,643 Unique Phosphopeptides from Plasma Microvesicles and Exosomes. The workflow for the isolation of EVs, enrichment of phosphopeptides, and EV phosphoproteome analyses is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Microvesicles and exosomes were isolated from human plasma samples through high-speed and ultra-high-speed centrifugations, respectively, an approach that has been used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. For the initial screening, the plasma samples were collected and pooled from healthy individuals (n = 6) and from patients diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 18). After lysis of EVs, proteins were extracted and peptides generated using trypsin with the aid of phase-transfer surfactants for better digestion efficiency and fewer missed tryptic sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Phosphopeptides were enriched and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on a high-speed, high-resolution mass spectrometer. For each phosphopeptide sample, three technical replicates were performed. Label-free quantification was performed to determine differential phosphorylation of EV proteins in the plasma of control and breast cancer patient samples.</p><p>The strategy allowed us to identify 9,643 unique phosphopeptides, including 9,225 from microvesicles and 1,014 from exosomes, representing 1,934 and 479 phosphoproteins in microvesicles and exosomes, respectively. On average, close to 7,000 unique EV phosphopeptides were identified from 1 mL human plasma. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>, more than 50% of exosome phosphopeptides were also identified in microvesicles. Gene ontology analysis of the phosphoproteins indicated overall similar cellular components and biological functions between microvesicles and exosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>). Although previous large-scale phosphoproteomics studies revealed that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, a significant portion of the EV phosphoproteomes are distinctively from membranes and organelles. As expected, proteins annotated as extracellular were significantly overrepresented in the EV phosphoproteomes. We also found that many EV phosphoproteins are involved in cellcell communication, stimulus response, and biogenesis.</p><p>The EV phosphoproteome analyses revealed that the distribution of tyrosine, threonine, and serine phosphorylation (pY, pT and pS) sites is 2.0%, 14.1%, and 83.9%, respectively, for microvesicle phosphoproteins, which is similar to previously reported site distribution in in vivo human phosphoproteomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Interestingly, the distribution of pY in exosomes is an order of magnitude higher, at 13.7%, which is quite close to the distribution of pT, at 16.1% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). This apparent discrepancy may reflect the different origins of microvesicles and exosomes. Microvesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane, whereas exosomes are represented by endosome-associated proteins, in which proteins such as integrins, hormone receptors, growth factor receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src kinases are involved. A further motif analysis of pS/T phosphorylation sites revealed overall similar distribution of general motif to cellular phosphoproteome; for example, the most abundant class of sites is acidophilic, followed by proline-directed and basophilic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>). However, in the exosome phosphoproteome, proline-directed phosphorylation constitutes only half of that in microvesicles, and therefore the motif assay does not show dominant -SPmotif in the exosome phosphoproteome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</p><p>Cancer-Specific Phosphoproteins in EV. Label-free quantitation of phosphopeptides with the probability score of phosphorylation site location over 0.75 was used to identify differential phosphorylation events in patients with breast cancer from those in healthy individuals. We quantified 3,607 and 461 unique phosphosites and identified 156 and 271 phosphosites with significant changes [false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 and S0 = 0.2] in microvesicles and exosomes, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Differential phosphorylation may be a result of changes in protein expression or changes of a particular site's phosphorylation. To distinguish these factors, we also performed label-free quantitation of total proteomes for both microvesicles and exosomes. We identified 1,996 proteins, 34.4% of which were also identified with phosphopeptide enrichment. In comparison, 862 proteins were detected in the phosphorylation data alone, indicating that phosphoproteins are typically of low abundance, escaping detection via the shotgun proteomics approach. Quantitative analyses of EV proteomes revealed strikingly similar expression of most proteins in healthy individuals and patients with cancer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). In comparison, there are a larger number of phosphorylation sites with significant changes in patient samples, indicating that these phosphorylation differences between patients with cancer and healthy individuals are not a result of changes in protein expression, and thus reflect phosphorylation truly specific to patients with cancer. The result also justifies our approach to developing protein phosphorylation changes, instead of protein expression changes, as the measurement of disease progression. EV proteomic analyses also revealed that several protein markers were only identified in microvesicles or exosomes specifically, but at the same time, there are some protein markers identified in both particles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). Western blotting was carried out with the antibody against CD 31, which is considered an endothelialderived microvesicles marker. Although CD 31 was mainly identified in microvesicles, the Western blotting (WB) experiment and MS data indicated that the current isolation method based on ultracentrifugation is not entirely specific.</p><p>We compared these phosphosites representing 197 unique phosphopeptides that showed significant increase in patients with breast cancer with all identified unique phosphopeptides in EV phosphoproteomes (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). Again, the disparity of relative abundance of pY/pT/pS and sequence motif in microvesicle and exosomes may be a result of their different origins. Although phosphopeptides that showed a significant decrease in patients with breast cancer might be interesting, it is conceivable that these phosphopeptides were not necessarily down-regulated in EV pools, as EVs from other cell sources could compensate them. Therefore, we focused our attention on these 197 unique phosphopeptides. Motif analyses of the corresponding phosphosites found that proline-directed motif (s/tP) decreased significantly, whereas the AB motif increased. In terms of cellular components, the up-regulated phosphoproteins showed a slightly increased share of membrane proteins in MV, whereas there is increase in extracellular proteins in exosome. We further compared the 197 unique phosphopeptides with a recent comprehensive proteogenomic study in which breast phosphoproteomics studies were carried out in tissues from 105 patients with breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. We found that a significant portion of these 197 phosphopeptides (&gt;60%) were also identified by the proteogenomic study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), indicating that EV phosphoproteome is sensitive and that quantitative analyses of EV phosphoproteomics can identify phosphorylation events that are disease specific. However, because EVs can be released from diverse types of cells, the difference could be the result of distinctive immune response or other factors in healthy individuals and patients with cancer. Nevertheless, the results highlight the advantage of analyzing EV phosphoproteome through liquid biopsy over tissue biopsy, which is invasive and subject to variation because of the long procedure.</p><p>To better understand the biological roles of differential phosphorylation events, we examined phosphoproteins specific to patients with cancer, using STRING to identify enriched gene ontology categories and signaling networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. We found that several crucial functions related to cancer metastasis, membrane reorganization, and intercellular communication were enriched in cancer-specific EV phosphoproteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). It is interesting to reveal the central role of SRC tyrosine kinase with multiple phosphoproteins identified in the study, which is consistent with previous studies linking an elevated level of activity of SRC to cancer progression by promoting other signals. Please note that although 16% of phosphoproteins that were up-regulated in patients with cancer are membrane proteins, and because of relative lack of protein-protein interaction data with membrane proteins, these membrane proteins were not implicated in the STRING analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verification of Phosphorylation Specific to Patients with Cancer,</head><p>Using Parallel Reaction Monitoring. Because breast cancer is extremely heterogeneous, the chance to identify a single diagnostic biomarker is likely rare. Instead, the identification of a panel of candidate markers that reflect the onset and progression of key disease-related signaling events would be feasible to offer better prognostic value. In an effort to validate the differential phosphorylation of potential markers in patients with cancer, we applied parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> to quantify individual EV phosphopeptides in plasma from patients with breast cancer and healthy individuals. Because phosphospecific antibodies suitable for construction of ELISA are rarely available, targeted, quantitative MS approaches such as PRM and MRM (multireaction monitoring) are essential for initial validation. As a demonstration that PRM can be used to initially verify candidate phosphoproteins, we selected four phosphoproteins: Ral GTPase-activating protein subunit alpha-2 (RALGAPA2), cGMP-dependent protein kinase1 (PKG1), tight junction protein 2 (TJP2), and nuclear transcription factor, X box-binding protein 1 (NFX1). These four proteins showed significant phosphorylation up-regulation in patients with cancer, were previously reported as phosphoproteins, and have been implicated in multiple breast cancer studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>Quantitative assays based on PRM were performed with plasma EV samples from 13 patients with cancer (eight additional patient samples) and seven healthy controls (one additional control). The relative abundance data of phosphopeptides from four individual proteins are presented as a linear box-and-whiskers plot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). With reference from the figure, RALGAPA2, PKG1, and TJP2 were observed to be significantly elevated in patients with breast cancer compared with in control patients. However, the fold difference is noticeably smaller in PRM than label-free quantification. In particular, NFX1 phosphorylation was only identified in breast cancer samples, and not in healthy controls, but because of large variation among individual samples, the difference of NFX1 phosphorylation on the specific site is statistically inconclusive. The data may be the reflection of dynamic suppression of targeted proteomics such as MRM and PRM. Nevertheless, large variation among clinical samples underscores current challenges facing biomarker validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>MS-based proteomic profiling and quantitation holds enormous promise for uncovering biomarkers. However, successful applications to human diseases remain limited. This is, in large part, a result of the complexity of biofluids that have an extremely wide dynamic range and are typically dominated by a few highly abundant proteins. This prevents the development of a coherent, practical pipeline for systemic screening and validation. Here, we reported in-depth analyses of phosphoproteomes in plasma EVs and demonstrated the feasibility of developing phosphoproteins as potential disease biomarkers. Previous studies typically could only identify a small number of phosphoproteins in plasma, likely as a result of the presence of phosphatases in the bloodstream, and the level of phosphorylation does not have any clear meaningful connection to biological status <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>. We presented an MS-based strategy that includes the isolation of EV particles from human blood, enrichment of EV phosphopeptides, LC-MS/MS analyses, and PRM quantification for biomarker discovery and quantitative verification. We analyzed samples from patients with breast cancer, in comparison with healthy controls, to identify candidate breast cancer biomarkers. These candidates will need to be further evaluated in larger, heterogeneous patient cohorts of defined breast cancer subtypes in the future. The study highlights our ability to isolate and identify thousands of phosphopeptides from limited volumes of biobanked human plasma samples. These findings provide a proof of principle for this strategy to be used to explore existing resources for a wide range of diseases.</p><p>Recently, liquid biopsies (analysis of biofluids such as plasma and urine) have gained much attention for cancer research and clinical care, as they offer multiple advantages in clinical settings, including their noninvasive nature, a suitable sample source for longitudinal disease monitoring, better screenshot of tumor heterogeneity, and so on. Current liquid biopsies primarily focus on the detection and downstream analysis of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA. A major obstacle with the current methods is the heterogeneity and extreme rarity of the circulating tumor cells and circulating DNA. EVs offer all the same attractive advantages of a liquid biopsy, but without the sampling limitation of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA. At present, most of the studies on EVs focus on microRNAs and a small portion on EV proteins. The ability to detect the genome output, and in particular functional proteins such as phosphoproteins, can arguably provide more useful real-time information about the organism's physiological functions and disease progression, such as in the early detection and monitoring of cancers. Our study clearly indicates that EV phosphoproteomes can be readily captured and analyzed. It is interesting to know that EV phosphoproteins are stable over a long period of storage time (the plasma samples from Indiana Biobank were collected more than 5 y ago), which is critical for applications in clinical tests. However, a thorough investigation on EV phophoproteome stability might be necessary, as cellular phosphorylation events are extremely dynamic and EVs are circulating in the blood for long periods of time. EV phosphoproteomes may mainly represent phosphorylation events that are constitutively active, and therefore insensitive to capturing acute events. All these questions can be addressed with further studies on well-defined EV samples, possibly using animal models.</p><p>Last, although we present here a feasible strategy to develop phosphoproteins as potential disease markers, it relies on the isolation of a good quantity of EVs with high reproducibility. At this stage, the isolation of microvesicles and exosomes is primarily based on differential high-speed centrifugation, which is not highly specific and is unlikely suitable for clinical settings. Immunoprecipitation of microvesicles and exosomes may introduce bias and contaminations from plasma proteins. The development of phosphoproteins as biomarkers is also severely limited by the availability of phosphospecific antibodies. The inability to develop ELISA or similar immunobased assays will inevitably depend on alternative validation methods such as MSbased targeted quantitation and nonantibody-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. The complexity of biofluids and the necessity of including EV isolation and phosphopeptide isolation in a sample preparation will no doubt add extra challenges to the accuracy of MS-based targeted quantitation of heterogeneous clinical samples.</p></div>
