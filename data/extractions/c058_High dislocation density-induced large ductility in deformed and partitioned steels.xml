<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with high strength and ductility. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium Mn steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D&amp;P) process produced dislocation hardening, but retained high ductility both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D&amp;P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for development of high strength, high ductility materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Strength and ductility are key mechanical properties of metallic materials for developing energy-efficient and lightweight structural components in a wide variety of industries, including automotive and aerospace. Unfortunately, improving strength or ductility often results in the degradation of the other property, which is known as the strength-ductility trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Cost is also an issue as alloying elements that help improve both properties, such as cobalt and titanium, tend to be expensive. Previous efforts towards resolving this trade-off focused on engineering defects like grain boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref> and coherent twinboundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. However, the strength may reach a limit when grain size or twin-boundary spacing is reduced to nanometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Dislocations or line defects are a different pathway for engineering alloy properties. In contrast to the above planar defects, the strength of metallic materials monotonically increases with dislocation density according to the well-known Taylor hardening law <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The problem is that ductility tends to decrease as the number of dislocations increase. However, improved choices in alloy composition and clever processing strategies may allow dislocation engineering to circumvent the strength-ductility trade-off. In particular, achieving large ductility in the presence of high dislocation density in an inexpensive material produced by facile processing routes is desirable for broad industrial applications at an economic cost.</p><p>Severe plastic deformation (SPD) or phase transformation both generate high dislocation density in metals. Cold drawing is one SPD that introduces a very high dislocation density in pearlitic steel wires <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Cold drawing and other SPD methods also may lead to grain refinement (&lt;100 nm) in metals due to formation of high angle grain boundaries by re-arrangement of intensive dislocations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. In contrast, the first order solid state martensitic transformation produces a highly dislocated martensite microstructure without a lot of grain refinement (~500 nm) in steels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Either quenching or deformation can trigger martensitic transformation, depending on the alloying content of steels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. We show that rolling and low temperature tempering produced a high dislocation density in steel, also enabling a large ductility. In addition to the high dislocation density, interstitial C atoms partition into and help stabilize the austenite phase during tempering <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. We define this thermomechanical treatment as "deformed and partitioned (D&amp;P)" process and the corresponding steel as D&amp;P steel. The D&amp;P process could be realized with conventional processing techniques that are compatible with existing industrial production lines.</p><p>We used a medium Mn steel (10% Mn, 0.47% C, 2% Al and 0.7% V (wt.%)) for the D&amp;P process. The Mn and C atoms are effective austenite stabilizers (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). The addition of 2% Al content is to suppress cementite precipitation during tempering process. The addition of 0.7% V is to form intensive nanometer-sized V carbides which provided enhanced resistance to delayed fracture induced by hydrogen embrittlement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>. The D&amp;P steel that we produced by multiple deformation and annealing steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> possesses a heterogeneous lamella dual-phase microstructure in which metastable austenite are embedded in a martensite matrix (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). We obtained the martensite matrix by cold rolling (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) followed by tempering. The tempered martensite matrix has heterogeneous grain morphologies and sub-structures. Large lenticular martensite grains, which constitute the majority of matrix, are mainly decorated with dislocation cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Nevertheless, some large lenticular martensite grains also possess dislocations as well as twins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) and some small lath martensite grains with dislocations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) in the martensite matrix. We estimated the average dislocation density of martensite matrix (~1.27×10 16 m -2 ) with synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). Such a high dislocation density is due to the combination of plastic deformation and displacive shear transformation. The martensite we created differs from the thermally formed martensite obtained by quenching as it inherits dislocations generated from warm deformation. The early transformed martensite is also subjected to cold rolling, which we confirmed by the formation of dislocation cells in martensite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Consequently, the dislocation density in our martensite matrix is much larger than for thermally formed martensite (~2.36×10 14 m -2 ) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). The austenite phase also has a heterogeneous microstructure, including coarse lamella grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), ultrafine lamella grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) and sub-micron granular grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). The large austenite grains are decorated with a large number of dislocations as well as stacking faults (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>), while the small austenite grains mainly possess dislocations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). Both martensite and austenite phases contain nanometer-sized vanadium carbides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>) and solid solutes (C, Mn and V atoms). Although some layered austenite grains have higher Mn content (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>) from the banding of Mn in hot rolled strip (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), we also observed austenite grains with low Mn content and martensite with high Mn content (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). This suggests that the Mn banding does not determine retention of the layered austenite grains in the D&amp;P steel. Instead, it could be due to the mechanical stabilization induced by intensive defects in these layered austenite grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</p><p>The as-developed D&amp;P steel possessed an ultra-high yield strength of 2.21 GPa and 2.05 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The high yield strength is from the high dislocation density (ρt) in the martensite matrix. For instance, the yield stress (σ) due to dislocation forest strengthening is estimated to be 1.6 GPa according to Taylor hardening law (9</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) t M b σ αµ ρ = (1)</formula><p>where Taylor factor M is 2.9 (20), the empirical constant α is 0.23 for cell-forming dislocation distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, shear modulus μ is 85 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and Burgers vector b is 0.25 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Therefore, the yield stress induced by the high dislocation density is on the same order of magnitude as the macroscopic yield strength (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The collective contributions from the other strengthening defects, such as solid solutes, nano-precipitates, stacking faults, twin boundaries and ultrafine grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), elevated the yield strength beyond 2 GPa. Consequently, the D&amp;P steel has a higher yield strength than steel with a bimodal coarse-grained microstructure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>). Intriguingly, the D&amp;P steel also had a larger tensile uniform elongation (&gt;15%) than its bimodal coarse-grained counterpart. Our D&amp;P steel with high dislocation density has an inverse strength-ductility tradeoff similar to what has been found in other materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</p><p>The high dislocation density in our D&amp;P steel results in an ultra-high yield strength. The large uniform elongation is also due to the dislocation density. The D&amp;P steel demonstrates discontinuous yielding followed by large Lüders strains (ε) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The enhanced yield drop after the prolonged annealing is a typical feature of strain aging during which both mobile and immobile dislocations are segregated by solid solutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Martensite has an inherently high ratio (~18%) of mobile screw dislocations from displacive shear transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>. The mobile and immobile dislocations in martensite could re-arrange to form dislocation cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) during cold rolling, while the characteristics of dislocations remain the same <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. The dislocation cells consist of cell interior with low dislocation density and cell wall with high dislocation density. The catastrophic release and glide of the mobile screw dislocations from the cell wall leads to the collapse and break of original cell boundaries and formation of elongated dislocation cell structure after Lüders strain, which we confirmed by comparing Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>. The elongated cell has an increased length of ~400 nm compared to the original cell structure, which indicates that the average glide distance of the mobile screw dislocations is ~400 nm. A general relationship between plastic strain and mobile dislocation density (ρm) can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> m b L M ε ρ =</p><p>(2) where L is the average glide distance of the mobile dislocations (~400 nm). We assumed the ratio of mobile dislocation density to total dislocation density is 18% for deformation-induced martensite <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, given a mobile dislocation density of 2.3×10 15 m -2 in the martensite matrix. Consequently, the plastic strain induced by glide of these mobile dislocations in the martensite matrix is estimated to be 6.8%, which constitutes to a large portion of measured Lüders strain (7%~9%) in the D&amp;P steel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The high mobile dislocation density in the martensite matrix accommodates a large plasticity upon yielding. The catastrophic release and glide of the mobile screw dislocations result in a low but positive strain hardening rate during Lüders strain regime (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>). Such a low but positive strain hardening rate has been reported in irradiated metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> and omegacontaining Ti-alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, in which the operation of dislocation channeling is the governing deformation mechanism.</p><p>Besides the high mobile dislocation density, the D&amp;P steel had a continuous transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect at a large strain during the tensile test (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). The TRIP effect resulted from the formation of martensite in the coarse layered austenite grains. This TRIP effect applied compressive residual stress to effectively blunt localized plasticity during tensile straining (fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, and also provided dynamic strain partitioning between phases and improved strain hardening (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. The formation of the large martensite grains suggests that coarse layered austenite grains are less stable than ultra-fine austenite grains during uni-axial tensile deformation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). Nevertheless, most of these coarse layered austenite grains only transform to martensite at strains beyond the Lüders strain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), suggesting their high mechanical stability in the D&amp;P steel. We ascribed the enhancement in the mechanical stability to the high dislocation density in large austenite grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) where dislocations can act as barriers for glissile martensite interface and therefore stabilize austenite grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Moreover, the hard martensite matrix (fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) can shield austenite from deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, allowing the austenite to transform at large strain regime. The austenite grains in the D&amp;P steel were further stabilized by C partitioning from martensite (fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> relative to the ones in deformed steel (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>). Besides the effect of C partitioning and relatively higher Mn content (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>), the high dislocation density in the D&amp;P steel also controlled release of TRIP effect, improving ductility.</p><p>The D&amp;P steel also had a twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effect during the tensile test. We mostly observed the TWIP effect, induced by the formation of deformation twins, in ultra-fine austenite grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). The initiation of nanotwins from phase boundary suggests a high stress level experienced by lamella austenite grain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). Therefore, the TWIP effect also operated in the large strain regime (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>). The minor austenite volume fraction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) of the small grains means we expect the TWIP effect to be much less important than the TRIP effect, even as deformation twins can accumulate deformations and improve ductility (4).</p><p>We compared the bulk properties of D&amp;P steel to other high strength metallic materials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The D&amp;P steel exhibits a yield strength that is 50% higher than that of nanobainite steel while maintaining a comparable uniform elongation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Moreover, it exhibits a uniform elongation that is one order of magnitude larger than that of commercial maraging steels while maintaining an equivalent yield strength. Consequently, our D&amp;P steel achieves excellent tensile properties and defines a new space in the strength-ductility map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Despite of its discontinuous yielding and Lüders strain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the ultra-high yield strength of our D&amp;P steel makes it a desirable alloy for applications where yield strength is the main design criteria.</p><p>The D&amp;P overcomes the challenge of creating martensite known to be an issue for compositionally similar steels that rely on a quenching and partitioning process (13) (fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>). The high dislocation density in the D&amp;P steel not only increases the yield strength by dislocation forest hardening but also enables a large ductility by the glide of existing mobile dislocations and by the controlled release of TRIP effect. The high dislocation density is the origin of the inverse strength-ductility trade-off. We expect this strategy will be useful in other systems with similar deformation-induced martensitic transformation mechanism such as titanium alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. The D&amp;P steel exhibits low raw materials cost as compared to the maraging steel while maintaining a comparable ultimate tensile strength (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>). Therefore, by engineering dislocations, we simultaneously alleviate the economic concerns while achieving ultra-high strength.     <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, maraging steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>, dual-phase (DP) steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, martensitic steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>, TRIP steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>, quenching and partitioning (Q&amp;P) steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, nanotwinned steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45)</ref>, maraging-TRIP steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, high specific strength steel (HSSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, high entropy alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref>, nanostructured lamella Ti (3), Ti6Al4V (47), tungsten <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>, Inconel 718 (51), nanostructured Mo alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref> and nanostructured Co alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>. Our D&amp;P steel is clearly separated from the general trend and, therefore defines a new space in the strength-ductility map. Note the uniform elongation is selected here not only because it is a desirable property, but also because it is less affected by the sample dimensions used in different studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Our D&amp;P steel is clearly separated from the general trend and, therefore defines a new space in the strength-ductility map. Note the uniform elongation is selected here not only because it is a desirable property, but also because it is less affected by the sample dimensions used in different studies<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</figDesc><graphic coords="8,137.25,72.00,336.89,192.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
