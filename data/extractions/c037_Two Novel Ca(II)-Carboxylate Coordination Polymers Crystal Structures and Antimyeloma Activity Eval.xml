In this case, continuous efforts have been paid to find better and more effective drugs for cancer treatment. For the being now, the metal-based complexes that formed by the connection of metal ions with the organic ligands via the coordination bonds have been widely explored as anticancer reagents with cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin as the representatives, but these complexes usually suffer from several shortcomings, such as drug resistance and high toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, efforts to overcome these shortcomings have encouraged scientists to fabricate diverse analogs, which are not only valuable for obtaining anticancer drugs with better therapy efficiency, but also for providing useful tools for probing the relationship between structure and anticancer activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As a new class of organic-inorganic hybrid material composed of multidentate organic ligands as connectors and metal ions/clusters as nodes, coordination polymers (CPs) or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combining the advances of 1 Department of Emergency, 3201 Hospital, Hanzhong, Shaanxi, China. 2 Department of Medical-Record, First People′s Hospital of Jining City, Jining, Shandong, China. 3 Department of Emergency, Binzhou People′s Hospital, Binzhou, Shandong, China. 4 Department of Orthopedics, Yan′an People′s Hospital, Yan′an, Shaanxi, China; *an_tong666@126.com.

The large surfaces, adjustable functionalities and controlled morphology of CPs have resulted in their booming development which could be applied as functional materials in many important domains such as drug delivery, gas storage/separation and biomedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Recent studies have revealed that some CPs could be used as anticancer reagents, which show the metal and morphology-dependent anticancer activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The metal ions in CPs can replace other important metals in enzymes of cancer cells, which may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Moreover, CPs can impose noncovalent interactions with the DNA molecules of cancer cells though groove binding and intercalation, which might also contribute to the growth inhibition of cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Many CPs have been reported to show anticancer activities in vitro and in vivo which even perform better than the famous anticancer drug cisplatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Compared with the widely explored transition metal CPs (such as Ni 2+ and Co 2+ ), the main group metal-based CPs (such as Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) are less studied as anticancer reagents although they are more biocompatible. On the other hand, the organic ligand plays an important role in the final transportation efficiency of the anticancer reagents across the cell membrane, which is highly associated with the targeted biological activity. In this work, we employ two tridentate organic ligands with the C 3 -symmetry, 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoic acid (H 3 NTB), and benzene-1,3,5tribenzoic acid (H 3 BTB), to build main group metal-based CPs based on the following considerations. First, the unique molecular symmetry for the H 3 BTB and H 3 NTB ligands make them ideal connectors in the field of CP chemistry which could result in highly symmetrical 3D networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Second, the H 3 BTB and H 3 NTB ligands have great potential for the formation of cage-or channel-type CPs, which are the key features of porous CPs that could be applied in various fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For instance, Chen et al. have successfully developed new Li(I)-based CP with the H 3 NTB ligand, which could be applied in the detection of the Fe(III) ion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Kitagawa and co-workers have reported Ba(II)-based CP based on the H 3 BTB ligand, which shows a robust microporous character after the guest removal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this study, two new Ca(II)-based CPs</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[Ca 3 (BTB) 2 (NMP) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](NMP)(H 2 O) 4 (1, H 3 BTB = benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoic acid, NMP = N-methyl-pyrrolidone) and [Ca 3 (NTB) 2 (DEF) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](DEF)(H 2 O) 4 (2, H 3 NTB = 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoic acid, DEF = N,N-diethyl-formamide) have</formula><p>been successfully synthesized by the solvothermal reaction of CaCl 2 and two rigid C 3 -symmetric tricarboxylic acid ligands (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The structural analysis of complexes 1 and 2 demonstrates the existence of different topologies and structures in the as-prepared complexes because of the conformational flexibility of the organic ligands and the diverse geometry of the Ca(II)-based 1D secondary building unit. Complex 1 is a three-dimensional framework based on the Ca(II)-based 1D rod-like chains connected via the BTB 3-ligands with 1D rhombus channels along the axis. The structure of complex 2 could be viewed as the connection of Ca3 clusters via the NTB 3-ligands to afford a (4,6,7)-connected net. Furthermore, the size of both CPs could be downsized into the nanosized region via a reflux treatment. In addition, the cytotoxic properties of the two nanosized structures against human myeloma cell lines have been evaluated via the MTT assay.</p></div>

After the incubation of cells for up to 96 h, medium was removed from each cell and 150 μL of an MTT (0.5 mg/mL) solution, diluted 10-fold by RPMI 1460 was subsequently added. The IC 50 values were measured by depicting the viability to concentration ratio on a logarithmic chart and reading off the concentration where 50% of viable cells were involved in the control. In order to get the mean values, it is requested that each experiment was conducted at least three times in the same way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Molecular structure. Solvothermal synthesis has been employed for the preparation of the two frameworks described in the present study since this synthetic protocol not only increases the solubility of the as-synthesized complexes, but also often favors an ordered molecular self-assembly. The structural analysis of 1 by single-X ray diffraction reveals that it belongs to the monoclinic space group C2/c which possesses a non-interpenetrated three-dimensional network with onedimensional rhombus channels in each net. The asymmetric part of the unit cell consists of one and a half crystallographically unique Ca(II) ions, one fully deprotonated BTB 3-ligand, one coordinated water, and one coordinated NMP molecule. The Ca1 atom, sitting on the 2-fold axis, is eight-coordinated with carboxylic O atoms on six different BTB 3-ligands; the Ca2 atom with a full occupancy is seven-connected with five carboxylic O atoms on six different BTB 3-ligands with the remaining two sites finished by two O atoms from the coordinated water and NMP molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). The Ca-O bond distances are in the range 2.343(2) Å to 2.802(2) Å, which correspond to the normal values of reported Ca(II)-based CPs. The adjacent Ca(II) ions are held together via the carboxylic groups on the BTB 3-ligands to give rise to a 1D rod-like secondary building unit (SBU) chains along the a axis with the Ca1-Ca2 separation of 3.642(3) Å. Each BTB 3-ligand binds with seven different Ca 2+ ions through two different coordination modes, which can be described as (η 1 -η 2 )-(η 1 -η 1 )-(η 2 -η 2 )-μ 7 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). The 1D Ca(II)-based infinite chains are interconnected by BTB 3-linkers in the bc plane, which leads to the formation of a three-dimensional network with one-dimensional rhombic pores along the a direction. The terminally coordinated aqua and NMP molecules are directed towards the pore interior, thus blocking the pores to some extent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). The total solvent accessible volume for 1 is 3663.4 Å 3 , corresponding to 42.3% of the unit cell volume. The TOPOS analysis indicates that the net of 1 could be viewed as a three-nodal 5,6,7-connected network with the point symbol of {3.4 7 .5 4 .6 8 .8}2{3 2 .4 6 .5 2 }2{4 10 .5.6 4 } (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</p><p>The single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that compound 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn and has a cluster-based three-dimensional network. Its asymmetric unit contains one and a half crystallographically unique Ca(II) ions, one fully deprotonated NTB 3-ligand, one coordinated water molecule, and one coordinated DEF molecule. The two Ca(II) ions in 2 adopt different coordination modes. The Ca1 atom has a half occupancy and is eight-coordinated with eight carboxylic O atoms from six different NTB 3-ligands to form CaO 8 polyhedral units; while the coordination surrounding of Ca2 is completed by five O atoms from four different NTB 3-ligands and two O atoms from the coordinated water and DEF molecules to form a CaO 7 polyhedral unit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). These polyhedral units are linked through edges to form the trimeric Ca 3 O 22 cluster with the Ca1-Ca2 separation of 3.5378(5) Å. There is one NTB anion present in the structure that binds with seven Ca ions using its three carboxylic groups whose coordination mode could be described as (η</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 -η 2 )-(η 1 -η 2 )-(η 1 -η 2 )-μ 7</formula><p>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). The connectivity in 2 between the trimeric Ca 3 O 22 cluster and NTB 3-anions gives rise to a three-dimensional structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). Due to the closely packed structure of 2 and a relatively large molecular volume of the DEF molecule, complex 2 shows no solvent-accessible free volume as calculated via the software PLATON. The topological analysis with the TOPOS software identified that the structure had a new topological network with a 3-nodal net, a 4,6,7-connected net, which can be presented as the Schläfli symbol {4 10 .6 5 }{4 4 .6 2 } 2 {4 9 .6 9 .8 3 } 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>). PXRD, TGA and SEM characterization. To character the phase purity of as-prepared two CPs 1 and 2, their powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded using their crystalline samples at room temperature and the profiles were plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>. The PXRD profiles for the as-prepared samples show sharp peaks, reflecting their high crystallinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R</head><note type="other">A</note><p>For CP 1, the experimental diffraction patterns have a group of strong peaks in the range 25-30°, while they are absent in the simulated curve. This discrepancy might be due to the following reason: in the as-prepared samples of 1, there exist many NMP and water solvents in the lattice, but their electronic contribution was removed from the crystal data by the squeeze option in PLATON. Even if NMP and water crystal solvents are disordered in the voids, their electron density still contributes to diffraction, thus resulting in the additional peaks in the patterns of the as-prepared samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For CP 2, the experimental diffraction patterns agree with those of simulated ones regarding to the peak positions. The peak intensities in the range 5-7 might be attributed to the preferred orientation of the crystallographic plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To study the thermodynamic stability of the two compounds, TGA was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C per min in the temperature range from 25 °C to 800 °C under the continuous nitrogen flow. Complex 1 reveals a sustained weight loss of 28.8% in the temperature range from 25 °C to 501 °C, corresponding to the removal of solvent molecules (both coordinated and uncoordinated lattice solvent molecules). After the loss of guest solvents, a sharp weight loss could be observed, indicating the collapse of the framework. For complex 2, a continuous weight loss of 16.9% could be observed from room temperature to 487 °C, corresponding to the escape of a half of lattice DEF molecules, two coordinated H 2 O and two lattice H 2 O molecules. Below that temperature, the framework began to decompose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).  Considering the following biomedical application, it is necessary to downsize the particles of two CPs to the nanometer scale. Generally speaking, nanoscale CPs could more easily pass though the cell membrane of targeting cancerous tissue and be absorbed by cancerous tissues via the intravenous injection. In a typical experiment, a DMF solution of the organic ligand was added to an aqueous solution combining Ca(CH 3 COO) 2 . After vigorous stirring at 25 °C for 120 min, EtOH was injected into the solution to produce a light-yellow precipitate. SEM images revealed spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 110±17 nm (nano 1) or 94±11 nm (nano 2), confirming the successful formation of the nanoparticles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Furthermore, the nano 1 and nano 2 maintained their structural integrality as formed, according to the PXRD measurements.  Anticancer activity. The cytotoxicities of two nanostructures 1 and 2 along with the organic H 3 BTB and H 3 NTB ligands against three human myeloma cell lines (MM1S, RPMI-8226, and ARH-77) were studied via the standard MTT assay with cisplatin as the positive control. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref> shows the IC 50 (half maximum inhibitory concentration) values calculated using the experimental data. It could be observed that no obvious anticancer activity was found for the two organic ligands against all these cell lines because all their IC 50 values are far above 100 µM. Under the concentration of 100 µM, H 3 BTB and H 3 NTB should show high cytotoxicity toward all the three cancer cell lines, therefore, it could be inferred that the organic ligands did not show any anticancer activity towards these cell lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R</head><note type="other">A</note><p>In comparison, after compounds nano 1-2 were incubated with the cancer cells for three days, the calculated IC 50 values from the experimental data for these compounds were in the range from 86 μM to 29 μM, indicating that nano 1 and nano 2 showed the anticancer activity toward the MM1S, RPMI-8226, and ARH-77 cells in different degrees. It could be observed that nano 2 shows lower IC 50 values compared with those of nano 1, which are even comparable with the famous anticancer drug cisplatin. The present results indicate that the organic ligand has a great effect on the biological activity of resulting CPs. To study the cytotoxicity of nano 1 and nano 2 toward the human normal cell lines, these complexes were incubated with oral epidermal cells (normal cells) for 24 h at different concentrations (0-120 μg/mL), and the cell viability was plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>. It could be easily read out that even at a concentration of 120 µg/mL of nano 1-2, the cell viabilities all </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In summary, we successfully prepared two Ca(II)-based CPs by the reaction of CaCl 2 and two rigid C 3 -symmetric tricarboxylic acid ligands under solvothermal conditions. The structural analysis of complexes 1 and 2 demonstrates the existence of different topologies and structures in the as-prepared complexes because of the conformational flexibility of the organic ligands and diverse geometry of the Ca(II)-based 1D secondary building unit. Their nanoscale samples have been studied for the inhibition of human myeloma cell growth via the MTT assay, which revealed that the organic ligand had a great effect on the biological activity of resulting CPs.</p></div>
