<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p><p>H ot (nonequilibrium) carrier thermalization is one of the major sources for efficiency loss in solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref>. Such loss can be reverted if the hot carriers can be harvested before they equilibrate with the lattice, and the ultimate thermodynamic limit on conversion efficiency can be increased from the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33% to about 66% <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2)</ref>. The main challenge for harvesting hot carriers is the relatively short distance they travel before losing their excess energy to the lattice, typically on the picosecond time scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>. Hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites, such as CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , have emerged to be a class of highly efficient solar cell materials with remarkable charge transport properties, achieving efficiency above 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. Recently, ultrafast spectroscopic measurements have revealed surprisingly long-lived hot carriers on the order of 100 ps in these hybrid perovskites <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>.</p><p>The remarkably long hot-carrier lifetime in the hybrid perovskites, about two to three orders of magnitude longer than in conventional semiconductors, raises the question of whether hot carriers can be harvested to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit. However, the current understanding on hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites is limited, despite efforts that have been devoted to studying carrier cooling dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. In particular, the crucial parameter of hot-carrier transport length must be comparable to the thickness necessary for photon absorbance.</p><p>To correctly evaluate the potential of hot-carrier perovskite solar cells, measurements to provide quantitative results on the length scales of hot-carrier transport in relation to carrier cooling time scales are necessary. Combining microscopy techniques with ultrafast optical pumping can be an effective solution for achieving simultaneous temporal and spatial resolutions of carrier dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>. Here, we report on a direct visualization of hot-carrier transport in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 thin films using ultrafast transient absorption microscopy (TAM) with 50-nm spatial precision and 300-fs temporal resolution. These experiments revealed three distinct transport regimes, specifically, quasiballistic transport for the initial hot carriers, nonequilibrium transport for the protected longlived hot carriers, and diffusive transport for the cooled carriers.</p><p>We performed measurements on a uniform and highly crystalline CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite thin film deposited on a SiO 2 substrate, and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> of the supplementary materials (SM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Solar cell efficiencies of ~18% have been achieved by using films fabricated with the same procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the thin film investigated are shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>.</p><p>We first carried out ensemble transient absorption measurements to establish spectroscopic signatures for hot carriers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Immediately after photoexcitation, a photoinduced absorption (PIA, negative change of transmission DT/T ) band centered at 1.58 eV was observed whose amplitude (|DT/T|) increased as the pump photon energy increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Global analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) indicates that this PIA band is associated with a broadened ground-state bleach (GSB, positive DT/T ) band with a high-energy tail consistent with Fermi-Dirac distribution at high carrier temperature. The PIA band resulted from the shifting of the band-gap energy DE g , which was a com-bination of band-gap renormalization effect (narrowing the band gap by DE BGN ) and Burstein-Moss effect (or band-filling, widening the band gap by DE BM ), as described by DE g = DE BM -DE BGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>. Because DE BM would not take effect until the hot carriers relax to the band edge, the red-shifted PIA band at 1.58 eV at 0 ps was due to DE BGN predominantly. The amplitude of the PIA band increased as the pump photon energy increased, which could be explained by the decreased occupation of the states near the band edge leading to a decreased DE BM . Once carriers cooled down and DE BM settled in, the PIA band at 1.58 eV decayed and a blue-shifted PIA band was observed (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Based on these observations, we assigned the PIA band at 1.58 eV to hot carriers, in agreement with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30)</ref>.</p><p>DT/T of the PIA band had a different dependence on carrier density n than that of the GSB band when probed at 1.58 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). DT/T of the GSB band scaled linearly with n, whereas DT/T of the PIA band was proportional to n<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref>/<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> . Because D T/T of the PIA band scaled linearly with DE BGN as empirically shown in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), this observation indicated that DE BGN º n 1/2 . A n 1/3 dependence for DE BGN is generally expected when carriers are weakly interacting, but an n 1/2 term must be included when carrier-carrier interactions become more important <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31)</ref>. For instance, the n 1/2 dependence becomes dominant at n &gt; 10 17 cm -3 for GaAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>. The n 1/2 dependence observed here implies that carrier-carrier interactions are not negligible for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 .</p><p>The PIA band decayed with a ~400-fs time constant when excited at 3.14 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), which has been assigned to the emission of the longitudinal optical phonons <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32)</ref>. The lifetime for the PIA band shortened to ~280 fs when the pump photon energy was reduced to 1.97 eV (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. The decay of the PIA band was accompanied by the growth of the GSB band at the band edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> is a second and slower cooling process with a time constant of ~78 ps. The much slower cooling phase has been ascribed to the protection of the energetic carriers by the formation of large polarons <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>, hot phonon effects (carrier density &gt; 10 18 cm -3 ) ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), and optical-acoustic phonon scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>.</p><p>We imaged hot-carrier transport initiated by two different pump photon energies: 3.14 eV (1.49 eV above band gap) and 1.97 eV (0. 32 eV above band gap) with a probe photon energy of 1.58 eV. The pump beam was held at a fixed position while the probe beam was scanned relative to the pump with a pair of galvanometer scanners to form an image (see more details in the SM, fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33)</ref>. The precision in determining carrier propagation distance was dictated by the smallest measurable change in the excited state population profiles and not directly by the diffraction limit (34). This limit is ~50 nm for the current experimental conditions, as discussed in the SM <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. The carrier density for these measurements was ~4 × 10 17 cm -3 , where Auger recombination and hot phonon effect were negligible (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33)</ref>.</p><p>The initial population was created by a Gaussian pump beam at position (x 0 , y 0 ), with a pulse duration of ~300 fs. We defined an instrument response function (IRF) = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi s 2 ðpumpÞ þ s 2 ðprobeÞ p that described the response of a pump-probe microscope to a point object, where s 2 ðpumpÞand s 2 ðprobeÞ were the variance of the Gaussian pump and probe beams. The IRF was determined to be 260 ± 5 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) by measuring a tetracene single crystal under similar experimental conditions at 0 ps because exciton transport within the pulse width for tetracene is negligible <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>. At 0-ps time delay, carrier distribution should be equal to the convolution of the probe and probe beams if no transport occurs within the pulse width. Only negative DT (PIA) was observed at 0-ps delay, indicating that the initially created carriers were out of equilibrium for both pump photon energies. Because the DT PIA is proportional to n 1/2 , the carrier distribution can be obtained by nðx; y; 0Þº½DT PIA ðx; y; 0Þ 2 . For 3.14 eV photon excitation, the 0-ps image showed morphology-dependent structures that were not easily described by a Gaussian function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). To average out the morphological effects, we interpolated ½DT PIA ðx; y; 0Þ 2 onto a polar coordinate, summed over all angles, and plotted it as a function of radial distance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Carrier distribution at 0 ps was fitted by a Gaussian function with a variance s 2 0 of 350 ± 10 nm, much larger than that of the IRF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Thus, hotcarrier transport must have occurred within the pulse duration. The transport distance within the pulse width was calculated as ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi s 2 0 -IRF 2 p = 230 ± 16 nm. In contrast, when the pump photon energy was reduced to 1.97 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), negligible carrier transport within the pulse width was observed and the initial hot-carrier population distribution was similar to the IRF (fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>.</p><p>The excess energy-dependent carrier transport distance within the pulse width indicated that ballistic carrier transport played a role. When promoting carriers from the valance band to the conduction band, the excess energy above the band gap manifested as kinetic energy and distributed among the electrons and holes inversely proportional to their respective effective masses, m * e and m * h (2), which for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 both have a value of ~0.2 m 0 , the free electron mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36)</ref>. The ballistic velocity of the carriers v max is given by K eðhÞ ¼ 1 2 m * eðhÞ v 2 max , leading to a value of 1.6 × 10 6 and 0.7 × 10 6 ms -1 for 3.14 eV and 1.97 pump photon energies, respectively. For 3.14 eV excitation, the expansion of the width of the TAM image within the pulse width gave a velocity of 230 nm/ 300 fs = 0.8 × 10 6 ms -1 , on the same order as v max , indicating that the carrier motion was quasiballistic. Our time resolution was unable to resolve ballistic transport directly. Intriguingly, very little quasiballistic transport was observed for 1.97 eV excitation, which was probably limited by grain boundaries. There could be additional potential barriers at interfaces or "dynamic" barriers created by the fluctuating energy landscape that could also require excess kinetic energy to overcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref>. The larger initial kinetic energies of the hot  carriers created by 3.14 eV pump allowed more carriers to overcome grain boundaries, as shown in the 0-ps image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>.</p><p>Carrier cooling was also visualized by TAM, manifested as the negative DT signal (PIA) turning into the positive DT signal (GSB). The GSB signal appeared sooner for the 1.97 eV pump (after 300 fs) than for the 3.14 eV pump (after 1 ps), consistent with less excess energy to lose to the phonons. The GSB signal presented initially only in the center of TAM images, which can be explained by the PIA and the GSB DT having opposite signs and different carrier density dependence-i.e., DT PIA ðx; y; tÞº-nðx; y; tÞ 1=2 and DT GSB ðx; y; tÞº nðx; y; tÞ. The TAM profiles were then fitted using two-dimensional (2D) Gaussian functions for nðx; y; tÞ, with variances ofs 2</p><p>x;t and s 2 y;t as detailed in the SM <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Fits along one dimension for 1.2-ps pump-probe delay is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> (data for 100-ps delay shown in fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Because the carrier transport was isotropic-i.e., s 2</p><p>x;t ≈ s 2 y;t , we reduced the problem to 1D and defined s 2 t ¼ s 2 x;t þs 2 y;t 2 to average out morphological effects and plotted it as a function of pumpprobe delay time in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>. Carriers continued to move more rapidly for 3.14 eV excitation than 1.97 eV excitation on the 10s of picosecond time scale (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>), as the second and slower phase of carrier cooling set in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>. For 1.97 eV pump, s 2 t grew linearly as a function of delay time for &gt; 1 ps, indicative of diffusive transport as described by s 2 t -s 2 0 ¼ 2Dt (D is the diffusion coefficient, 0.7 ± 0.1 cm 2 s -1 ) (34). This large D value is consistent with the high crystallinity of our sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>. Diffusive transport indicated that thermal equilibrium with the lattice was reached. However, for the 3.14-eV excitation, diffusive transport was not observed until after 30 ps, and hot carriers migrated ~600 nm before reaching thermal equilibrium with the lattice. The diffusion coefficient was identical for 3.14-eV and 1.97-eV excitation after 100 ps. Recently, Li et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref> estimated almost an order of magnitude shorter hot-carrier transport distance of 16 to 90 nm for films of CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 nanoparticles, despite the fact that hot-carrier cooling times were two orders of magnitude slower in these nanoparticles than in bulk films. Thus, our results suggest that slow carrier cooling alone does not necessary lead to long-range transport, and morphology is also a critical factor.</p><p>We calculated the effective diffusion constant as DðtÞ ¼ Ds 2 t ðtÞ 2Dt for the 3.14-eV excitation. D(t) decreased from an initial value of 450 ± 10 cm 2 s -1 at 1 ps to the equilibrium value of 0.7 ± 0.1 cm 2 s -1 and could be fitted to a biexponential decay function with decay constants of 3 ± 1 ps and 20 ± 5 ps, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). The decay-time constants agreed overall with carrier cooling time. The fast decay-time constant (3 ps) was slower than that determined from the ensemble transient absorption measurements (400 fs), which can be understood as that the ensemble measurements integrating over a large area underestimated the cooling time because the PIA and GSB signals canceled each other out. Time-dependent carrier transport behavior was also observed directly in the corresponding carrier dynamics when probing away from the pump beam center with a 3.14-eV pump (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). The rapid growth of hotcarrier population (negative DT signal) when probing 1 mm and 1.5 mm away from the pump center persisted up to ~3 ps in good agreement with the initial fast transport, and the growth slowed down on the 10s of picosecond time scale. The fast growth was absent when probing 2 mm away because the initial fast transport did not reach that distance.</p><p>To understand the factors contributing to the extraordinary long-range hot-carrier transport, we compared CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to other conventional inorganic semiconductors. CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 has comparable electron effective mass as Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref>, and the ballistic velocity on the order of 10 6 ms -1 is also consistent with recent calculation for Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref>. The quasiballistic transport length of ~230 nm in 300 fs for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , however, is much longer than that of ~85 nm for GaAs (40), ~20 nm for Si (6), and ~14 nm for GaN <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref> and can be explained by slower momentum relaxation in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 than in conventional semiconductors, ~100 fs as predicted by first principle calculations for hot carriers with excess energy of 1 eV <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref>. In comparison, relaxation times of 10 to 20 fs were found for hot carriers with excess energy &gt; 0.3 eV for Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref>.</p><p>The nonequilibrium transport behavior of carriers in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 over 10s of picoseconds also deviates from conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, for which equilibrium with the lattice is achieved in a few picoseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42)</ref>. Interestingly, nonequilibrium carrier transport on the picosecond time scale was not observed when pump photon energy is reduced to 1.97 eV.</p><p>An energetic E* state with an energy of ~0.3 eV above the band edge has been observed to form at ~1 ps by two-photon photon emission spectroscopy and is also confirmed by density-of-state calculation    <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>. This E* state probably could not be created by 1.97 eV (0.32 eV above band edge) photon excitation because of insufficient excess energy. Based on these observations, we attributed the nonequilibrium transport over 10s of picoseconds to hot carriers associated with the energetic E* state. The E* state is accompanied by the formation of large polarons occurring on the ~1-ps time scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>. The long-lived and nondiffusive transport observed is also consistent with the large polaron picture, because the slow decay constant for D agrees well with the slow cooling of hot polarons by acoustic phonon scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>. These polarons are "heavier" than the bare carriers with nonparabolic dispersion <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref>, which could explain a lower diffusion coefficient on the 10s of picosecond time scale. The long-range hot-carrier transport is most likely not limited to CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , because many hybrid organicinorganic metal halide perovskites share similar carrier relaxation characteristics. The long-range motion associated with slow carrier cooling processes makes hybrid perovskites potential materials for hot-carrier devices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
