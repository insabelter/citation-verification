<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiobjective Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (MO-FJSP) is a scheduling problem used in manufacturing sectors to use energy efficiently and thriftily. (e scheduling problem aims to increase productivity and reduce energy consumption via a mathematical model. With this paper, an effective genetic algorithm is proposed for MO-FJSP based on maximum completion time, total machine load, and bottleneck machine load. (e solution method utilizes a hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm. A combination of global selection and fast selection is used for initialization and obtaining a uniformly distributed initial population. (e cross-variance operator is adaptively improved to enhance the searching in the population. Following that an elite retention mechanism is designed to address the possible limitations of the elite strategy in maintaining population diversity. As a result, an improved harmonic search algorithm is introduced to improve the quality of individuals in the elite pool. (e proposed hybrid method is implemented in MATLAB R2018a. Tests were conducted using the benchmark Kacem test set, the BR data data set, and with the actual production cases. (e algorithm succeeded in achieving 13 nondominated solutions in the initial 20 runs. Moreover, the method obtains the optimal value criterion for the solution accuracy factor. As a whole, results of the evaluation testify that the proposed method can be used to solve the MO-FJSP with high accuracy and fast convergence. (e method also provides feasible and effective scheduling solutions for the decision-makers in actual production. Based on the promising results obtained, it is deduced that the method has a wide applicability range particularly in manufacturing sector.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With every passing day, awareness about environmental issues and lack of energy sources, new ways are searched out to efficiently use energy in the manufacturing of machines and mechanical units <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. For energy-efficient production processes, job-shop scheduling is been suggested by the researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. (e traditional approaches of Job Shop Problems (JSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> were all about minimizing the makespan. MO-FJSP on the other hand deals with the selection of operations together with influencing the sequence of operations <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Various scheduling approaches have also been proposed for productive utilization of resources. For instance, Shopfloor production scheduling is an effective scheduling method that can be used for effective and optimization as well. (e rational scheduling method for the production plans in the manufacturing process is another useful approach. (e method plays a key role in improving the productivity, resource utilization, and cost reduction of enterprises. Nevertheless, the Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP) introduces new decision content into the traditional job-scheduling problem. (e additional content supported in FJSP includes the solution of two subproblems. One of the subproblems is to select the appropriate machine for each process. (e second subproblem is to determine the start and end processing time of the processes, a more complex NP-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</p><p>After nearly 30 years of exploration, the research of FJSP has achieved fruitful results. Until now, different metaheuristic algorithms have been successfully applied in practical scheduling problems. For instance, the genetic algorithm (GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, particle swarm algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, forbidden search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, and simulated annealing algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> are some of the extensively used algorithms. With</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>advancement in research, the multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling (MO-FJSP) appeared to be more in line with the production reality. Hence, MO-FJSP has become a pressing problem to be solved. Since last decade, new algorithms have been proposed to offer more options and to conveniently solve MO-FJSP. Meng, Champion et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> proposed a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm. (e algorithm utilizes different search methods in three distinct stages: hiring bee, following bee, and detecting bee. In addition, a forbidden search algorithm is introduced to improve the probability of obtaining the optimal solution. Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> proposed an improved artificial immunity algorithm. (e algorithm makes the use of Metropolis criterion of simulated annealing algorithm to speed up the search efficiency while ensuring the population diversity. Ju et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> proposed an improved whale swarm algorithm. To expand the search range of individual whales, the algorithm follows a cooperative search mechanism. (e global and local search-ability of the population is improved by introducing the variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm. Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> suggested a variable neighborhood weed optimization algorithm to establish a scheduling model with De-jong learning effect. Besides, a variable neighborhood search algorithm is introduced in the most-recent iteration with three neighborhood structures: N1, N2, and N3. Effectiveness of the algorithm was verified through experiments. Recent studies suggest that a hybrid algorithm suffers from fewer shortcomings than a single algorithm. As a hybrid algorithm combines the characteristics of two or more algorithms, therefore, better adaptability and robustness is guaranteed. It is why current trends in the literature of job shop problem are to study and solve the MOJSP.</p><p>In this paper, a hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm (our method) is proposed to solve the MO-FJSP. (e method is based on the nondominated ranking genetic algorithm by introducing the harmony search (HS). Numerical experiments are demonstrated to assess feasibility, effectiveness, and practicality of the proposed algorithm. (e promising results obtained testify superiority of the proposed method.</p><p>Rest of the paper is arranged as followed. Related literature is presented in Section 2. (e proposed method is discussed in Section 3. Experimental analysis is discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusion and future strategy is presented in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Most of the national-and international-level research on the single-objective FJSP problem mainly targets the maximum workpiece completion time. Key motive of the research works is to shrink the maximum workpiece completion time. For the purpose, a GA is proposed by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> to generate a high-performance initialization population. (e algorithm employs a strategy of mixing two machine assignment rules and three process sequencing rules. (e two-population algorithm of Nawaz Ripon <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> works on picking two subpopulations to optimize two subproblems, machine allocation, and process sequencing sequences.</p><p>Similarly, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> designed a machine-selection method for the effective solution of machine load balancing. (e algorithm follows three selection strategies (global, local, and random) to generate solution. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> defined a new transformation method based on differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm for solving FJSP. To improve search performance, the method combines DE with critical path based local search technique. In a similar research work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, the critical path local search strategy is used besides the shuffled frog leading algorithm (SFLA). (e method promises for the improved convergence performance of SFLA. In Osaba et al.'s study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, a discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithm is suggested to encode the machine selection and process ranking subproblems. (e designed algorithm transforms a continuous harmonic vector into two discrete vectors. (e strategy of VNS is proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> to solve the single-objective FJSP.</p><p>To summarize, there are two general approaches to multiobjective optimization problems: the a priori method and the posteriori method. Both of the methods deal with resolving possible conflicts involved in multiple objectives. (e a priori method generally uses the experience to form a single objective by linear weighting of multiple objectives. However, fewer solutions can be obtained using this type of method. (e method fails to reflect the trade-off between different objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Moreover, it is difficult to precisely determine weights of each objective. Enough experience is required to solve optimization problems; however, the true Pareto front is nonconvex <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> in the aggregation-based approach. From the in-depth analysis of the literature, it is clear the priori methods are basically used to transform the multiobjective into a single objective by weighting. Although a posteriori method may offer multiple solutions, the method lacks problem-based local search. Hence, the obtained solutions are somehow unreasonable and cannot guarantee a set of optimal solutions. It is why such algorithms do not effectively balance the global search and local development <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Details of some of the standard approaches in the realm of job shop problem are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments and Analysis of Results</head><p>In order to verify the feasibility, effectiveness, and practicality of the proposed MO-FJSP solution method, standard algorithms were selected for the evaluation. (e actual production cases for testing were derived from the widely acceptable algorithms including the Kacem test set <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> (8 × 8 (P-FJSP), 10 × 10 (T-FJSP), 15 × 10 (T-FJSP)), the BRdata data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> (MK01-MK10), and the BRdata data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> (MK01-MK10). (e algorithm is programmed using MATLAB R2018a. For the implementation and evaluation a laptop, with CPU Intel i7-4558U running at 2.80 GHz, having 4 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 operating system, was used. (e test objective functions were performed according to equations (1) to (3) presented in Section 1.2. (e parameters set used in the proposed method includes total number of iterations, population size, crossover probability range (0.4, 0.8), variation probability range (0.01, 0.2), number of iterations of the harmonic search algorithm, and probability of fine-tuning the harmonic memory bank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experimental Setup.</head><p>In order to systematically assess the proposed method from different perspectives, the following experiments were performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Experiment-1.</head><p>(e first experiment was conducted to compare the proposed method with the noninferior solutions of NSGA-II. After each 20 runs, results of the algorithms were compared in terms of maximum completion time and minimum under the BRdata data set. (e results obtained are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>, both the algorithms achieved promising results. Performance of the methods (the proposed and NSGA-II) are better than the Brandimarte's method. Unlike our proposed method, quality of noninferior solutions obtained by NSGA-II decreases with the increase of the problem size. For the problem MK02-MK10, the noninferior solutions obtained by our method are better than those obtained by NSGA-II. Moreover, the results of 20 operations do not fluctuate considerably. (is shows good stability in the quality of solutions. (e iterative process and the distribution of noninferior solutions for a certain runs of the MK01 problem are compared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Experiment-2.</head><p>Under the Kacem test set results, the proposed method is compared with the hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC + TS). (e ABC algorithm proposed by Champion Meng is considered to one of the state-of-theart algorithm in the literature. Moreover, the results were also compared with the other cutting-edge algorithms namely the variable neighborhood weed optimization algorithm (IWO + VNS) proposed by Lei Cao, and the hybrid algorithm of local approximation and control genetic algorithm (AL + CGA) proposed by Kacem. Outcomes of the comparison are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>.</p><p>It is clear from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>, that IWO + VNS obtained more noninferior solutions for the Kacem 8 × 8 problem. However, none of the algorithms reached the optimal value for the rest of the problems. Unlike others, the method proposed in this paper obtained the optimal value criterion in terms of solution accuracy. (e number of nondominated solutions obtained by the proposed method is also not inferior to the other algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3.">Experiment-3.</head><p>In order to robustly assess the practicality of our method, it is evaluated by solving practical problems. (is experiment intends to measure the judge the algorithm in scheduling case of an automotive wiring harness manufacturing enterprise. (e production process of an automotive wire harness includes wire laying, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>crimping, internal linking, subassembly and final assembly, and so on. Taking a wire harness with 6 branches as an example, the 6 subassembly branches in the corresponding process were treated to be 6 workpieces. Each of the workpiece J 1 , J 3 , J 4 , contains 4 processes with process sequence number: 1, 2, 3 and 4. (e workpiece J 2 , J 5 , J 6 contains 3 processes with process sequence numbers 1, 2, and 4. (e output of the product was deemed to be 50 pieces. (e production data of wire harness products are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>.</p><p>As presented in the actual production data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>, the NSGA-II and our proposed method were used for the scheduling solution. (e results were also compared with the traditional manual scheduling method. Outcomes of the scheduling methods in solving the actual problem are compared and shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>.</p><p>From the facts presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>, it is clear that the manual scheduling method relies more on human than the two intelligent scheduling algorithms. As the scheduling and production processing time is longer, therefore, the scheduling effect is poorer. Our proposed method has obvious advantages over the NSGA-II in terms of production processing time and the number of noninferior solutions despite the fact that the scheduling time was slightly longer. (e automotive wiring harness company can select the appropriate solution from the obtained noninferior solutions to guide the production.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>In summary, the method proposed in this paper has high solution accuracy and fast convergence. (e algorithm carries a commendable global and local search capability. (e method achieves optimal results on the selected benchmark instances of different scales and actual production cases. Moreover, the algorithm has better adaptability and robustness than the other contemporary algorithms. From the promising results obtained in the evaluation, it is proved that the proposed method is feasible and effective for solving MO-FJSP. Keeping in view  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and Future Strategy</head><p>In this paper, the population initialization, cross-variation method and elite retention strategy of NSGA-II were improved. (e method introduced intends to effectively ensure the population diversity and improve the global and local search capability of the algorithm. (e hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm of the method utilizes NSGA-II as the main and acoustic search as the supplement algorithm. (e advantages of both the algorithms are fully combined in one to improve the solution quality. (e feasibility and effectiveness features of the algorithm were assessed for solving MO-FJSP. Experimentations were conducted with the standard algorithms: Kacem test set, BRdata data set, and actual production cases. Outcomes of the assessments reveal that the method proposed has better practical significance.</p><p>In future, it is planned to augment the method so that the algorithm should dynamically study its own characteristics in depth. (is will enable the algorithm to explore the improvement strategies under different target requirements. By that way, the hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm will continuously improve, the solution quality will be enhanced and efficiency of the algorithm will be increased desirably. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of a multiflexible job shop scheduling problem.</figDesc></figure>
