<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The friction stir welding (FSW) of tool pin geometry plays a critical role in the final properties of the produced joint. The tool pin geometry directly affects the generation of heat and the flow of internal materials during the FSW process. The effects of the FSW tool pin angle on heat generation and internal flow have not been quantitatively investigated in detail. In this manuscript, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was implemented to analyze the effects of pin angle on the thermo-mechanical action during the FSW process of AA5058 Al-Mg alloy. Experimental test results validate the thermal outcomes of the used model. The obtained results revealed that, when the pin angle is increased, the heat generation decreases while the mechanical action of the tool increases. The internal heat distribution at a higher pin angle is symmetrical. The higher mechanical action of the tool decreases the viscosity of the internal materials and increases stirring action (materials flow) around the pin. Furthermore, plastic flow near the tool increased stirring action and formed a larger stir zone in the joint area.</p></div>

The quality of the final FSW product depends on many process parameters like rotational tool speed, tool traverse velocity, tool tilt angle, and tool plunge depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. On the other hand, some other parameters can affect the final properties of the FSW joints <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. FSW tool pin profile is one of the essential factors that alter the internal flow of stir zone (SZ) and consequently changes welded samples' heat generation rate and mechanical properties. Various experimental studies have shown that the FSW pin shape and pin size have affected the thermal cycles, internal flow behaviors of material, and tool loads during the FSW process. These factors determine the final joint properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Until now, leading research focused on investigating FSW tool pin shape effects on the final properties of the FSWed sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The straight cylinder triangle, square and hexagonal shapes are the main FSW pin profiles investigated experimentally. On the other hand, limited research output is available that simulated effects of FSW pin profile on thermo-mechanical properties of final joint <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The results indicated that the pin with more edges (like square or hexagonal pin) improves mechanical properties and internal material flow in joint line. On the other hand, it is shown that the size of the FSW tool pin also has a crucial impact on the thermo-mechanical behaviors in FSW joint line <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. During the FSW process, the bigger pin diameter increased axial force, traverse force, and maximum heat generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Instead, the larger tool pin diameter decreases the fatigue strength of the FSWed joint and decreases the mechanical properties of the dissimilar joint between aluminum and steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Among various geometrical parameters of the FSW tool, the pin trapped angle plays an important role. The available information on this issue is minimal. Zhang et al. considered various pin thicknesses and stated that for better pin effects during the FSW process, the ratio of shoulder to pin should be 3. Their report shows that the pin angle is related to the shoulder diameter to be effective during the FSW joining process <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Chen et al. employed a thermo-mechanical coupling model to investigate the effect of the FSW pin angle on the materials flow during FSW. They used 2024-T3 aluminum alloy as base metal and used three pins diameters. According to their results, at the higher pin angle, the heat generation and the materials flow are increased. They stated that the plastic flow near the tool increases at a higher pin diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Buffa et al. reported that at a higher pin angle, the generation heat increased and consequently bigger heat-affected zone (HAZ) and thermo-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ) are formed in joint lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The tool pin angle plays a significant role in determining materials' thermal changes and flows during the FSW process. Until now, many issues about the effects of tool pin angle effects are not understood comprehensively. On the other hand, various types of materials can have different plastic flow behavior. Due to available literature effects of FSW pin angle on the heat generation and material flow during FSW of Al-Mg alloys have not been considered. In this issue, this article aims to study the effects of FSW tool pin angle on thermo-mechanical mechanism during FSW of AA5058 aluminum alloy. In this study, a validated computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model has been implemented to quantitatively analyze the effect of FSW pin angle on the heat generation and flow properties in FSW of AA5058 aluminum alloy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Model Description</head><p>A three-dimensional (3D) coupled material flow and heat model was utilized in steady-state conditions in the present study. The simulation procedure was done on the commercially ANSYS FLUENT software under the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The simulation domain dimension and geometry are defined according to the experimental tests, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. A 3D Cartesian system for the welded material (WM) and the FSW tools was established. All geometries and process parameters were selected according to the experimental tests. The origin was set at the middle point of the FSW tool shoulder. The x-axis indicated the welding direction, and the z-axis indicated the FSW tool normal axis. The FSW tool had rotational movement, and the interior domain was set to move according to the welding tool speed. The interior domain had the same velocity as the welding tool by the velocity inlet side. The sidewalls, along with the top and bottom, had the same velocity as the velocity of the inlet. The outer plate of the workpiece was set at zero pressure to avoid the reverse flow at the pressure outlet. The WM is assumed to be a non-Newtonian single-phase fluid representing the quasi-static thermal and fluid flow boundary problem. In this case, it is necessary to solve Navier-Stokes equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Boundary Conditions</head><p>Where there is a difference in the thermal conductivity between the WM and the FSW tool, the heat transferred to the FSW tool from WM should be considered. The partition of the generated heat is transferred by the FSW tool at the interface of WM. For this reason, the conduction heat transfer model is set on the interface of the tool-workpiece. The heat losses at the walls (top, sides, and bottom surfaces of WM) include the convection and radiation heat transfer during the FSW <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The sides walls and bottom surface of the workpiece are connected to the welding fixture and conduction heat transfer in those areas set. At the top surface of WM, radiation and convection heat transfer models were implemented. The meshed domain is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental Procedure</head><p>The 4 mm thickness AA5058 alloy aluminum alloy was selected as WM. The weld metal properties are evaluated in the laboratory in order to use in the simulation section. Mechanical and thermal properties of used WM are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The WM fixed in welding setup for the FSW process to remove any movement during the FSW process. The picture of the welding fixture and WM is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>. A modified milling machine (EF16, Tabriz, Iran) was used for the FSW process. After several trials and error testing plans, the optimum process parameters were selected during the experimental procedures. The tool rotational and traverse velocities were 850 rpm and 30 mm/min. The tool plunge depth and tilt angles were 0.2 mm and 2 • , respectively. For evaluation of simulation results, a thermal monitoring system is employed to record maximum heat generation during the FSW process. For this reason, two K-type thermocouples (Omega, Oakland, CA, USA) were placed on the WM's surface to record the temperature during the FSW procedure. One thermocouple is placed on the advancing side (AS) of WM and one on the retreating side (RS) of WM. The thermocouples were fixed at a 10.5 mm distance from the interface of base metals. The fixed thermocouple in AS is named T1, and the fixed thermocouple in RS is named T2. For further investigation, the obtained output from thermocouples reported as T1 and T2 results. To better understand the thermocouple's place, the location of thermocouples in WM is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>. The FSW tools were made from H13 steel with three-pin angles. In this study, the pin tip radius was kept constant, and 0 • , 30 • , and 60 • were selected for pin angle-the schematic view of FSW tools size presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>.

For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the experimental results from recorded temperature by comparing the experimental results with simulation data. In this section, first, the data from experimental results are analyzed. The experimental results of recorded temperature by thermocouples number 1 and 2 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>.  To find the relation with parts of the tool and generated heat in the simulation model, the area of each part (Shoulder, pin body, and pin tip) was calculated. These areas are in II, and III were 450 • C, 440 • C, and 424 • C, respectively. On the other hand, the recorded temperature in RS of joint lines FSWed by tools I, II, and III were 445 • C, 436 • C, and 421 • C, respectively.</p><p>To find the relation with parts of the tool and generated heat in the simulation model, the area of each part (Shoulder, pin body, and pin tip) was calculated. These areas are in straight contact with WM, and the calculated area for a different part of the tools is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. On the other hand, simulation results of generated heat from various parts of the tool were collected and reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. In this case, it is possible to find the relation between the total area of different tools and total generated heat. The obtained results show that increasing the FSW tool pin angle the total surface of tool decreased. The geometrical analysis shows that the total surface area of Tool I, II, and are 0.04084, 0.04059, and 0.04027, respectively. The numbers show that with increasing tool pin angle, the total area decreased near 1.5% from Tool I to Tool III. These geometric results revealed that with increasing tool pin body, the generated heat by FSW tool shoulder increased, and on the other hand, the total heat generation by pin body decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The geometrical results show that the area of Tool III shoulder is 11% smaller than Tool I shoulder, and the generated heat by Tool III shoulder is 13% lower than Tool I shoulder in simulation. It is notable that with increasing pin angle, the area of the pin body in Tool III increased 26% more than the Tool I pin body.

The simulation results revealed that the heat concentration in AS is higher than RS. Simulation results revealed this heat flow behavior was detected in joints that FSWed with Tool I, Tool II and Tool III. This phenomenon is seen at surface heat flow for FSWed samples with Tool I, II, and III. The generated heat can diffuse equally on the metal surface, but the rotation movement of the FSW tool changes the heat flow with rotation of plasticized metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.

In this case, the hot plasticized aluminum alloy pressed and concentrates in RS and heat flow equality changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5b</ref>). This phenomenon is happened in all cases. The heat distribution in tool III is more uniform comparing others.

Unlike simulation results that maximum heat was generated in front of the tool; the maximum flow velocity is predicted in the middle of RS. It seems, therefore, from the stretching of plasticized materials in the AS and the compression of materials in the RS, that the velocity of materials does not have a linear relation with generated heat <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>for Tool I, Tool II and Tool III is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5c</ref>.

The thermal results were simulated and validated by experimental results. The obtained results can be summarized as follows: 1. The heat generation at a lower pin angle is more than a higher pin angle. With a higher pin angle, the total surface of the tool shoulder and pin that are in contact with the workpiece decrease. For this reason, the frictional heat generation decreases. Due to obtained results, the maximum heat was generated with Tool I (446 °C) and the minimum heat produced by Tool III (416 °C). This difference was created due to the decreasing contact surface of Tool III (0.04027 m 2 ) compared to Tool I (0.04084 m 2 ) with the workpiece. 2. The internal head distributes uniformly at a higher Tool pin angle. Due to the rotational direction of the tool, the materials stretched from AS to RS, and the concentration of plasticized material and heat in the RS was more than in the AS.
