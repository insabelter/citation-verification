<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Prime links with multiple interlocked components feature unconditional topological chirality. Although several prime links have been constructed to date, the control of their chirality with high stereoinduction is rare. Here, we report the stereoselective synthesis of an iconic molecular 6 2 1 link (Star of David [2]catenane) comprising two triply entwined 84-membered rings. The single-handed Star of David catenane is generated from the closure of a hexameric copper(I) circular helicate by ring-closing olefin metathesis, and the topological writhe (w = À6) was predetermined by the configuration of the chiral ligand. Conformation of the topology was proven through NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, whereas the handedness of the link was further investigated through circular dichroism. Stereoselective synthesis of molecular nanotopologies with certain topological writhe by chiral information transfer opens the way to probe the consequences and potential of topological stereochemistry in chemistry, materials, and biology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE BIGGER PICTURE</head><p>A plethora of strategies have been developed for the construction of molecular links since 1960; however, the highly stereoselective synthesis of inherently chiral links is still challenging. A two-step stereoselective preparation of a topologically chiral 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 1 link, in the shape of a Star of David, is presented. Six equivalent of metal-ion templates is employed to drive self-assembly with six chiral building blocks into a helicate scaffold; a suitable bridge is designed between two chelating sites to direct the size of this hexamer; the length and conformational freedom of extended aliphatic olefin chains are modeled to ensure successful metathesis toward the desired connectivity; and the chiral moiety adjacent to the coordination units is placed to secure topological chirality. Such tactics are practically important in molecular nanotopology and create opportunities not only to explore the effects of chemical constitution on topological and tangled materials but also to elucidate the consequences of topological chirality in chemistry and beyond. enables to not only render amphicheiral (topologically achiral in 3D) Borromean rings chiral <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> but also prepare topological chiral molecular knots of single handedness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> Accordingly, if one link is unconditionally topologically chiral, this tactic should also proceed completely stereoselectivity with only one of the two different topological enantiomers being obtained.</p><p>An iconic topology, Star of David [2]catenane (6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 1 link in Alexander-Briggs notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> ) containing two triply interlocked macrocycles is unconditionally topologically chiral (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). Leigh and co-workers reported the elegant synthesis by covalent capture of Lehn-type hexameric circular helicate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> and the inherently chiral links are formed as racemate by using the achiral tris-bipyridine ligand strand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> Although the enantioselective synthesis was achieved later by using a heterometallic helicate, the introduction of unremovable iridium(III) template afforded a metallic link in which the ring dynamic was sacrificed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Different from Lehn-type helicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> which are hard to be functionalized, the introduction of well-developed CHIRAGENs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> may provide a general and efficient method in the construction of high-order knots and links with controlled chirality. The early example by von Zelewsky and co-workers presented a highly stereoselective self-assembly of a hexameric circular helicate by using pinene-bipyridine ligand (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). Both hexamer and tetramer were detected in solution using silver(I) template, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> whereas only hexamer was formed with copper(I) metal ions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> We envisage that this helicate provides an orderly hexagonal entanglement arrangement required for the formation of a Star of David catenane, the suitable alteration of this CHIRAGEN ligand would deliver the construction of the only L-enantiomer of a 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 1 link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Highly stereoselective self-assembly of hexameric circular helicate The ligand frame consists of two pinene-2,2 0 -bipyridine units connected through a xylene bridge. Molecular modeling suggested that a five-atom chain attached to the 4-position of the pinene-bipyridine moiety, i.e., 1, should provide the suitable orientation and positioning to promote joining of the ligand strands with desired connectivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). The chain ends with an alkene so that the ligands can be fused through ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM), and the metal templates can be subsequently removed to leave a wholly organic catenand.</p><p>Chiral ligand 1 was synthesized in six steps from commercially available materials (supplemental information section ''synthesis of ligand 1''). Brief stirring of 1 with an equimolar amount of AgPF 6 in acetonitrile/chloroform (5:1) at room temperature for 30 min followed by the removal of solvent resulted in a white solid (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, step i).</p><p>The 1 H NMR spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>) of the product shows all the ligands to be in equivalent environments. Together with the significant upfield displacement of H a , H b (1.42 ppm) and H 10 (0.35 ppm), this indicated the formation of a highly symmetric circular helicate structure. It is worth to mention that neither broadening at 298 K nor splitting at 233 K of H a and H b signals was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>) comparing with the previous report, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> the results suggest the existence of only one type of helicate after introducing the electron-donating group within 1, rather than two (tetrameric and hexameric circular helicates) rapidly exchanged species. The size of the helicate was further determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Despite the labile nature of silver(I) complexes, weak intensity of m/z peaks confirmed it to be the hexamer L-[Ag 6 1 6 ](PF 6 ) 6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Replacement of AgPF 6 with Cu(MeCN) 4 PF 6 afforded a reddish solid under same condition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, step ii), which was characterized as L-[Cu 6 1 6 ](PF 6 ) 6 by ESI-MS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> H NMR (Figure <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). There is virtually no circular dichroism (CD) signal of ligand 1 in the p-p* (240-320 nm) region of the spectra, obvious CD activity, however, arising from exciton coupling of both helicates (L-[Ag 6 1 6 ](PF 6 ) 6 , Dε 245 nm = +2.0 3 10 6 M À1 cm À1 and L-[Cu 6 1 6 ](PF 6 ) 6 , Dε 245 nm = +0.7 3 10 6 M À1 cm À1 ) could be observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S18</ref>). By comparing with the previous results, we reasoned that the point chirality of the ligand has been effectively transferred into the coordinating complex, and it resulted in an enantiomeric circular helicate with all metal centers featuring L-configuration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> The obtained metallic helicates containing regular hexagonal entanglements should be ideal building blocks for the construction of molecular woven materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> with regular Kagome pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> by having sufficient control of intermolecular connections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formation of Star of David [2]catenate via covalent capture</head><p>Ring closure of L-[Ag 6 1 6 ](PF 6 ) 6 in the presence of Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd catalyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> was proven to be unsuccessful under several conditions, probably due to the sensitivity of silver complex toward chloride-substituted ruthenium catalyst. In contrast, subjecting L-[Cu 6 1 6 ](PF 6 ) 6 to RCM condition, followed by anion exchange with methanolic KPF 6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, steps iii and iv) produced the metallated Star of David [2]catenate L-[Cu 6 2](PF 6 ) 6 (a catenane-metal complex is termed a ''catenate'' and the interlocked metal-free ligand is a catenand, 61 a simulated model of resulted copper(I)- [2]catenate was shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S19</ref>). ESI-MS indicated characteristic distributions of m/z peaks on account of the loss of corresponding PF 6 À after losing six ethene molecules of the L-[Cu 6 2](PF 6 ) 6 (Figures <ref type="figure">S6-S8</ref>). The ''catenand effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> '' improved the stability of resulted copper(I) link and gave significantly increased MS peak intensity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>). The 1 H NMR spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure">3D</ref>) also confirmed the absence of terminal alkene protons and the presence of a broad signal at 5.63 ppm for the internal alkene H e protons. Small amount of polymeric by-product (around 10%-15% according to 1 H NMR integration) was formed and could not be removed from the metallic link through conventional purification process (e.g., re-crystallization, anion exchange, and solvent wash), which is probably due to the decomposition, followed by polymerization of the labile copper(I) helicate under RCM condition.</p><p>The topological writhe (w, also called Tait number <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> ) of a link (knots could be considered special cases of links with one component) is the sum of all signs of its crossing points in a standard projection (projection of the link without nugatory crossing). <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> The obtained number depends only on the link type and is thus a topological invariant of a link. Since only left-handed crossings were generated through chiral transformation, the topological writhe of the resulted [2]catenate was scored as À6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The value is directly determined by the configuration of the asymmetric carbon centers within ligand strand 1. Despite crucial applications of writhe in knot theory and DNA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> the implications of writhe on small-molecule systems are yet to be realized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> The stereoselective synthesis of small molecular topologies with specific topological writhe may deliver a potential strategy to elucidate the mechanisms of such fundamental process in nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wholly organic Star of David [2]catenand</head><p>The [2]catenate was demetallated by treatment of an acetonitrile solution of L-[Cu 6 2](PF 6 ) 6 with aqueous tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na 4 EDTA) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, step v). The color of the solution changed from reddish brown to beige after 30 min, implying the successful removal of copper(I) templates. Two products were isolated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The major product (50%) was characterized as the organic Star of David [2]catenand L-2 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref> and <ref type="figure">S9</ref>), whereas the minor product (20%), which has a molecular mass equal to half that of L-2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S12</ref>), was assigned to be the unlinked macrocycle 3. The formation of macrocycle could be attributed to either the decomposition of labile copper(I) helicate during ring closure or the opening of L-2 triggered by the trace amount of ruthenium species from the ring-closure reaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> The 1 H NMR spectra of L-2 and 3 are very similar (Figures <ref type="figure">3E</ref> and <ref type="figure">3F</ref>), suggesting that the triply entwined macrocycles within the link feature similar chemical environment as the unlinked macrocycle in solution. This could be attributed to the relatively loose conformation and the fast reptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> of ring components within the [2]catenand. Variable-temperature 1 H NMR spectra of L-2 shows little change over the temperature range (243-323 K) which further supports our hypothesis (Figure <ref type="figure">S33</ref>). The diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR (DOSY) showed that L-2 (D = 1.2 3 10 À10 m 2 s À1 ) and 3 (D = 6.0 3 10 À10 m 2 s À1 ) process different diffusion coefficient (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S32</ref> and <ref type="figure">S37</ref>). The interlocked architecture of the [2]catenand was clearly confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry experiments (MS/MS). The parent [L-2+3H] 3+ ion at m/z 1,430.83 was activated by collision induced dissociation, which resulted in multiple charged ions that originate from the link. Two peaks at m/z 715.49 ([M+3H] 3+ ) and 1,072.98 ([M+2H] 2+</p><p>) were detected, corresponding to a structure with half mass of the [2]catanand (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). The results are consistent with the typical fragmentation process of a [2]catenand <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> which breaks one macrocycle and causes the dethreading to form a single ring that remains charged. The organic Star of David [2]catenand L-2 is remetallated by treatment with Cu(MeCN) 4 PF 6 in a dichloromethane/acetonitrile (1:1) mixture at 60 C for 24 h, and the regeneration of the Star of David [2]catenate can be clearly confirmed by both low-resolution (LR)-and high-resolution (HR)-ESI (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S14-S16</ref>). Although the 1 H NMR spectrum of the remetallated link is broader than that of the metallated link obtained from ring closure, most of proton signals are in similar chemical shifts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S13</ref>). Considering that there are 12 chelating vacancies in the organic link, we assume that the ''wrong'' combinations between bipyridine units and copper(I) ions are hard to be corrected due to the slow coordination dynamics. Nevertheless, the reformation of the catenate is a further proof of the formation of the Star of David catenane topology.</p><p>The synthetic availability allows us to further explore the consequences in properties among the uncoordinated ligand strand, unlinked macrocycle and [2]catenand. To directly probe the differences among three compounds, the concentration of ligand and macrocycle are adjusted (c 1 = 6 3 c L-2 , c 3 = 2 3 c L-2 ) by considering the number of chromophores and stereogenic carbon centers in each molecule. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of ligand 1, macrocycle 3, and link L-2 have similar profiles with absorption band at l = 230 (pyridyl n-p*), 257, and 291 nm (bipyridine p-p*) in the expected region for bipyridine units (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). The similar absorbance intensities indicated the chromophores were in similar environment in different topologies, which again supports the results obtained from 1 H NMR.</p><p>The triply entwined 6 2 1 link is unconditionally topologically chiral by virtue of its topology. CD spectra of three compounds all displayed negative Cotton effect. The CD response of macrocycle is slightly lower than that of the ligand, but other than this, the spectra of 1 and 3 are similar, both a reflection of the influence of the chiral centers on the adjacent chromophores. The induced CD signal of the catenand L-2, The concentration of ligand and macrocycle were adjusted on account of the number of chromophores and stereogenic carbon centers in each molecule, so that the absorbance intensity and CD response among three compounds can be directly compared. The UV-vis spectra were presented in dash line, and the CD spectra presented in sloid line. L-2 showed much weaker chiral expression than that of ligand and macrocycle in the range of 220-240 nm.</p><p>however, is noticeably weaker ($0.53) than that of the ligand and macrocycle in the range 220-240 nm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). It should be noted that in the absence of the metal-ion templates, the organic [2]catenand would adapt multiple interconverted dissymmetric and asymmetric conformations through backbone reptation instead of a well-defined D 6 -helical symmetry, which average out to give the CD responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> </p></div>

All three catenanes contain two macrocycles but the rings are entwined with each other in different manner, generating different topologies.

The necessary connections between crossings are directed by introducing a suitable chain at the 4-position of the pinenebipyridine unit, ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM) joins the chain ends in robust C=C bonds, allowing the metal templates to subsequently be removed to leave a wholly organic entangled 6 2</figDesc></figure>

	<note>(PF 6 ) 6 in solid state by X-ray diffraction were proven fruitless. Alternatively, three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) was applied on the obtained nanosized crystals of the hexamer helicate. The inherent property-large dimension and huge void space filled with anion and solvent-makes these compounds protein-like and prevent the collection of high-resolution crystal data that is typical for standard metal complexes. The 3D ED data are at a resolution (2.06 A ˚) that does not allow us to properly completely refine the structure, the simulated model, however, matched with the reconstructed electrostatic potential map (Table S3). Considering the 3D ED has been widely used in solving structures of small-molecule drugs and framework materials, we propose the use of 3D ED characterization combined with structural simulations to determine the specific structure of topologically complex supramolecular architectures. The detail of 3D ED analysis is in supplemental information section &apos;&apos;3D ED data collection and crystal structural analysis</note>
