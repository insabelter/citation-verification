<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Researchers have debated whether methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), with a perovskite crystal structure, is ferroelectric and therefore contributes to the current-voltage hysteresis commonly observed in hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We thoroughly investigated temperature-dependent polarization, dielectric, and impedance spectroscopies, and we found no evidence of ferroelectric effect in a MAPbI3 thin film at normal operating conditions. Therefore, the effect does not contribute to the hysteresis in PSCs, whereas the large component of ionic migration observed may play a critical role. Our temperature-based polarization and dielectric studies find that MAPbI3 exhibits different electrical behaviors below and above ca. 45 o C, suggesting a phase transition around this temperature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly those based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), have shown rapid growth, with efficiencies exceeding 20%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> They are challenging existing silicon-based solar cell technology with their simple solution process, low fabrication cost, and possibilities of stacking with other cells for tandem structures.</p><p>Along with exciting progress in terms of device efficiency, PSCs are also facing issues related to their practical application and are under careful scrutiny. One such issue is the so-called current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis phenomenon that provides a nominal efficiency depending on how the J-V measurement is conducted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Many studies have reported an understanding of the possible nature of the hysteresis mechanism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> such as the ferroelectric effect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ion migration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> trapping of electronic carriers at interfaces, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and others, as was recently reviewed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Each of these proposed mechanisms has strengths and weaknesses in explaining the hysteresis behavior. Further studies are necessary to understand many unresolved issues that may govern J-V hysteresis and to guide the PSC design to overcome this adverse phenomenon.</p><p>Considering the commonly observed ferroelectric property of many inorganic perovskites in their tetragonal phase, it is intriguing to explore whether hybrid perovskites are ferroelectrics that contribute to J-V hysteresis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> From the perspective of perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure, the polarization of MAPbI3 could be due to three components: (1) ionic polarization by the off-center shift of Pb in the PbI6 octahedral, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (2) ionic polarization by the displacement of the positive charge center (MA + ) from the negative charge center (PbI3 -), and (3) the orientation polarization of the MA + dipole. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Conclusions from different publications, based on macroscopic polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> microscopic probing of ferroelectric domains, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> or first-principles calculations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> are still being debated. At least three factors may contribute to this unsolved issue. First, MA + groups at room temperature exhibit strongly dynamic disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> that could invalidate the assumption in the first-principles calculations and lead to zero averaged polarization in a macro scale, even though a dipole moment might be formed at the unit-cell scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Second, as a narrow-bandgap semiconductor, MAPbI3 thin films investigated typically contain a high density of charge carriers with reasonable high mobility. Such samples contribute a large conduction current during polarization measurements that may obscure the observation of a small remnant polarization-if one does exist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Third, the ionic conduction and its related capacitance will further complicate the analysis of the P-E loop. Therefore, further experimental studies are still needed to determine unambiguously if MAPbI3 polycrystalline thin films have a ferroelectric property that could possibly contribute to the J-V hysteresis of PSCs.</p><p>A ferroelectric material shows characteristic signatures in electric-field-dependent polarization studies and temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> For typical perovskitestructure-based ferroelectrics (e.g., perovskite oxide), in the phase transition from the hightemperature paraelectric cubic phase to the low-temperature ferroelectric tetragonal phase, the P-E and the related C-E (C: capacitance) curves also change correspondingly, giving an indication of a paraelectric to ferroelectric transition. The temperature of a MAPbI3 layer in an encapsulated PSC can easily reach more than 60 o C under typical terrestrial operating conditions, while the phase transition of MAPbI3 from a tetragonal to cubic structure occurs in this temperature range. Thus, it is also important to understand the effect of temperature on the possible ferroelectric property change and its impact on the J-V hysteresis behavior. Observation of the P-E loop change across the phase transition may also provide clues in determining whether a ferroelectric feature exists. Various measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> have shown evidence of a MAPbI3 phase change in the broad temperature range of 42 o C~57 o C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Correspondingly, the electrical and optoelectrical properties of perovskites, including the dielectric constant, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> have been reported as having a clear temperature dependence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> However, the polarization response of MAPbI3 perovskite is still unknown in the typical PSC operating temperature range, and a temperature-based polarization study should provide useful information. Moreover, ferroelectric (and antiferroelectric) polar materials also show typical signatures in dielectric spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Particularly, when approaching the phase transition temperature TC from high-temperature paraelectric to low-temperature ferroelectric, the dielectric constant will strongly increase and then decrease again below TC. Therefore, the dielectric constant and loss tangent will exhibit a characteristic peak or jump in their temperature dependence. Thus, temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy provides another approach to verify the possible occurrence of ferroelectricity in hybrid perovskites.</p><p>In this work, we thoroughly investigated a temperature-dependent P-E loop, and we conducted remnant polarization measurements using two different Positive(P)-Up(U)-Negative(N)-Down(D), or PUND, methods. Polarization studies were further corroborated by temperature-dependent impedance and dielectric spectroscopies. All the polarization and dielectric measurements were done under dark condition to exclude the effect of any photo-induced carrier generation or recombination. Even though our macroscale studies could not exclude the possibility of ferroelectricity at nanoscale-and particularly at low temperature-we conclude that MAPbI3 thin films used in PSCs exhibit no apparent ferroelectric property at the normal solar cell operating temperatures (10 o C-70 o C). Therefore, ferroelectricity is not a mechanism that contributes to the J-V hysteresis in PSCs. Temperature-based studies reveal that MAPbI3 exhibits different electrical behaviors below and above ca. 45 o C, suggesting the phase transition around such a temperature.</p><p>We found significant ionic conduction, and we report the activation energies of ionic migration for the two phases. Ionic conduction and its related capacitance contribute to the asymmetric features in the P-E loop. The results unambiguously exclude ferroelectricity as one factor in governing the PSC hysteresis, whereas ionic migration contributes, if not exclusively, to the hysteresis.</p><p>The perovskite solar cell exhibits typical hysteresis in J-V measurements when comparing the data taken from forward scan and reverse scan at various rates. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> in the Supplementary Information (SI), the J-V curves of a typical cell exhibit similar short-circuit current density (Jsc) but less open-circuit voltage (Voc) for forward scans compared to the reverse scans, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 15.78% (reverse scans) to 10.67% (forward scans). To determine if MAPbI3 is a ferroelectric that contributes such hysteresis in PSCs, we studied MAPbI3 thin films directly sandwiched between fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and Au contacts, to avoid the potential effects of hole and electron transport layers in the polarization measurements. After cleaning the FTO glass properly, a perovskite layer was deposited by the anti-solvent method in a spin-coating process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Large crystallites of several hundred nanometers can be noticed from the top view of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging of the perovskite layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The inset is the SEM cross-sectional view of the perovskite layer sandwiched between the FTO and Au contact. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the perovskite film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) also suggests good crystallinity of the material in its tetragonal phase.</p><p>The polycrystalline feature ensures that the ferroelectric polarization will be detected along the out-of-plane (vertical) orientation used in our measurements, if it does exist. For all the measurements, devices from the same batch were used to maintain conformity in various characterizations.</p><p>To determine if MAPbI3 is a ferroelectric material, we first measured its P-E hysteresis loop. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> is the schematic of our experimental setup that measures polarization charges through current integration. Unlike the conventional Sawyer-Tower configuration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>), which may introduce error by the "back voltage" on the sensing capacitor, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> the instrument we used is based on a virtual ground configuration to minimize potential errors. As illustrated schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>, when driven by a triangular waveform pulse, the measured polarization charge in time domain or its dependence on electric field exhibits characteristic profiles for ideal ferroelectrics, dielectrics, and conductors. Their field-dependent differential capacitance, 𝐶𝐶 = 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ⁄ , can also be obtained.  10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 (314) (224) (312) (220) (202) (211) Intensity (arb. unit) 2θ (degree) (110) (112)</p><p>which is also plotted in the same figure. Again, no signatures of ferroelectric capacitance can be identified from the C-E plot. We also did measurements (not shown here) under a voltage of up to 3 V, or a field up to 100 kV/cm, and did not observe any features of nonlinear polarization switching. On the other hand, the parabolic-like shape indicates a dominant conducting current.</p><p>The polarization curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> shows asymmetric behavior, for the positive and negative voltage triangular pulse, i.e., traces 1-2 vs 3-4, and in each triangular pulse, i.e., trace 1 vs 2, and trace 3 vs. 4, unlike the symmetric curve shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3b</ref> for an ideal conductor. In particular, a polarization gap opens up in the loop at 0 V. Such a polarization loop can be approximately simulated by linear resistance and capacitance circuits, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>. In this simulation, we select R1 = 47 kΩ, C1 = 0.26 nF, R2 = 145 kΩ, and C2 = 0.34 μF, the values extracted from impedance measurement that will be discussed later. It is observed that when C1 is connected in parallel to R1, the symmetric mouth-shaped loop of an ideal resistor will be tilted. However, to open up a gap in the loop, a series-connected branch R2 and C2 has to be introduced, which is further connected in parallel with R1//C1. As will be discussed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>, R1 can be modeled as the normal electron-conducting resistance in the MAPbI3 perovskite film (Re), and C1 as the film bulk capacitance (Cbulk), whereas R2 and C2 can be treated as ionic conduction resistance (Rion) and its related capacitance (Cion). From the polarization loop and the capacitance behavior, it is safe to conclude that the measured polarization response comes from a combination of conducting current along with dielectric and other capacitances. No obvious features are observed of a ferroelectric material, either remnant polarization in the P-E loop, or spike in the C-E plot. In addition, we noted that neither changing the frequency nor the applied electric field range results in so-called "S"shaped polarization, which was attributed as a feature of ferroelectric MAPbI3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The same nonferroelectric loop was observed for the Au/MAPbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and thus rules out the dependence of our observation on the device structure. A ferroelectric will become a paraelectric above its Curie temperature. It was reported that P-E measurements conducted at low temperature down to 77 K showed no ferroelectric feature in MAPbI3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> We further measured the polarization in the normal working temperature range (10 ºC-70 ºC) of solar cells to search for any possible ferroelectric features and also clarify the phasetransition effect. In this temperature range, MAPbI3 experiences phase transition from tetragonal to cubic crystal structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>), with a reported phase-transition temperature in a broad range between 42 o C-57 o C lacking a very sharp transition behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> The temperature-dependent P-E loops are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>. Again, no ferroelectric behavior can be identified. As temperature increases, the measured polarization charges increase as conducting current becomes large, but their parabolic profiles have no change. This suggests that from the high-temperature cubic crystal structure to the low-temperature tetragonal structure, a transition from paraelectric to ferroelectric does not occur. Despite no sharp boundary, we observed that for temperatures below ca. 40 o C, polarization charges only increase slightly with temperature, whereas above that temperature, this increment rate becomes larger. We attribute this phenomenon to the crystal phase transition of MAPbI3 perovskite that results in conductivity and capacitance change. To quantify the measured charge change with temperature, the charge generated between 0 to 1.2 V, ∆Q, and polarization gap at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(d</ref> The ferroelectric polarization from MAPbI3 could be small, if it does exist. Therefore, its contribution in the P-E loop may be hidden in the dominant effect of conducting current, and may not be identified easily from the above polarization measurement. To further detect the possible ferroelectric polarization, we explored two different PUND methods. The conventional PUND method using sine pulses is shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure">S6a</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> In this technique, the charge contributed from the conduction current is assumed to be the same with a small value for the P and U pulses; therefore, during pulse U, only the conduction charge is measured, which is deducted from the total charge measured in pulse P to obtain the remnant polarization Pr. The same is true for the N and D pulses. Using this method, the measured results at room temperature are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S6b</ref>. A zero remnant polarization charge was measured.</p><p>Conduction current could have hysteresis. So for more accurate PUND measurement without assuming equal conducting current in the two pulses, we further adopted the approach in Ref. 33, which is shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>, where driving pulses are in rectangular shape (constant field). For a leaky ferroelectric, the measured polarization charge consists of ferroelectric polarization PF, dielectric polarization PD, and charges from conduction current flow QC. Here, a negative poling pulse (not shown) was first applied to initialize the sample into the state of -PF.</p><p>The driving P pulse causes an abrupt ferroelectric polarization inversion that generates a total polarization charge of 2PF in the sensing circuit; it remains constant until a negative pulse (not shown) is applied. The P pulse also abruptly produces a constant dielectric polarization PD that disappears at the end of each pulse. Here, PT is defined as the sum of 2PF and PD. In the duration of the P pulse, the field also produces a conduction current through the sample, generating a timedependent QC. For the very leaky MAPbI3 sample, the transient period for capacitive charging will be much shorter; on the other hand, the possible ionic screening effect may be neglected on a timescale of sub-milliseconds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Therefore, a constant conduction current will produce a linearly increased QC with time. As shown schematically, from the measured response, which is the sum of three polarization contributions, ferroelectric polarization can be determined as PF = (PT -PD)/2 from a single pulse measurement. Our measured results, with sub-millisecond driving pulses, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>. Again, a trivial ferroelectric polarization, with an upper limit of 5 nC/cm 2 , which is comparable with noise level, was measured for both P and U pulses. Furthermore, neither the temperature-dependent measurement nor voltage-dependent measurement, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>, suggests the existence of a ferroelectric component.  Further, we measured the impedance spectra (Fig. S8) of the sample in a temperature range of 10 o C-70 o C, from which we derived the frequency-dependent dielectric constant(𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′ ), dielectric loss(𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′′ ), loss tangent (𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′′ /𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′ ), and conductivity (𝜎𝜎 ′ ). To find the possible presence of ferroelectric behavior, temperature dependence of dielectric constant and loss tangent at several selected frequencies are plotted in Fig 4a.</p><p>It is known that a peak in dielectric constant and loss tangent is a characteristic of a ferroelectric material when crossing its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition (Tc). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> However, no such peaks, either sharp or broad, were found in the temperature suggesting the phase change across the regions. The temperature dependence of dielectric loss and conductivity (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>) also suggests a phase transition between 40 o C-50 o C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref> shows frequency spectra of dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and loss tangent. Unusually high values of 𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′ , similar to those in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , can be seen at low frequencies (970 at 1 Hz and 30 o C), which dramatically decrease by more than one order at higher frequencies. Such a strong dependence of dielectric permittivity, particularly at low frequencies, is not a favorable sign of a ferroelectric nature of the material. At low frequencies, the value of 𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′ increases with temperature, whereas at high frequencies the trend is opposite but at a much smaller rate. This low-/high-frequency boundary is at ~10 3 Hz for our MAPbI3 thin film. The dielectric loss 𝜀𝜀 𝑟𝑟 ′′ shows a 1/f behavior for frequencies below a few kHz, following the so-called Jonscher's law, which accurately reveals the ionic conductivity of the material. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> As temperature increases, a small and wide shoulder (indicated by the arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>) begins to appear and shifts toward higher frequency with temperature. Such a behavior is typical for relaxation processes, found in the generic Debye expression of permitivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Considering the low frequency and broad peak feature, this relaxation process could be a Maxwell-Wagner type interfacial polarization relaxation, possibly attributed to grain boundary effects or blocking at the contacts. The dielectric loss tangent of the material was found to be high at lower frequencies, especially at lower temperature. The peak value of loss tangent shifts toward higher frequency as the temperature is increased (~1 Hz for 10 o C to ~200</p><p>Hz for 70 o C). Moreover, the loss tangent starts increasing with temperature at &gt;100 Hz, and below this frequency the loss tangent decreases with increasing temperature. More work is expected to be done in the future to understand this phenomenon.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>, the Nyquist plots of impedance spectra exhibit two distinct chargetransport regimes associated with two semicircles. This is particularly obvious at higher temperatures. The first semicircle in the high-frequency regime arises from fast electron transport, whereas the second semicircle in the low-frequency regime may be attributed to slow ionic migration to the contact interface. Different models have been applied to fit the spectra to gain insight on the physical processes. Here, we employ the model previously used by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and Beilsten-Edmands et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> in their studies of perovskite materials, to explain our measured data. It is understood that this simplified model will not capture all the subtleties but does explain the dominant processes. As shown by the equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>), this model considers contributions from both electrons and mobile ions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Here, Re represents electronic resistances, and Arrhenius plot of the extracted ionic conductivity is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>, from which the thermal activation energy for ionic conductivity in the MAPbI3 sample was derived. In the low-temperature tetragonal phase, an activation energy for ionic migration was found to be 0.69 ± 0.02 eV, whereas it was 0.47 ± 0.06 eV in the high-temperature cubic phase. Our results are roughly in line with recent calculations by Eames et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> who reported a migration activation energy for I -vacancy of 0.58 eV and for MA + of 0.84 eV, and by Haruyama et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> who reported values of 0.44 and 0.57 eV, respectively, in a tetragonal cell. In another study, Azpiroz et al. 11 calculated 0.5 eV for MA + ion migration. We further noticed that Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> experimentally measured an activation energy of 0.43 eV, attributed to I -migration. But these theoretical and experimental studies did not report the activation energy differences between two phases. We speculate that the two different slopes (two different activation energies) in the Arrhenius plot were caused by the phase transition with cell volume change and atomic configuration distortion. Interestingly, it is further noticed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref> that the electronic conductivity increases in the cubic phase more dramatically when compared to the tetragonal phase, suggesting a larger bandgap in the cubic phase. It was previously reported that the bandgap may be reduced from the tetragonal phase to cubic phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> However, our reflection spectra-based measurements, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S12</ref>, indicate a positive bandgap change with temperature dEg/dT, in contrasting to most common semiconductors. This phenomenon was recently reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Although there is no clear-cut phase transition from the bandgap measurement, we can still observe a larger dEg/dT in the high-temperature regime (cubic phase).</p><p>Ferroelectrics exhibit essential characteristic signatures in field-dependent polarization measurements and in temperature-dependent dielectric spectra across the phase transition.</p><p>However, in our systematic polarization measurements and dielectric spectroscopic study, no signatures were detected; but we found significant ionic conduction. Our results suggest that MAPbI3 thin films do not exhibit ferroelectricity at a macroscale in the normal solar cell working temperature range. Other reports at low temperature 31 also did not find any ferroelectric characteristic. Recent theoretical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> suggest that for MAPbI3, the off-center motion of Pb in the PbI6 octahedral is trivial, in contrast to previous calculations that included a large off-center motion component; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> therefore, only a small ferroelectric polarization could exist, contributed mainly by MA + group. However, the dynamic orientation disorder of the MA + group at normal operating temperatures may result in an average zero polarization at a macro scale, even though a dipole moment may exist in a unit cell or at nanoscale. Our different measurements confirm that no net remnant polarization exists in MAPbI3 thin film at macroscales in the PSC normal operating temperature range. Therefore, the hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs is not caused by a ferroelectric effect, but most likely is a result of ionic migration-related processes, with or without electron trapping. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> To gain further insight on the relationship between ionic conductivity and PSC hysteresis, temperature-dependent J-V curve hysteresis of PSC was measured, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S13</ref>, indicating the hysteresis decreases when the temperature is increased from 20 to 70 o C. This observation agrees with two recent studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and is consistent with our observed faster ionic migration at higher temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>), further suggesting the critical role of ionic migration in PSC hysteresis.</p><p>In summary, we studied polarization, dielectric, and impedance spectroscopies of MAPbI3 perovskite at the normal operating temperature range. We found that large conduction currents and capacitive effects govern the measured polarization charges in MAPbI3 thin films, along with a small contribution from dielectric polarization. Polarization depends on temperature and shows clear evidence of phase transition. A set of thorough macroscale polarization measurements, corroborated by temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopic study, reveals the absence of ferroelectricity in MAPbI3 thin films under normal solar cell operating conditions. Therefore, ferroelectricity is not a factor contributing to the PSC hysteresis problem, but ionic migration, with or without electron trapping, should be a key factor contributing to the hysteresis. Temperaturedependent studies find that MAPbI3 exhibits different polarization, dielectric, and electrical behaviors below 40 o C and above 50 o C, suggesting the phase transition from tetragonal to cubic structure across this temperature range. The activation energies of ionic migration, most likely the migration of I -vacancies, are reported for the two phases. This study will improve our understanding of MAPbI3 material properties and may also provide useful information on the ultimate solution of hysteresis-free PSCs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The fitting curves to the original measurements are shown in Fig. S10. After plotting the various ionic and electronic elements of the equivalent circuit against temperature, we observed a clear change of Rion and Re resistivity as shown in Fig. S11. Cion also showed one order of change from 10 o C to 70 o C whereas Cbulk did not change significantly. Two different regimes for all these four parameters, although with weak contrast, can still be differentiated. This gives an indication of a soft phase transition at a temperature between 40 o C and 50 o C, consistent with the measurement of polarization. Both these results confirm a similar trend of charge-conduction change between two phases. The</figDesc></figure>
