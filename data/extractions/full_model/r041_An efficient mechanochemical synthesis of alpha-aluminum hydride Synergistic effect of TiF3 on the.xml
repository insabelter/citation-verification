			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A C T α-AlH 3 is one of the most promising hydrogen storage materials due to its high gravimetric hydrogen capacity and low dehydriding temperature. In present work, a convenient and cost-efficient solid-state mechanochemical reaction is proposed to obtain α-AlH 3 nano-composite. With the addition of TiF 3 , α-AlH 3 nano-composite was formed in a short period by milling of LiH and AlCl 3 . Based on XRD and NMR results, the average grain size of the α-AlH 3 in the nano-composite was 45 nm. The reaction pathway as well as the synergistic effect of TiF 3 on the solid state reaction between LiH and AlCl 3 were confirmed. In the α-AlH 3 /LiCl nano-composite, TiF 3 reduced the temperature of dehydriding reaction and improved dehydrogenation rate of α-AlH 3 . Within the temperature range between 80 and 160 °C, dehydrogenation of the as-milled α-AlH 3 nano-composite showed fast kinetics. At 160 °C, a maximum hydrogen desorption of 9.92 wt% was obtained within 750 s, very close to the theoretical hydrogen capacity of α-AlH 3 .</p></div>

AlH 3 completely decomposes with a desirable rate at relatively low temperatures (100-200 °C), which is essential for the compatibility requirements with proton-exchange membrane fuel cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. AlH 3 releases hydrogen leaving only metallic Al, a residue that is convenient to recycle.

All but α-polymorph are metastable at ambient conditions. α-AlH 3 is the most studied polymorph because of the high stability. It is stable at room temperature but thermodynamically unstable at 150 °C under 10 kbar <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Although AlH 3 has many promising attributes, it is still not fully utilized as a hydrogen storage material, mainly because of the lack of an efficient and convenient industrial production method. Until 1976, the most popular methods to prepare AlH 3 polymorphs were the wet chemical synthesis proposed by Brower et al. It involved LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 as the starting materials and LiBH 4 as a desolvation aid, and ether as the solvent. Alane-ether complexes form according to Eq. (1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3LiAlH 4 + AlCl 3 + nEt 2 O → 4AlH 3 •nEt 2 O + 3LiCl<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Bulychev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> later modified this method and synthesized AlH 3 by reacting lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH 4 ) with a strong acid like sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) in ether, with crystallization from diethyl ether-benzene solution (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2LiAlH 4 + H 2 SO 4 → 2AlH 3 + Li 2 SO 4 + 2H 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In general, AlH 3 can be synthesized from alkali and/or alkaline earth metal tetrahydroaluminates, or hydrides based on wet chemical reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> through the formation of alane-ether complexes. However, despite being less expensive and/or very reactive, these methods of α-AlH 3 synthesis involve large amounts of environmentally harmful organic solvents, and are highly sensitive to temperature and time. It is impractical to handle volatile organic liquids and the methods are not suitable for large-scale AlH 3 production. Thus, a solvent-free synthesis yielding non-solvated and adduct-free AlH 3 is highly desirable.</p><p>Saitoh reported synthesis of adduct-free AlH 3 by hydrogenation of Al (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. However, this method can only be accomplished under H 2 pressure with at least 10 GPa at 25 °C because of the stabilizing surface aluminum oxide layer or low diffusivity of hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Saitoh also demonstrated a H 2 pressure as high as 6 GPa at 300-800 °C could be used to perform efficient Al hydrogenation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Thermodynamically, hydrogenation of Al to obtain AlH 3 is not a preferred method. Thus, such high pressures during AlH 3 synthesis make this method less attractive for large-scale AlH 3 synthesis. 2Al +3H 2 → 2AlH 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> Mechanochemical method is a well-known technique, which is green and sustainable and offers several economic benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. It was demonstrated by several groups that this process can be solvent-free and consumes less energy comparing to solvent-based reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Thus, mechanochemical method is gaining attention as an alternative to conventional solution-based processes and was proposed to synthesize metal hydrides by solid-state reactions with ball milling <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. For example, Fernandez studied milling processes of LiAlH 4 with different metal halides (VCl 3 , VBr 3 and AlCl 3 ) and observed AlH 3 formation by a mechanochemical reaction between LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. To date, mechanochemical milling has been successfully used for the solid-state synthesis of AlH 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Mechanochemical method for AlD 3 synthesis was employed by Brinks <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. AlD 3 mixture of various polymorphs was synthesized by mechanically-assisted reaction between LiAlD 4 and AlCl 3 at 77 K and room temperature (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">4</ref>)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">3LiAlD 4(s) + AlCl 3(s) → 4AlD 3 +3LiCl<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Lately, Paskevicius obtained a mixture of several polymorphs of AlH 3 (α-, α'-, and γ) by a mechanochemical reaction of LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The final crystalline size of AlH 3 was 15-17 nm. Sartori reported that the yield of (α+α')-AlH 3 increased from 6.1-49.9 mol% when NaAlH 4 +AlCl 3 and LiAlD 4 +AlBr 3 were used as reagents (see Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">6</ref>)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">3LiAlD 4 + AlBr 3 → 4AlD 3 + 3LiBr (5) 3NaAlH 4 + AlCl 3 → 4AlH 3 + 3NaCl<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Prior studies mainly focused on mechanochemical method for AlH 3 composite synthesis rather than the selective synthesis of certain polymorphs during mechanochemically activated reaction process.</p><p>Ti and its halides are well-known as effective catalysts for the synthesis of various hydrides. However, most of previous research focused on the effect of Ti-based additives on hydrogen sorption or desorption properties on/from the hydrogen storage materials. For example, Ma demonstrated that presence TiF 3 significantly enhanced dehydrogenation of MgH 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Ismail confirmed catalytic role of Ti-containing compounds for performance of NaAlH 4 -TiF 3 system and promotes dehydrogenation of NaAlH 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Balema <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> recently demonstrated synthesis of Li 3 AlH 6 using solid state reaction at ambient temperatures, which proceeded faster with addition of TiCl 4 . Moreover, Sartori <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> added FeF 3 to the cryomilled LiAlD 4 /AlCl 3 mixture to accelerate nucleation of the as-milled product and alter its α/α'-AlH 3 ratio. This could be attributed to the isostructure between FeF 3 and α'-AlH 3 which may lead to larger amount of α'-AlH 3 in the as-milled product <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Because TiF 3 and α-AlH 3 have similar structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, it is possible that fine TiF 3 crystals may act as nucleation seeds for α-AlH 3 formation.</p><p>In this work, we studied formation of α-AlH 3 by the mechanochemical process. We used solid-state reaction to obtain AlH 3 by milling using cheaper AlCl 3 and metal hydrides as starting materials. Without solvent addition, the separation is omitted and the cost of production can be reduced effectively. We introduced TiF 3 into LiH/ AlCl 3 reaction system to facilitate nucleation of α-AlH 3 . This preliminary finding demonstrates that the usage of TiF 3 during mechanochemical process may be beneficial to the formation of nano-sized α-AlH 3 . This simple and efficient synthesis of α-AlH 3 for the first time offers a complete suppression of the parasitic formation of metallic Al. Moreover, the high selectivity of form makes it convenient for further extraction. Meanwhile we systematically studied effect of TiF 3 on the ball-milling assisted reaction rates as well as the underlying mechanisms of the TiF 3 -assisted nucleation of α-AlH 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental</head><p>The Gibbs free energy of the reaction between LiH and AlCl 3 with a range of 273-380 K is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>. The calculation of Gibbs free energy has been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The Gibbs free energy for the reaction (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)) at 298 K is about -269 kJ/mol, and therefore the reaction can proceed at room temperature.</p><p>3 LiH + AlCl 3 → AlH 3 + 3LiCl <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> The starting materials LiH (97%), AlCl 3 (99%) and TiF 3 (98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich for synthesis of α-AlH 3 composite. The materials, LiH, AlCl 3 and TiF 3 were used as-received for this research. The materials were analyzed shortly prior to the use. Purity of materials can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref> in ESI. Because of potential sensitivity to moisture, reagents were handled and stored in sealed vials in Ar-filled glove box. Oxygen and water levels in a glove box were &gt; 5 ppm. In an Ar-filled glove box, the reagents, LiH/AlCl 3 as well as TiF 3 were weighed and mixed in the various molar ratios firstly. The mixtures were subsequently sealed in a high-pressure ball milling canister for use. Ambient temperature milling was performed using planetary QM-SP4 mixer containing custom-built high-pressure 500 cm 3 stainless steel (316) canister <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Each canister was sealed on both ends using an o-ring. Milling balls were made from stainless steel 316. The containers were evacuated and filled with H 2 or Ar to a designated pressure ranging between 5 and 40 MPa. Different ranges of milling parameters, such as ball to powder mass ratio, milling speed and gas pressure, were explored to obtain different reaction products. Thus, ball milling was performed for variable durations with different speeds between 100 and 400 rpm. Ball to powder weight ratios were 40:1, 80:1, 120:1 and 200:1. To ensure that average temperatures in the milling vials were close to room temperature, the milling procedure involved alternating milling directions every 20 min. Between every 20 min the milling was discontinued for 10 min. After completion of the mechanochemical reaction, the as-milled product was obtained and collected from vials for further analysis.</p><p>For the isothermal desorption measurements, the as-milled samples were loaded into a stainless holder and sealed in an Argon-atmosphere glove box. The hydrogen desorption experiments were carried out in a vacuum apparatus, from which the temperature range from 25 °C to the specified temperature at a vacuum up to 1 × 10 -2 Pa. To investigate the dehydriding property of α-AlH 3 composite, the as-milled products were heated in a vacuum chamber from room temperature to different temperatures (80, 120, 140 and 160 °C). The time required for the full dehydriding reaction was fixed within 6500 s, respectively. Once the amounts of hydrogen decomposed from the composite were measured, the vial vacuum change in chamber can be calculated, the corresponding the contents of AlH 3 in its composite could be obtained according to the ideal gas equation as well as stoichiometric weight of AlH 3 calculated by the chemical reaction.</p><p>The samples for X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and solid-state NMR were also prepared in the glove box. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by a Philips X'PERT diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromator with a rotating anode tube and operated with Cu Ka radiation source. The voltage and tube current were 45 kV and 40 mA. The samples were scanned from 10 to 90°at 0.5°/min. The average grain size of the α-AlH 3 in the composite was obtained by XRD analysis and the following Scherrer formula.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= D k cos (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>Where D is the average grain size, k a constant of 0.89, λ and β the X-ray wavelength and the half-width, θ the diffraction angle. The as-milled product was placed on carbon tape, coated with a thin layer of gold (Au) by sputtering (EMITECH K450X) and then observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG). The solidstate NMR spectra were collected with a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer, equipped with a wide bore 14.1 T magnet and a magic angle spinning probe head for rotors of 2.5 mm diameter. To protect the samples from moisture, all samples were packed into a 2.5 mm ZrO 2 rotor and sealed with a tight fitting kel-F cap. NMR shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm). Moreover, this shift was referenced externally with potassium alum to -0.033 ppm, and recycle delay for 27 Al was set to 3 s. TEM was conducted on a Tecnai G2 F30 instrument operating at 200 kV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Mechanochemical synthesis</head><p>Solid-state mechanochemical reaction of Li hydride and AlCl 3 is regarded as a green pathway for producing adduct-free AlH 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Brinks reported that ball milling mixture of LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 generates mainly Al and LiCl, with small amounts of α-AlH 3 and α′-AlH 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Gupta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> suggested that gas pressure affects decomposition of the metastable hydrides into the metal and hydrogen under the mechanochemical conditions. To prevent AlH 3 from decomposing during the ball milling and to find an efficient and cost-effective mechanochemical process for α-AlH 3 synthesis, we conducted LiH/AlCl 3 reaction under various hydrogen pressures. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows XRD patterns of the LiH and AlCl 3 mixture (with a 3:1 M ratio) milled for 1 h at various hydrogen pressures. Ball-to-powder weight ratio (BPR) and rotation speed were 120:1 and 300 rpm, respectively. LiH/AlCl 3 mixture milled under 10 MPa of hydrogen pressure demonstrated only XRD peaks belonging to the metallic Al, LiCl and unreacted LiH. Thus, the following reaction occurred during the ball milling Eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">3LiH + AlCl 3 → 3LiCl + Al + 1.5H 2 (9)</formula><p>Under higher hydrogen pressures, AlH 3 XRD peaks were not observed as well. These results are consistent with the ones obtained by Hlova <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, who also found that replacing AlH 3 with metallic Al resulted in LiH and AlCl 3 during ball-milling under 30 MPa hydrogen pressure. Paskevicius elaborated that high-energy milling at room temperature might be needed for AlH 3 dehydrogenation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Although local temperatures are often quite high during high-energy ball milling, such temperature spikes are generally very brief. Moreover, each vial has enough time to cool down during paused milling cycles. Considering kinetic stabilization of AlH 3 at room temperature, raising temperature by a few degrees should not decompose AlH 3. The final product obtained after 1 h milling under 40 MPa of hydrogen pressure was light grey in color and consisted of α-and α′-AlH 3 as well as LiCl, LiH and LiAlCl 4 with no metallic Al. Grain sizes of α and α′ AlH 3 phases were up to 83 and 87 nm, respectively. Thus, we conclude that α and α′-AlH 3 phases transformed into their corresponding nano-crystalline forms.</p><p>To explore whether the milling parameters, especially milling intensity, were related to the formation of metallic Al, we decreased rotation speed from 300 to 100 rpm. BPR was also reduced from 120:1 to 40:1. The hydrogen pressure was set at 10 MPa. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the XRD patterns of products synthesized by milling LiH/LiCl mixture with various ratios for 1 h. At 300 rpm and 80:1 ratio, intensities of LiH and AlCl 3 XRD peaks are bigger, suggesting a lower reaction rate. However, metallic Al was formed in these as-milled samples. As the ratio was further reduced to 40:1, diffraction peaks of LiH and AlCl 3 were observed. Complete reaction of LiH and AlCl 3 with metallic Al as a product was not achieved during the final milling stage. Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref> shows XRD results of the as-milled LiH/LiCl mixture milled at various rotation speeds with the same milling time. The results were the same as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: only Al, LiCl, unreacted LiH and AlCl 3 diffraction peaks were observed. Although the rotation speed and the BPR have large impacts on the kinetics of the reaction, these parameters cannot suppress formation of metallic Al during mechanochemical reaction between LiH and AlCl 3 under a lower hydrogen pressure at room temperature. Thus, pressure is more influential on the mechanochemical synthesis of AlH 3 than milling intensity. Therefore, control of the reaction by changing the pressure during the reaction may be feasible to obtain pure phase of AlH 3 .</p><p>Despite the fact that hydrogen pressure has such a dramatic influence on the mechanochemical reaction outcome, pressure applied in this work was too high to be used in large-scale AlH 3 production. Mechanically activated solid-gas reactions were studied by several groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, and many of them confirmed that no gas-solid exchanges occur during mechanochemical reaction of LiAlH 4 /AlCl 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, NaAlH 4 /AlCl 3 and LiH/AlCl 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Thus, mechanochemical reaction of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture can also be performed in other inert atmospheres, such as Ar. Therefore, we performed mechanochemical reaction between LiH and AlCl 3 (the molar ratio is 3:1) at 300 rpm with BPR of 120:1 for 1 h under various Ar pressures. XRD patterns of the products are very similar to those prepared by milling the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture under 10-30 MPa hydrogen pressure (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). XRD peaks attributable to metallic Al were observed in samples milled in Ar at 5 MPa. When Ar pressure was 10 MPa, in contrast to the mechanochemical reaction under H 2 , unreacted LiH, α, α′-AlH 3 , LiCl and LiAlCl 4 instead of metallic Al were observed. Thus, pressure is a critical factor that efficiently suppresses formation of Al during the ball milling of LiH/AlCl 3 mixture. The value of the critical pressure decreases as the gas molecular weight increases, demonstrating that the critical pressure is related to the physical properties of the ambient atmosphere. During the mechanochemical reaction in the LiH-AlCl 3 system at 10-15 MPa, the reaction process did not accelerate based on the XRD results. Complete reaction of LiH and AlCl 3 was not achieved by milling the Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. XRD patterns of LiH and AlCl 3 with a molar ratio of 3:1 milled at 300 rpm with various BPR for 1 h. The hydrogen pressure was 10 MPa. mixture for 1 h, where unreacted LiH was observed in the final milled product. Therefore, this serves as evidence that the increment in critical pressure is not important to obtain a lower reaction rate, which is more likely controlled by the milling intensity.</p><p>It was demonstrated by several groups that the rotation speed and BPR are important parameters in the mechanochemical process. They effectively enhances the chemical reactivity between the reagents, increase the kinetics of the reaction and deduce the time of reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. To accelerate mechanochemical reaction of LiH/AlCl 3 and obtain AlH 3 composite in a short milling time, the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture (the molar ratio is 3:1) was milled at 400 rpm with a BPR 200:1 in Ar at 10 MPa with different milling times. When milling time was 0.5 h, LiH and AlCl 3 XRD peaks disappeared (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), indicating acceleration of the mechanochemical reaction rate as the milling intensity increased. Additionally, peaks attributable to LiAlCl 4 and α-and α′-AlH 3 phase were observed in the sample milled for 1 h. Thus, a complete reaction with the formation of α-AlH 3 was not achieved. Phases observed after 3 h milling were the same as those obtained by milling LiH/AlCl 3 mixture for 1 h but intensity of AlH 3 peaks increases with milling time. Upon milling for 5 diffraction peaks of the intermediate LiAlCl 4 were still observed. However, its peak between 10°and 20°broadened significantly, indicating formation of an amorphous intermediate compound. Although the BPR and rotation speed accelerate reaction kinetics, it is difficult for LiH/AlCl 3 mixture to form AlH 3 nano-composite within 5 h of the mechanochemical reaction. Based on calculation, the average grain size of α-AlH 3 can get 124 nm. Thus, it was ineffective to achieve a complete reaction to generate AlH 3 by increasing reaction intensity. Moreover, formation of different polymorphs of AlH 3 will ultimately lead to the complexity of the hydrogen extraction. This mechanochemical method is considered environmentally friendly because no solvents were used during the whole milling process. This method, involving a addition of AlCl 3 into LiH, is a simple way to synthesize α-AlH 3 nano-composite. This method may not be fully applicable to the LiH-AlCl 3 system, which was confirmed by our in-depth investigation on formation of α-AlH 3 during short milling periods. Fig. 4. XRD patterns of the LiH and AlCl 3 with a molar ratio of 3:1 milled at 400 rpm with a BPR 200:1 in Ar at 10 MPa for different milling times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Effect of TiF 3 on mechanochemical reaction</head><p>Sartori demonstrated that FeF 3 not only accelerated nucleation of the as-milled metal hydride <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, but also affected crystalline structure during cryo-milling processes. TiF 3 can act as a seed crystal for formation of α-AlH 3 . To investigate the influence of TiF 3 effect on the reaction rate of the mechanochemical reaction of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture and crystallization of the AlH 3 more clearly, we studied XRD patterns of products of mechanochemical reactions of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixtures with the presence of the TiF 3 powder at a 3:1:0.1 M ratio milled at 400 rpm with a BPR 200:1 in Ar at 10 MPa for 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 h (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). After milling for 0.5 h, LiH and AlCl 3 XRD peaks disappeared, however, complete conversion of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture into AlH 3 and LiCl phases did not occur. Similar diffraction peaks were observed when TiF 3 was not added. Thus, TiF 3 could not accelerate diffusion rate between LiH and AlCl 3 after 0.5 h of ball-milling. XRD pattern of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture after milling for 1 h contained LiAlCl 4 and α-AlH 3 peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>), indicating that crystallization of amorphous phases (formed during the first 30 min of ball-milling) occurred within the second 30 min. Thus, TiF 3 can induce quick crystallization of the product from the amorphous phases resulting in α-AlH 3 phase. After ball-milling for 3 h, diffraction peaks of the intermediate phases, such as LiAlCl 4 , disappeared, leaving only α-AlH 3 and LiCl phases in the final product. As the milling time was increased to 5 h, no substantial changes in the XRD patterns were observed comparing to the products obtained after 3 h milling. However, peak intensity at ˜30°decreased suggesting formation of nano-sized α-AlH 3 . The average grain size of α-AlH 3 formed after 5 h milling with the presence of TiF 3 was up to 45 nm. Thus, TiF 3 addition into the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture can induce nano-sized α-AlH 3 formation with much smaller crystallite size than without TiF 3 . Crystallization rate and selective formation of only α-AlH 3 polymorph occurs because of the synergetic mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Analysis of the mechanochemical process</head><p>To better understand the mechanochemical process, LiH/AlCl 3 /TiF 3 mixtures (molar ratio 3:1:0.1) milled at 400 rpm with a BPR of 200:1 for various times were analyzed by SEM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). Milling for 0.5 h did not reduce particle sizes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6a</ref>). Moreover, a large amount of agglomerates formed with irregular shapes, which can be attributed to the brittleness of the rods. Average particle size of the mixture milled for 0.5 h was ˜40 μm. After 1 h milling, significant amount of large agglomerates were still present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6b</ref> and <ref type="figure">c</ref>), with finer individual particles adhered to the agglomerates. After 3 h milling, only fine particles were observed with no agglomerates. With longer milling time, the powders became granular in shape with uniform size distribution. The average particle size of the sample milled for 5 h is smaller than 1 μm, which is in agreement with the XRD analysis.</p><p>We also analyzed milled samples by 27 Al NMR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>). Hlova et al. observed an NMR peak centered at ˜-2 ppm for the mixtures milled for 8 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. They attributed this peak to AlCl 3 . However, we observed no AlCl 3 , likely because AlCl 3 was consumed after 0.5 h of milling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7a</ref>). Instead, we observed a dominant spectral band at ˜95 ppm. It was demonstrated by Hlova that the peak at ˜95 ppm is attributed to the four-coordinated Al <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The four-coordinated Al signal may be assigned to a superposition of the central transition powder patterns from LiAlCl 4 or LiAlH 4 . With the above XRD analysis, this band corresponds to the four-coordinated Al in LiAlCl 4 , which is the intermediate product. The same results were observed using DPMAS spectra obtained by Hlova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These results also agree with our XRD analysis. With 1 h milling, NMR spectrum also confirmed the presence of LiAlCl 4 but the peak intensity was smaller. NMR spectrum of sample milled for 1 h exhibited broad peaks around at ˜33 ppm and ˜6 ppm (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7b</ref>), indicating formation of the 6-coordinated Al. The amorphous intermediate products might have more than one Al species because Li-Al-H and Al-H both have priorities in the formation during the mechanochemical reaction. However, the coordinated Al species in Li-Al-H is different from that in Al-H. Grubisic demonstrated that for the other aluminum hydride clusters such as Al x H x+2 (3 ≤ × ≤ 8), the polyhedral structure of Al-H cannot be formed with six polymorphic modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Thus, it can be deduced that polymers Al-H x (x = 1, 2, 3 the coordinated Al species is six polymorphic modification) in an amorphous state was formed during the milling process. After milling for 3 h, LiAlCl 4 NMR peak disappeared (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7c</ref>), thus, it is very likely that LiAlCl 4 as an intermediate product were entirely consumed in the reaction. Additionally, peak corresponding to the 6-coordinated Al changed significantly, which was due to the phase conversion of the intermediate products during extended milling. Thus, NMR can be used as an indicator of the mechanochemical reaction termination. Humphries and Hwang associated the resonance bands at ˜6.0 ppm with the α-AlH 3 phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Thus, after milling for only 60 min, only α-AlH 3 was observed in the product. Therefore, TiF 3 induced crystallization of the amorphous phase and accelerated crystallization of the α-AlH 3 phase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Reaction and synergetic mechanism</head><p>Even though we thoroughly analyzed solid-state mechanochemical reaction by XRD and NMR, the actual details of the reaction mechanism and synergistic effect of TiF 3 were still somewhat unclear. Typically, AlH 3 /LiCl composite can form directly during the milling process and mechanism of the AlH 3 formation during this process is similar to the one reported by Paskevicius <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>. XRD results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) indicated that metallic Al instead of AlH 3 formed during the milling process. To investigate the mechanism for the Al formation during ball milling of LiH/AlCl 3 , this mechanochemical reaction was controlled by a stepwise reduction of Ar pressure. The as-milled LiAlCl 4 /LiCl composites comes from 3:1:0.1 LiH:AlCl 3 :TiF 3 mixture at 400 rpm under a 10 MPa Ar atmosphere, with a BPR of 200:1 for 0.5 h milling conditions were used as the original compounds to be milled at a lower gas pressure. During the second stage milling Ar pressure was reduced to 5 MPa but the other milling parameters remained unchanged. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> shows LiAlCl 4 /LiCl composites milled at 5 MPa for 0.5 and 1 h with the same BPR and the rotation speeds. LiCl remained present, while some of the LiAlCl 4 was consumed after 30 min, based on the lower intensities of peaks at ˜29°and ˜48°. New peaks, corresponding to the metallic Al, appeared at 38 and 40°. Additional 30 min of milling resulted in disappearance of the LiAlCl 4 peaks. At the same time, peaks corresponding to metallic Al and LiCl by-products showed high intensities. Thus, this mechanically activated reaction involves formation of LiAlCl 4 and amorphous intermediate product, and their subsequent decomposition. Thus, comparing to the decomposition of AlH 3 during the milling, the above experimental evidence indicated that metallic Al formed at lower pressures appeared as a result of the transformation of the LiAlCl 4 intermediate products.</p><p>It appears that TiF 3 has a synergistic effect on the mechanochemical reaction of LiH and AlCl 3 . According to the NMR analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7b</ref>), when TiF 3 was added into the reaction system, almost all of the 6-coordinated Al in AlCl 3 was converted into the 4-coordinated Al in LiAlCl 4 and amorphous Al-H x (x = 1, 2, 3). With furthermore milling, LiAlCl 4 and amorphous Al-H x were first converted to amorphous but then to the 6-coordinated Al in α-AlH 3 . The intermediate LiAlCl 4 and amorphous Al-H x were identified by both XRD and NMR, while, its role in the  mechanochemical process still remains unclear. Ashby et al. [81,82] demonstrated that the transformation between Al IV and Al VI species may occur as a result of Cl replacement by H in LiAlCl 4 , which leads to LiAlCl 4-x H x (x = 1, 2, 3) formation. Thus, it is assumed that a LiAlCl 4- x H x amorphous intermediate formed during the furthermore milling of LiAlCl 4 and Al-H x . It is very likely that LiAlCl 4-x H x amorphous intermediate species are unstable during the ball milling. Compared with more stable α-AlH 3 , this intermediate product cannot maintain its crystalline state during the extended milling times. Therefore, this LiAlCl 4-x H x intermediate eventually transforms into α-AlH 3 . TiF 3 was introduced into the reaction system to shorten transformation time of the amorphous intermediate phases into α-AlH 3 phase. The fine TiF 3 might act as seed crystals and accelerate substitution of the Cl by H in LiAlCl 4-x H x . Moreover, because of the isostructuralism of TiF 3 and α-AlH 3 , TiF 3 prompts α-AlH 3 formation during a short milling time. Thus, an intermediate amorphous LiAlCl 4-x H x phase formed during the milling process. By introducing TiF 3 , this intermediate phase can be crystallized easily. All Al atoms in the final α-AlH 3 phase are six-coordinated with hydrogen atoms. The mechanism of this mechanochemical reaction can be described according to Eq. (10). 3LiH + AlCl 3 → LiAlCl 4 + AlH x + 2LiCl → LiAlCl 4-x H x + 2LiCl → 3LiCl + α-AlH 3 (10)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Dehydrogenation properties of the α-AlH 3 nano-composite</head><p>Considering the influence of Ti-based additives on the desorption properties of hydrogen storage materials, the α-AlH 3 /LiCl nano-composite with TiF 3 might have different dehydriding behavior than pure AlH 3 . Thus, we studied dehydriding properties of TiF 3 -doped α-AlH 3 / LiCl nano-composite under isothermal conditions in the temperature range 80-160 °C. Amount of H 2 released from the composite was obtained by dividing actual H 2 content by the stoichiometric AlH 3 weight. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>, isothermal dehydriding curves exhibit sigmoidal features with distinct introduction, acceleration and decay periods. This behavior is similar to decomposition of other comparable materials. Compared with α-AlH 3 /LiCl nano-composite obtained without TiF 3 (inserting in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>), additive TiF 3 accelerated decomposition kinetics of α-AlH 3 /LiCl nano-composite. Additionally, desorption kinetics improved as the temperature was increased to 160 °C. Thus, temperature can have a large impact on the dehydrogenation reaction kinetics of α-AlH 3 /LiCl composite. The reaction of AlH 3 dehydrogenation can be expressed in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">2AlH 3 → 2Al + 3H 2 ↑ (11)</formula><p>As the reaction temperature increased from 80 to 120 °C, the time of full decomposition decreased rapidly, that a complete decomposition was obtained within 3000 s, suggesting significantly higher decomposition rate at higher temperature (see the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>). In comparison, only 8.0 wt% of H 2 was released at 20-160 °C during α-AlH 3 decomposition reported by Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. After we annealed our as-milled α-AlH 3 at 140 °C, the shape of the dehydriding curve became step-wise for 1160 s with the same hydrogen amount as at 120 °C. Graetz reported that full decomposition time for α-AlH 3 at 138 °C could be achieved within 1800s <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. After we annealed our composite at 160 °C, decomposition curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> was also step-wise for 750 s with higher hydrogen content equal to 9.92 wt%. Shahi found that among all Ti based additives, TiF 3 is found to be the most effective catalyst for dehydrogenation kinetics of nano MgH 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. However, full decomposition for the MgH 2 /TiF 3 at 300 °C could be achieved within 1800s with a maximal hydrogen content of 6.3 wt%. Therefore, TiF 3 not only influenced decomposition temperature of α-AlH 3 but also improved dehydriding kinetics of α-AlH 3 . Although numerous papers showing a dehydriding rate enhancement with the addition of transition metal additives in AlH 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>, the excess transition metal additives have little influence on the dehydriding property of AlH 3 . The α-AlH 3 /LiCl nano-composite with different amounts of TiF 3 (molar ration of LiH/ AlCl 3 /TiF 3 are 3:1:0.1, 3:1:0.2, 3:1:0.3) were heated at 160 °C for different times. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>, desorption kinetics were improved as the molar ratio of TiF 3 increased. However, increment of TiF 3 results in a relatively small increase in the rate. After we annealed our as-milled α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 composite at the same temperature, the full dehydriding time of the curve(III) was reduced from 750 s to 570 s.</p><p>DSC analysis was performed to further understand the dehydriding process <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10a</ref> shows DSC thermograms of as-milled α-AlH 3 composite with TiF 3 at several heating rates(composite synthesized from LiH/AlCl 3 /TiF 3 with a molar ration of 3:1:0.1). The DSC thermograms contain only one endothermic peak within the range of 40-240 °C. The endothermic peak between 80 and 190 °C corresponds to the dehydriding reaction of the α phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. This result indicates that no new phases formed, and α-AlH 3 does not react with TiF 3 during its dehydrogenation. Based on the above non-isothermal analysis, the dehydriding temperature of α-AlH 3 is remarkably reduced with the TiF 3  in the composite. To determinate the apparent activation energy (Ea) of this process, we studied desorption kinetics of the α-AlH 3 /LiCl nanocomposite using the Kissinger's method. Moreover, the relationship between the activation energy (Ea, KJ/mol), the heating rate (c, K/ min), the gas constant (R, 8.314 J/mol K) and the peak temperature of dehydriding (T P , K) in the DSC curve is described by following Kissinger's equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= + ln(c/T ) -(E /RT ) A p 2 a p<label>(12)</label></formula><p>E a for the dehydrogenation reaction calculated from DSC data are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10b</ref>. The E a for the hydrogen desorption of α-AlH 3 in the composite was 52.1 KJ/mol. This value is significantly lower than the value 104 KJ/mol of the α-AlH 3 without TiF 3 reported by Gabis <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. It was reported by Nakagawa that with NbF 5 in α-AlH 3 , the α-AlH 3 /NbF 5 present a quite high hydrogen desorption capacity and fast kinetics. It is worth noting that the activation energy of dehydriding of α-AlH 3 was reduced from 104 to 96 kJ/mol(ΔE is 8 kJ/mol) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Based on above analysis, this decrease in the kinetic barrier contributed to the improvement in the hydrogen desorption kinetics of α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 nano-composite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Microstructural evolution during the dehydriding process</head><p>Morphology of the α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 composite during the dehydriding process was studied with SEM images. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> shows the SEM images of product heated at 160 °C for various times. As observed in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11a</ref>, the particles after desorption for 10 min at 160 °C with a range of 400-500 nm is generally smaller than those of the as-milled α-AlH 3 / LiCl/TiF 3 sample, indicating particle refinement of the product during dehydrogenation of AlH 3 . When the heating time was increased to 20 min, it is observed form Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11b</ref> that the difference in surface morphology is significant due to the aggregation of the composite after further desorption. The morphological characteristics of the product in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11c</ref>, indicate that when heating time was extended to 30 min, the inhomogeneity in particle distributions is significant and most individual particles had an average size between 5-7 μm. This may contribute to the further aggregation of the composite. Based on above SEM observation, it can be seen that the particles in the composite tend to aggregate with the longer heating time. Graetz found that the aggregation of particles will result in the reduction of the gateways for hydrogen diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. This can explain the phenomenon that the dehydriding rates of the α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 composite declined with dehydriding time in the later stage of the isothermal dehydriding process. Thus, particle aggregation may give rise to the decline of the dehydriding kinetics of the α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 nano-composite.</p><p>After the desorption process of the α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 composite, the phase transformation, structural and morphological changes were not clearly understood. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref> shows the TEM of the α-AlH 3 /LiCl/TiF 3 nano-composite heated at 160 °C for 10 min. A large amount of much finer crystallines are observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12a</ref>. The nucleation and quite uniform in size distribution of the crystallites indicates that the dehydrogenation of the α-AlH 3 has occurred simultaneously after heating. This phenomenon has a good agreement with the above dehydriding outcomes. The average size of nano-composite after heating process is approximately to be 50 nm. A selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) of the same material is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12b</ref>. Lattice fringes confirmed that finer crystalline particles matched Al, LiCl and TiF 3 phases (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12b</ref>). Lattice spacings equal to 2.34 and 2.02 Å correspond to (111) and (200) planes of metallic Al. Moreover, the typical lattice spacing which is determined to be 1.55, 1.29 and 3.88, 1.94 Å are attributed to the (311) and (400) planes of the LiCl and (012) and (024) planes of the metal TiF 3 , respectively. These observations indicated that the α-AlH 3 phase decomposed without reacting with TiF 3 , which is in agreement with the DSC results.  </p></div>
