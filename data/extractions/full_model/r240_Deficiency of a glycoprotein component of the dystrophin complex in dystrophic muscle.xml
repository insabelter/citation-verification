<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dystrophin, the protein encoded by the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, exists in a large oligomeric complex. We show here that four glycoproteins are integral components of the dystrophin complex and that the concentration of one of these is greatly reduced in DMD patients. Thus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.</p><p>DuCHENNE muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene located on the X chromosome. Dystrophin, the high-molecular weight protein product of the DMD gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , is localized to the sarcolemmal membrane of normal skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr">2 -5</ref> but is absent from the skeletal muscle of people with DMD 1 • 2 • 6 , xmd dogs 7 and mdx mice 1 • 5 (the last two being possible animal models for DMD). The amino-acid sequence of dystrophin suggests that it is a membrane cytoskeletal protein <ref type="bibr">8 • 9</ref> involved in the anchoring of sarcolemmal proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton. But the exact function of dystrophin and its precise role in the resulting necrosis of dystrophic muscle fibres has not been determined. In studies of other genetic diseases involving proteins of the cytoskeleton <ref type="bibr">10 ' 11</ref> , the absence of one component is sometimes accompanied by the loss of another cytoskeletal protein. Therefore, to understand the molecular pathogenesis of DMD, we sought to identify the proteins associated with or bound to dystrophin and to characterize the status of these proteins in muscle where dystrophin is absent.</p><p>Recently, we have shown that dystrophin can be isolated from detergent-solubilized skeletal muscle membranes using wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose, because of its tight association with a WGA-binding glycoprotein <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> • This indicates that the localization of dystrophin to the cytoplasmic face of the sarcolemma <ref type="bibr">2 -5</ref> results from a tight association of dystrophin with an integral membrane glycoprotein.

NATURE • VOL 345 • 24 MAY 1990   dystrophin using sucrose density-gradient centrifugation in the presence of digitonin. We have identified four glycoproteins of apparent relative molecular masses (Mr) 156,000 (156K), SOK, 43K and 35K as integral components of the dystrophin complex. The 156K and SOK glycoproteins are sarcolemmal glycoproteins, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence. Immunoaffinity beads raised against dystrophin and the SOK glycoprotein selectively adsorb the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Furthermore, there is a marked reduction of the 156K glycoprotein in muscle from mdx mice and DMD patients. These results imply that in dystrophic muscle, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein. This could be the first step in the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex</head><p>This complex was isolated following digitonin-solubilization of rabbit skeletal muscle membranes using WGA-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and further purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.1% digitonin. It is evident from the Coomassie blue-stained gel of sequential gradient fractions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>) that the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was separated from the voltage-sensitive sodium channel and the dihydropyridine receptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The size of the dystrophin complex was ~18S in comparison with {3-galactosidase (15.9S), thyroglobulin (19.2S) and dihydropyridine receptor (20S) standards. Densitometer scanning of the peak dystrophin-containing fractions (10 and 11, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>) revealed several proteins that co-purified with dystrophin: a broad, diffusely staining component with an apparent Mr of 156K, an 88K protein, a triplet of proteins centred at 59K, a SOK protein, a doublet at 43K and proteins of 35K and 25K.</p><p>To identify the glycoprotein constituents of the dystrophinglycoprotein complex, sucrose gradient fractions 7-17 were electrophoretically separated, transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with peroxidase-conjugated WGA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>). Four WGAbinding proteins with apparent Mr of 156K, SOK, 43K and 35K were found to strictly co-purify with dystrophin. All four proteins were also positively stained with peroxidase-conjugated concanavalin A. In addition, the lower Mr component of the 43K protein doublet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) was also positively stained with concanavalin A (not shown).</p><p>The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was further characterized with antibodies raised against various components of the (1 1-Lg ml-1 ); c, polyclonal antisera against the C-terminal decapeptide of dystrophin; d, monoclonal antibody (mAb) XIXC2 against dystrophin; e, mAb IVD3 1 against 50K glycoprotein (50 GP); or e, mAb VIA4 1 against the 156K glycoprotein (156 GP). Arrows indicate the positions of dystrophin (DYS), the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (NaCh), and the a 1 anp a 2 subunits of the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor. Arrowheads denote the positions of the molecular weight standards as indicated. METHODS. Heavy microsomes were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> and washed twice with 0.6 M KCI in 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 0.165 M sucrose, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and 0.75 mM benzamidine to remove contractile proteins. KCI-washed membranes (1 g) were solubilized in 1.0% digitonin, 0.5 M NaCI, and protease inhibitors as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . After removal of the ryanodine receptor by immunoaffinity chromatography <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26</ref> , the digitonin-solubilized membranes were circulated overnight on a 40 ml WGA-Sepharose column, washed extensively, then eluted with three column volumes of 0.3 M N-acetylglucosamine. Eluted fractions containing dystrophin were applied to a 3-ml DEAE-cellulose column and sequentially eluted with the following NaCI concentrations in buffer A</p><p>316 d 224~ 109~ 46~ I 46~ 7 8 II 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 F18Ctlon 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Fract ion -ovs -50GP -15&amp;Gf</p><p>(0.1% digitonin, 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 0.75 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM PMSF): 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 110 and 175 mM. Sucrose gradients (12.5 ml linear 5-20% sucrose) containing 0.5 M NaCI and 0.01% NaN 3 in buffer A were prepared using a Beckman density gradient former. Dystrophin complex, which eluted in fraction 2 (3 ml) from the DEAE-column 175 mM NaCI wash, was concentrated to 0.5 ml in a Centricon-100 (Amicon), layered on a sucrose gradient and overlain with 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 175 mM NaCI and 0.01% NaN 3 . Gradients were centrifuged at 4 oc in a Beckman VTi 65.1 vertical rotor for 90 min at 200,000g. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected from the top of the gradients using an ISCO Model 640 density gradient fractionator. Gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref> (3-12% gradient gel) and stained with Coomassie blue (300 fLI concentrated with a Centricon-100) or transferred to nitocellulose (75 fLI of fractions in b, 25 fLI in c and d, and 50 fLI in e and f) and stained with various antibodies. The blot shown in e was prepared from a gel run in the absence of reducing agent plus 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide. Gel lanes were scanned with a Hoefer GS 300 scanning densitometer and analysed using GS-360 data analysis software. Polyclonal antisera against a chemically synthesized decapeptide representing the C-terminal of dystrophin was raised in New Zealand white rabbits as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28</ref> . Hybridomas were obtained from female BALB/c mice which had been immunized with rabbit skeletal muscle membranes and boosted with WGA eluate <ref type="bibr">29 .</ref> complex. Antisera from a rabbit immunized with a chemically synthesized decapeptide representing the predicted C-terminal amino-acid sequence of human dystrophin, stained a single high-M, protein (Fig. <ref type="figure">lc</ref>). This protein co-migrated with the predominant isoform of dystrophin stained by sheep polyclonal anti-dystrophin antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (not shown). The antisera showed immunofluorescence staining only on the cell periphery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> ), which indicates a restricted localization of dystrophin to the sarcolemma of rabbit skeletal muscle.</p><p>A library of monoclonal antibodies against muscle proteins eluted from WGA-Sepharose was also screened for reactivity against components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and by indirect immunofluorescence staining of rabbit skeletal muscle. Of six hybridomas which showed immunofluorescence staining only on the sarcolemma, monoclonal antibodies XIXC2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 d</ref>) and VIA4 2 (not shown) were found to stain dystrophin on immunoblots. Both dystrophin monoclonal antibodies are IgM subtypes, and recognized both native and denatured dystrophin. Monoclonal antibody XIXC2 also recognizes the minor lower-M, isoform of dystrophin which co-purifies with the more abundant isoform (Fig. <ref type="figure">ld</ref>).</p><p>Two of the other sarcolemma-specific monoclonal antibodies were specific for components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Fig. <ref type="figure">le</ref> and <ref type="figure">lf</ref>). The SOK glycoprotein stained with monoclonal antibody IVD3 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">le</ref>), and has been localized exclusively to the sarcolemmal membrane of rabbit skeletal muscle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>). Monoclonal antibody IVD3 1 recognized only the non-reduced form of the SOK glycoprotein and is not highly cross-reactive. Monoclonal antibody VIA4 1 stained the 156K glycoprotein (Fig. <ref type="figure">lf</ref>) which co-purified with dystrophin. VIA4 1 recognized the denatured form of the 156K glycoprotein and is highly cross-reactive. It also exhibited weak, but specific immunofluorescent staining of the sarcolemmal membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>), consistent with its low affinity for the native 156K glycoprotein. In agreement with the immunofluorescence results, a rabbit membrane preparation greatly enriched in sarcolemmal proteins also showed a substantial enrichment in dystrophin, the 156K and SOK glycoproteins (not shown). Immunofluorescence staining for dystrophin, SOK glycoprotein or the 156K</p><p>NATURE • VOL 345 • 24 MAY 1990 The association of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was also assessed by immunoaffinity adsorption. Immunoaffinity beads were prepared with the monoclonal antibodies XIXC2 (anti-dystrophin) and IVD3 1 (anti-SOK glycoprotein) and incubated with the partially purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. After pelleting the immunoaffinity beads, the supernatants were removed and the beads were washed extensively. The supernatants and washes were pooled (voids), concentrated, and analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The voids from the XIXC2 (anti-dystrophin) and the IVD3 1 (anti-SOK glycoprotein) immunoaffinity beads contained no dystrophin, 59K triplet, SOK, 43K doublet or 35K proteins as detected by Coomassie blue staining (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref> ). Both the XIXC2 (anti-dystrophin) and IVD3 1 (anti-SOK glycoprotein) immunoaffinity beads quantitatively removed dystrophin from the starting material (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref> ). Analysis of the voids for the 156K (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>) and SOK (Fig. <ref type="figure">3e</ref>) glycoproteins revealed that both the XIXC2 and IVD3 1 immunoaffinity beads selectively adsorbed virtually all of each of these glycoproteins from the voids, whereas the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) and the a 1 and a 2 subunits of the dihydropyridine receptor (not shown) remained in the voids. As detected by peroxidase-conjugated WGA (not shown), the 43K and 35K glycoproteins were also adsorbed from the voids. Immunoblots of immunoaffinity beads separated on gels indicated that dystrophin, the 156K and SOK glycoproteins were retained by the beads and not selectively proteolysed (not shown). Initial experiments with monoclonal antibody VIA4 1 (anti-156K glycoprotein) have indicated that it has too low an affinity for the native 156K glycoprotein to be successful in this type of experiment.</p></div>

Staining with polyclonal antisera against the C-terminal decapeptide of dystrophin revealed that dystrophin was completely absent from mdx mouse membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>). In addition, comparison of normal and mdx mouse with immunostaining by monoclonal antibody VIA4 1 against the 156K glycoprotein revealed that the 156K glycoprotein was absent or greatly reduced in mdx mouse membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>). Staining of identical transfers with sheep polyclonal antisera against either the ryanodine receptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>) or the dihydropyridine receptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>) did not differ between control and mdx mouse muscle membranes.

For example, muscle from mdx mice shows elevated intracellular ionized Ca 2 + levels and corresponding higher net degradation of muscle proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> • Loss of a dystrophin-anchored protein with a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium could result in elevated intracellular calcium levels and lead to the reported activation of calciumdependent protease activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> • Such a mechanism could explain the abnormal muscle protein degradation and fibre necrosis of dystrophic muscle.</p><p>The absence of dystrophin-associated proteins in dystrophic muscle may complicate the therapeutic efficacy of myoblast transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> , as the reintroduction of dystrophin synthesis might not lead to recovery of associated protein levels and thus could necessitate treatment at only one particular developmental stage. Finally, a deficiency or defect in a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein could perhaps explain the DMD-like symptoms observed in suspected autosomal-recessive patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> • 24 that express apparently normal dystrophin. 0</p></div>

The protons produce secondary electrons which generate the observed radiation. The photon spectra thus produced are largely model independent and flat. Relativistic neutrons can result from the collisions of highenergy protons with the ambient gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , or high-energy protons with the ambient photon field if their energies are sufficiently large <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> • Actually, in high-energy pp collisions the leading particle carries most of the energi. In about half of these interactions the leading proton is converted into a neutron, so the neutrons can carry away -25-50% of the total luminosity available (here we assume that this fraction is 25%). But unlike protons, the relativistic neutrons are not tied to the ambient magnetic field; they readily escape from the system and traverse on the average a distance r = 3 x 10 13 'Yn em before they decay, 'Yn being the neutron Lorentz factor. Therefore, if the neutron distribution</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIG. 1 Sedimentation of dystrophin complex through 5% to 20% linear sucrose gradients. a, Coomassie blue-stained gel of sucrose gradient fractions 7-17. b-f.

Membranes from control and mdx mice (gifts of Dr Richard Strohmen and Dr Richard Entrikin of University of California, Berkeley and Davis, respectively) were prepared in 10% sucrose, 76.8 nM aprotinin, 0.83 mM benzamidine, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 1.1 iJ.M leupeptin, 0.7 f.LM pepstatin A, 0.23 mM PMSF, 20 mM Tris-maleate, pH 7.0, by centrifuging muscle homogenates for 15 min at 14,000g and subsequently pelleting the supernatant for 30 min at 125,000g, followed by KCI washing as described in Fig.1. Control and mdx mouse muscle membranes were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described in Fig.1. The amount of 156K glycoprotein in each preparation was estimated densitometrically from autoradiographs of identical blots incubated with 125 1-labelled sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody3 2 .    </figDesc></figure>
