<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Immunotherapeutic interventions have long been utilized in urologic oncology for the treatment of metastatic renal cell or superficial transitional cell carcinoma. Most recently, the first active specific immunotherapeutic approach, a cancer vaccine, has passed the final phase of human testing and its approval by the FDA is pending. However, evidence suggests that the full protective and therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines has not yet been achieved. Through multiple mechanisms, tumors promote conditions in the tumor-bearing host that mitigate or even eliminate the vaccine-induced antitumor response. Restoration of the impaired immune function is, therefore, imperative for achieving optimum vaccine efficacy. Targeted pharmacological interventions are capable of overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, and thereby enable cancer vaccination to reach its full therapeutic potential.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past decade, a variety of immuno therapeutic approaches have been tested to stimulate the cell ular and humoral arms of the immune system and to induce regression of malignant disease. Several investi gational strategies are under consideration, including the applica tion of cytokines and of adjuvant agents that modulate the cytokine response; therapeutic cancer vaccines designed to elicit cellular immune responses against tumorassociated antigens (TAAs); and mono clonal antibody drugs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> At present, only a few immuno therapeutic approaches have received approval by the FDA for treatment of urological malignancies, most notably the systemic administration of interleukin (IL) 2 against metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guérin or interferon α for superficial bladder cancer. Active spe cific immunotherapeutic approaches, in the form of cancer vaccines, have just begun to show therapeutic success in genitourinary and other malignancies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and are, therefore, considered an attractive avenue for oncol ogy research and drug development. In this Review, we first provide a concise update on the results of cancer vaccine trials in the field of urological oncology. We then highlight the problems presented by the phenomenon of tumormediated immunosuppression. Finally, we discuss novel translational interventions to counteract immuno suppressive pathways in the tumor microenvironment in order to enhance the immunological and clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cancer vaccines</head><p>Cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate expansion of the cellular arm of the immune system, especially T cells and natural killer cells. Cytotoxic and helper T lympho cytes are the main immune effector cells, which kill tumor cells with pinpoint accuracy via receptormediated inter actions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Both cell types require activation by antigenpresenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), to recognize and kill tumor cells in context with MHC self antigens. Natural killer cells, by contrast, kill rather non specifically and represent the first line of immunological defense against cancer and foreign pathogens (Box 1). Many vaccine approaches have shown high efficacy at triggering Tcell responses against TAAs in tumor bearing animals-these approaches include vaccina tion with genemodified tumor cells, antigenloaded DCs, recombinant viral expression cassettes, and heat shock proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> All these approaches have now moved from the preclinical research arena into clinical trials, the results of which have been previously reviewed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Although contemporary vaccine strategies are relatively effective at enhancing cellular immune responses against tumors in animals and humans, clinical responses and tumor regression have been observed in only a few clini cal trials. Overall, rates of tumor regression have seldom exceeded 5-10%, and the discouragingly short duration of these responses (no more than a few months) has raised serious questions regarding the efficacy of this treatment approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Many explanations have been offered for the limited capacity of cancer vaccines to induce tumor regres sion. First, therapeutic cancer vaccines must be initially studied in patients with advanced or metastatic disease, who typically exhibit a profoundly suppressed immune response. Second, the immunogenicity of the TAAs used in reported vaccine formulations is low, as most TAAs represent selfantigens that are overexpressed or reactivated in cancer cells relative to the non cancerous cells from which they originated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> Finally, tumors can evade the immune system (including the immune responses triggered by vaccination) through the induc tion of immune tolerance or immune suppression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> as discussed in the later sections of this manuscript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recent results</head><p>Two clinical trials in patients with metastatic prostate cancer-one of genemodified prostate tumor cells and the other of prostate acid phosphatase (PAP) antigen loaded DCs-have recently received major attention. At the 2009 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancer Symposium, Small and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> reported the results of vITAL2, a multi center, randomized, phase III clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GvAX ® <ref type="bibr">(Cell Genesys</ref> Inc., South San Francisco, CA, uSA) immunotherapy in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy versus docetaxel chemotherapy and prednisone in patients with hormonerefractory prostate cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> GvAX ® is a vaccine that consists of a mixture of allogeneic prostate tumor cells genetically engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF). This trial included only patients with taxane naive, castrationresistant prostate cancer who had pain that required opioid analgesia; the primary end point was superiority in overall survival. The study was pre maturely halted owing to an observed imbalance in death rates between the two treatment arms.</p><p>Overall, vITAL2 enrolled 408 patients, 114 of whom died during the course of the trial: 67 in the GvAX ®</p><p>plus docetaxel combination treatment arm and 47 in the docetaxel-prednisone control arm. Analysis revealed no significant difference in the patients' base line character istics or toxic effects of treatment that could explain the imbalance in death rate. A survival advantage (14.1 months versus 12.2 months; hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.15-2.53) was seen in the control arm (docetaxel-prednisone) over the experimental arm. These results were surprising as earlierphase studies had established a very favorable adverseeffect profile of the vaccine; adverse events mainly consisted of mild injectionsite reactions and flulike symptoms. While the cause of the poorer survival with the vaccine therapy is currently being investigated, this study highlights that caution must be exercised when con ducting combinatorial drug trials, especially when the toxic effects and effector mechanisms of combined drug action have not been fully elucidated. Although several experimental studies have alluded to potential synergy between chemotherapy and vaccines, ques tions related to the mechanisms of action, the timing of administra tion, and the appropriate choice of agents are still unanswered. 11 On a morepositive note, at the 2009 American urological Association annual meeting, Schellhammer</p><p>Key points Cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate an antitumor immune response ■ via expansion of the cellular arm of the immune system, especially T cells or natural killer cells At present, the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines in patients with advanced ■ genitourinary cancers is limited In patients with cancer, tumors promote immunosuppression via multiple ■ mechanisms including secretion of tumor-derived factors, mobilization of bonemarrow-derived suppressor myeloid cells and induction of T-regulatory cells An immunosuppressive microenvironment helps cancer cells to evade immune ■ recognition and immune-mediated destruction Simultaneous targeting of tumor-induced immune suppression and ■ administration of a cancer vaccine has great potential to boost the antitumor immune response and produce a more-powerful therapeutic effect than vaccination alone Clinical trials that are investigating combinatorial approaches that entail ■ abrogation of tumor-induced immunosuppression followed by active immunotherapy are ongoing in many academic and industry programs et al. 2 reported that sipuleucelT (Provenge ® ; Dendreon Corporation, Seattle, WA, uSA)-a vaccine consisting of autologous antigenpresenting cells activated in vitro by use of a recombinant fusion protein (PAP-GM CSF)-increased the median survival of men with metastatic prostate cancer compared with a placebo control, without significant toxic effects. 2 In contrast to the prematurely terminated vITAL2 trial, this random ized, placebocontrolled, phase III study (named IMPACT) enrolled only patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic hormonerefractory prostate cancer (n = 512). The primary end point of this study was overall survival. The patients' demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in the experimental and control treatment arms. Patients who received sipu leucelT had a 4.1month improvement in their median survival (25.8 months versus 21.7 months) and a greater than threefold increase in survival at 36 months com pared with those who received placebo. Interestingly, no significant delay was found in the time to objective disease progression and PSA response. These data are currently being reviewed by the FDA and their deci sion on this drug's approval is pending. No doubt the appropriate selection of patients, improvement in man ufacturing processes, the choice of adjuvant strate gies, and the development of bio markers to measure treat ment success will all be critical to upcoming trials with this and other vaccine approaches. As these trials were phase III registration trials with survival as the end point, immune response analysis was not reported. However, earlier phase I-II trials demonstrated that sipuleucelT can induce PAPspecific Tcell responses, while GvAX ® induced an eosinophilic infiltrate at the injection site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tumor-mediated immunosuppression</head><p>Cancer vaccines are designed to activate and mobilize the host's adaptive immune response against tumors in ReVIewS a targeted, antigenspecific fashion. Despite consider able progress in the identification of TAAs and in the develop ment of effective vaccination strategies, the clini cal results of therapeutic cancer vaccination have been disappointing thus far. One of the reasons for the lack of success is that virtually all antitumor vaccines were ini tially studied in patients with bulky or metastatic disease. However, patients with advanced malignancy have a com promised immune system and exhibit alterations in the proliferative and cytotoxic capacities of their T cells and natural killer cells, and in host cytokine expression and production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Ample evidence indicates that distinct compartments of the tumor microenvironment directly modulate the immune system via secretion of immuno suppressive factors such as TNF, TGFβ1, vascular endothelial growth factor (veGF), GCSF, and GMCSF (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). These gene products mediate the conversion of tumor infiltrating and peripheral myeloid cells-bone marrowderived precursor cells that give rise to various hematopoietic cells such as leukocytes, monocytes, and DCs-into immunosuppressive, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumorassoci ated macro phages, or Thelper2biased, tolerogenic DCs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> MDSCs express the transmembrane glyco protein CD11b and are key mediators of immuno suppression in the tumorbearing host and of tumor growth via the stimulation of angiogenesis and tumor progres sion. MDSCs can be divided into two major cate gories, namely CD33 + CD11b + myelomonocytic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and CD15 + CD11b + CD14 -granulocytetype cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Both these cell types are profoundly immunosuppressive and represent independent lineages that arise from myeloid precursor cells. A typical hallmark of MDSCs is the overexpression of arginase 1, a key enzyme in the inhibi tion of Tcell responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Moreover, oxidative stress and secretion of nitric oxide (NO) by MDSCs contribute to the hostile, immunosuppressive tumor micro environment by attenuating Tcell function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> MDSCs are frequently detected in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic RCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> or bladder carcinoma (e. eruslanov, personal communication). Moreover, MDSC frequencies seem to correlate with the stage of the disease, and potentially provide an important biomarker of prognosis.</p><p>Studies have shown that MDSCs can trigger expan sion of another important immunosuppressive cell ular subset, termed Tregulatory cells (T ReG ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> T ReG represent an important, highly specialized subpopula tion of CD4 + Thelper cells that suppress activation of other T cells, especially of those specific against self antigens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Interest in T ReG biology has been heightened by recent studies that demonstrate enhanced cancer vaccinemediated immunity after T ReG elimination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> In humans, T ReG are character ized by expression of the highaffinity CD25 αchain of the IL2 receptor (IL2R) and the trans cription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). As with MDSCs, signifi cantly elevated T ReG levels are found in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer, and increased T ReG frequencies are associated with reduced overall survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> As MDSCs and T ReG are major contributors to cancer mediated immunosuppression, considerable interest exists in further investigating these cellular subsets and in developing pharmacological interventions to reduce their immunosuppressive properties and, thereby, stim ulate immune responses against cancer. In the follow ing sections, we will delineate the molecular pathways associated with MDSCmediated and T ReG mediated immunosuppression and provide novel insights into translational strategies that might counteract immuno suppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment in urological cancer (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Targeting of MDSCs</head><p>The importance of immunosuppressive pathways in tumors is well accepted by basic science and clinical investigators. As a result, the concept of favorably altering the tumor microenvironment to enable immune effector cells to interact with their tumor targets has become an exciting new direction in translational immunological research. Owing to the highly complex organization of the tumor microenvironment, a variety of approaches that target specific pathways are presently being consid ered in order to achieve favorable tumor tissue condi tioning for therapy and to reverse the negative effect of tumors on immune function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The receptor tyrosine kinase pathway</head><p>Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent a rapidly growing family of drugs with demonstrated clinical activity against malignancy, especially RCC. These agents target critical growth pathways that modulate tumor progres sion and metastatic potential. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Moreover, some of these agents induce immunostimulatory effects by down regulating the secretion of immuno suppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> For example, the multi kinase inhibitor sunitinib shows both anti tumor and immunomodulatory activity after oral administration.</p><p>In patients with metastatic RCC, sunitinib significantly reduced MDSC and T ReG numbers in the peripheral blood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Moreover, improved Tcell responses and abroga tion of MDSCmediated immuno suppression were achieved via reduction of levels of immuno suppressive cytokines and transcription factors and enhancement of interferon γ secretion by T cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Importantly, tumors of sunitinibtreated mice exhibited remarkable infiltra tion of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and CD4 + Thelper cells, which suggested druginduced activa tion and successful homing of T cells into tumors. The antitumor and immuneenhancing effects of sunitinib might be mediated via a common mechanism, namely inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> STAT3 is not only con stitutively activated in various cancer cells, but also in MDSCs, which thereby inhibits differentiation of DCs and promotes tumor immune evasion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Cumulatively, these data suggest that sunitinib, and maybe other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can be used effectively to reverse tumorinduced immuno suppression. Thus, the clinical evaluation of combina torial regimens that study potential synergism between sunitinib and immunological approaches is ongoing in many academic and industry settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PgE 2 metabolism</head><p>Prostaglandin e 2 (PGe 2 ) is a key molecule that prevents the generation of antitumor immune responses by inhib iting maturation and function of DCs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> Moreover, intratumoral PGe 2 promotes tumor growth by activat ing signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> Intratumoral PGe 2 levels are physiologically regulated through NAD + linked 15hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15PGDH), an enzyme that facilitates degradation of PGe 2 . expression and catabolic activity of 15PGDH is frequently decreased in cancer tissues, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> which causes profound immuno suppression via increased intra tumoral levels of PGe 2 . Loss of 15PGDH expression correlates with tumor progression in colorectal, lung, and transitional cell bladder cancers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> We have shown that targeted overexpression of HPGD (the gene encod ing 15PGDH) at the tumor site can significantly reduce PGe 2 levels in the tumor microenvironment and promote a therapeutic antitumor response in animals that carry prostate or colon carcinomas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Thus, forced expression or pharmacological stimulation of 15PGDH in the tumor microenvironment with recombinant expression vectors or other gene delivery systems might represent an effective approach to reduce immunosuppressive intratumoral PGe 2 levels and to promote stimulation of effective antitumor immune responses, both innate and vaccineinduced.</p><p>A second major approach by which intratumoral PGe 2 synthesis can be modulated is via inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> COX enzymes convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, including PGe 2 , and thromboxane. Recent clinical research suggests that aspirin and other NSAIDs, which are wellcharacterized inhibitors of COX2, can reduce the incidence of certain human malignancies, including colorectal and prostate cancers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> Selective COX2 inhibition facilitates cyto toxic CD8 + Tlymphocyte infiltration of tumors, elevates systemic IL12 and interferon γ levels, and reduces levels of IL10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and MDSCs in a tumorbearing mouse host. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> In addition, adjunctive COX2 inhibitors increase the potency of cancer vaccines and prolong sur vival in experimental animals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> Moreover, the clinically available compound NOaspirin (nitricoxidereleasing aspirin) interferes with the Tcell inhibitory activity of </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arginine metabolism</head><p>Increased metabolic activity of larginine in MDSCs and tumorassociated macrophages triggers impairment of Tlymphocyte responses to tumor antigens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> essential components of this Tlymphocyte suppression pathway include two enzymes that compete for larginine as a substrate: arginase and NO synthase. Arginase is, there fore, implicated in the regulation of synthesis of both NO and polyamines, both of which are detri mental to Tcell function. Cancers exhibit an altered arginine metab olism because expression of arginase is upregulated in the tumor microenvironment. Increased arginase activity reduces access to free arginine and blocks the prolifera tion of Teffector cells as a result of arginine starvation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> Both arginase type 1 and 2 have been implicated in tumorinduced immune dysfunction in metastatic RCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and prostate cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Importantly, expression of argi nase in myeloid cells is inducible and can be regulated by type II cytokines, such as IL4 and IL13, and by PGe 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of arginase activity significantly delays tumor growth in mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> These results indicate that arginase modulates the larginine metabolic pathway to regulate both Tcell function and tumor cell growth. Blockade of arginase type 1 or 2 in a clinical setting might aid in the restoration of immune function by increasing larginine availability for Tcell use and might lead to a decrease in tumor cell growth. Targeting the relationship between arginase and the immune system might offer therapeutic approaches for patients with advanced malignancies.</p></div>

Tumor cells, for example renal cell carcinoma, secrete a variety of bioactive products that stimulate mobilization of immature myeloid cells from bone marrow into the peripheral blood. These cells are profoundly immunosuppressive and support tumor growth via inhibition of adaptive immune responses. By contrast, the proportion of T H 1-biased dendritic cells and their immediate precursors are reduced in patients with cancer. Both the secreted products and myeloid cells are candidates for targeted therapies to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccines (red text). Finally, many tumor-recruited myeloid cells migrate into tumor tissues where they support tumor growth via local immunosuppression and stimulation of neoangiogenesis (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Targeting of T REG</head><p>The ability of tumors to evade destruction by immune effector cells is an important characteristic that enables their uncontrolled growth and survival.

Nevertheless, clinical trials that seek to deplete T ReG with lowdose cyclo phosphamide followed by active immunotherapy are currently ongoing in several institutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and future perspectives</head><p>Novel insights into tumor immunology and biology have accelerated efforts to bring new cancer thera pies into clinical practice. Immunebased therapies, such as cancer vaccines, have demonstrated efficacy at inducing immuno logical antitumor responses in patients with cancer. However, vaccineinduced clini cal responses are sporadic and generally of only short duration. As a possible explana tion, tumormediated immune suppres sion represents a major obstacle to the stimulation of Tcell responses for clinical effect. Thus, novel strategies to abrogate tumormediated immuno suppression and restore immuno competence in these patients are mandatory. Studies show that by counter acting local or peripheral immuno suppression, the potential for a therapeutic response to cancer vaccines is markedly enhanced. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that mediate immune evasion is, therefore, neces sary to define and develop new molecular targets for therapy. Targeting these molecules might augment vaccine induced immune responses and improve clinical outcomes in patients with cancer.</p><p>Cancer is a complex disease, and successful vaccine therapy will require a multimodal or combinatorial treatment approach. Critical elements of such a con certed therapeutic strategy include not only improved vaccine formulations, but also strategies to reverse immunosuppressive pathways in the tumor micro environment. Future clinical trials will provide better insight into the optimum combination of agents to reverse tumor mediated immunosuppression and induce Tcell responses with clinical impact.</p></div>
