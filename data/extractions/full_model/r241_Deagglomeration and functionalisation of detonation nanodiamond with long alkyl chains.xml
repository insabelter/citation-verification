<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Diamond nanoparticles have found considerable interest recently due to their potential applications in biological systems, composites and electronic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Their apparent biocompatibility [2] and chemical inertness make them an ideal candidate for all kinds of biomedical devices. On the other hand, their surface can be functionalised with a variety of groups in order to incorporate them into polymer matrices, surface coatings and the like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. An essential prerequisite for these applications is the control of surface structure and particle size and agglomeration.</p><p>So far, different approaches for the surface functionalisation and deagglomeration have been taken. Chiganova produced diamond hydrosols from oxidized detonation diamond [4], whereas Xu and coworkers used surface active compounds for the dispersion of nanodiamond particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>. Khabashesku et al. obtained small agglomerates of ∼160 nm in size by the fluorination of detonation diamond <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>. These particles formed stable suspensions in THF. Another approach is the mechanical deagglomeration in suspension by stirred media milling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> or beads assisted sonic disintegration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Covalent surface modification of nanodiamond has been reported by several authors. Reactions with fluorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>, chlorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, ammonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref> and hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11]</ref> lead to homogenized, surface modified nanodiamond materials with increased reactivity and the option for further functionalisation. Oxidation of the surface can be achieved by air oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> or treatment with oxidizing mineral acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. We have recently reported on a wetchemical method for the hydroxylation of the nanodiamond surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>. This allowed for the subsequent grafting of different trialkoxysilanes and the further functionalisation by covalent bonding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>. On the other hand, Nakamura and coworkers as well as Tsubota and coworkers have reported on the covalent grafting of alkyl and aryl moieties by radical reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>.</p><p>Here we report on the grafting of alkyl chains by an esterification reaction on hydroxylated detonation diamond. This simple and efficient method yields "nanodiamond esters" with alkyl chains with different lengths. The latter should have an impact on the dispersibility of the functionalised nanodiamond in organic solvents.</p></div>

The resulting hydrophilic material with an agglomerate size of several hundred nanometers up to several microns was reacted with carboxylic acid chlorides in a toluene suspension (Scheme 1). It has to be mentioned that the synthesis of acid chlorides with oxalyl chloride ((COCl) 2 ) rather than thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ) is to be favored. The removal of excess reagent and complete removal of side products proved more difficult in the latter case.</p><p>Better dispersion during the reaction was achieved by sonication. The acid chlorides readily reacted with the surface hydroxyl groups. No change to the diamond structure was inflicted as proven by powder XRD measurements (not shown). The IR spectra show a significant increase in the C-H signal for the alkylated samples, and its intensity corresponds to the chain length of the alkyl group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). Additionally, the existence of an ester bond is indicated by the C_O signal at 1720 cm -1 , which was not present in the hydroxylated nanodiamond.</p><p>Thermogravimetric measurements were carried out in order to further support the covalent nature of the grafting and to determine the surface loading. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the thermograms of pristine and the three higher alkyl ester diamond materials.</p><p>The removal of the surface functional groups begins only beyond 300 °C (independently of the boiling point of the potentially adsorbed carboxylic acids), indicating a covalent bonding via the same structural moiety, i.e. an ester bond, for all alkylated species. The graph for pristine material shows the desorption of adsorbed water (up to 120 °C) and a weight increase above 450 °C. The latter is due to the reaction with the surrounding atmosphere (nitrogen) and is typical for this type of nanodiamond. The further weight loss is due to sublimation of carbon clusters as proven by mass spectrometric investigation of the exhaust gas. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the elemental composition, thermogravimetric data and the resulting surface loading with alkyl ester groups.</p><p>For all diamond alkyl esters the surface loading was found to be in the range of 0.3-0.4 mmol g -1 . Compared to silanization of the hydroxylated diamond (up to 1.5 mmol g -1 ) this surface coverage is comparatively low. One of the reasons for this difference might be that only the most reactive hydroxyl groups, i.e. neopentyl or tert-butyl alcohols, do react with the acid chlorides. Additionally, the long alkyl chains are able to wrap around the diamond surface, hindering the reaction of further existing surface groups. This is supported by the fact that the highest loading is obtained for the shortest chain. Another indication for the preferred reaction of neopentyl or tert-butyl hydroxyl groups is the fact, that the resulting diamond esters are not stable in water, methanol and to a lesser extent ethanol. Most likely, steric reasons are responsible for the preferred hydrolysis of these branched ester moieties as steric strain is reduced upon cleavage of the ester bond. It is highly likely, that the diamond surface bears a large number of neopentyl and tert-butyl hydroxyl groups as the diamond lattice is directly connected with the surface.</p><p>The stability of these diamond esters in non-protic organic solvents is not affected by this structural peculiarity, though. No cleavage was observed even after prolonged sonication in large amounts of the respective organic solvents. Instead, we observed that the grafting of long alkyl chains considerably increases the dispersion stability of these functionalised diamond materials and reduced the size of the existing agglomerates. Pentane, toluene, tetrahydrofurane (THF) and dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ) were tested for dispersibility of the different diamond materials. Pristine and hydroxylated nanodiamond did not form   stable suspensions in any of the tested solvents, only slightly slower sedimentation in THF was observed. This could be the result of hydrogen bonding between surface hydroxyl groups and the ether moiety of THF. The diamond esters formed stable suspension in THF and even more in dichloromethane. In the latter solvent no sedimentation was observed for a period of one month. The particle size of the agglomerates in the suspensions was reduced from several micron (pristine ND: ∼ 15 μm, ND-OH: ∼ 6 μm) to 300-450 nm in the case of ND-OOC-C 3 H 7 (2), 150-260 nm for ND-OOC-C 5 H 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref>, ∼170 nm for ND-OOC-C 12 H 23 (4), and 170-300 nm for ND-OOC-C 18 H 37 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the development of suspensions of pristine detonation diamond and compounds 1-5 in dichloromethane.</p><p>The stable dispersion of functionalised nanodiamond in organic solvents opens the way to further surface modification in more homogeneous systems leading to better accessibility of the surface groups as well as a more homogeneous distribution of the diamond particles in the medium. Carboxylic groups with terminal surface groups have to be reacted with the diamond surface if further reactions are to be carried out. This work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>In summary we have modified the surface of hydroxylated detonation nanodiamond with alkyl chains of different length by an esterification reaction of carboxylic acid chlorides with the surface hydroxyl groups. The resulting materials had a surface loading of 0.3-0.4 mmol g -1 and showed a much better dispersibility in several organic solvents along with a smaller particle size of the remaining agglomerates. This enables the homogeneous incorporation of such materials in non-hydrophilic matrices and further modification in stable suspension. In the future, it will be important to further reduce the agglomerate size by such chemical deagglomeration and stabilization techniques down to the primary particles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
