<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Tubulointerstitial fibrosis represents the key underlying pathology of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), yet treatment options remain limited. In this study, we investigated the role of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannelmediated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in purinergic-mediated disassembly of adherens and tight junction complexes in early tubular injury. Methods: Human primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTECs) and clonal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were treated with Transforming Growth Factor Beta1 (TGF-β1) ± apyrase, or ATPγS for 48 h. For inhibitor studies, cells were co-incubated with Cx43 mimetic Peptide 5, or purinergic receptor antagonists Suramin, A438079 or A804598. Immunoblotting, single-cell force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assessed protein expression, cell-cell adhesion and paracellular permeability. Carboxyfluorescein uptake and biosensing measured hemichannel activity and real-time ATP release, whilst a heterozygous Cx43 +/-mouse model with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) assessed the role of Cx43 in vivo.</p><p>Results: Immunohistochemistry of biopsy material from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed increased expression of purinergic receptor P2X7. TGF-β1 increased Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity and ATP release in hPTECs and HK2 cells. The cytokine reduced maximum unbinding forces and reduced cell-cell adhesion, which translated to increased paracellular permeability. Changes were reversed when cells were co-incubated with either Peptide 5 or P2-purinoceptor inhibitors. Cx43 +/-mice did not exhibit protein changes associated with early tubular injury in a UUO model of fibrosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Data suggest that Cx43 mediated ATP release represents an initial trigger in early tubular injury via its actions on the adherens and tight junction complex. Since Cx43 is highly expressed in nephropathy, it represents a novel target for intervention of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CKD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Affecting 10% of the global population and increasing in prevalence annually, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a health crisis from which millions die in the absence of a definitive treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Individuals are more in danger of CKD if they have any one or more of a number of risk factors including high blood pressure, smoking, established cardiovascular disease and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Characterized by persistent inflammation and fibrosis, tubulointerstitial injury of the proximal region is the key underlying pathology of CKD and develops in response to a number of morphological and phenotypic changes culminating in loss of epithelial stability and increased extracellular matrix deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Despite our understanding of these changes, knowledge of the stimuli that initiate activation of resident primary tubular epithelial cells remains limited.</p><p>In recent years, trans-membrane proteins called connexins have attracted considerable interest as a potential future target for treatment of multiple disease states <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, including various forms of CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Connexins assemble into hexameric structures called hemichannels, forming pores in the membrane which directly link the cytoplasm of adjacent cells through the formation of gap junctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In the absence of cell-cell adhesion, gap junctions fail to form and uncoupled hemichannels allow paracrine release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the local extracellular environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In CKD, diabetic nephropathy accounts for approximately 50% of patients presenting with end-stage renal failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Hyperglycemia and downstream changes in connexin expression are critical in the development and progression of secondary micro-vascular complications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with glucose decreasing gap junction conductance and disrupting cellular homeostasis in a variety of cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Evidence that connexin expression is linked to renal damage in CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, suggests that they represent a viable therapeutic target for treatment of the disease. Recent studies have confirmed elevated levels of predominant isoform Cx43, in human and rodent models of early renal disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> whilst the Cx43 +/-unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse demonstrates reduced collagen deposition and macrophage infiltration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Work within our group confirmed increased expression of Cx43 in the tubular region of biopsy material isolated from patients with diabetic nephropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Despite increased expression, Transforming Growth Factor Beta, the main pro-fibrotic cytokine linked to tubular injury in both diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, reduced gap junction mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and increased hemichannel mediated ATP release <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. With elevated levels of nucleotides and altered connexin expression linked to inflammation and fibrosis in multiple tissue types <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, it seems plausible that the loss of GJIC and the subsequent switch to Cx43 mediated hemichannel ATP release in the proximal tubule may be instrumental in facilitating tubular injury.</p><p>Loss of E-cadherin (ECAD) mediated cell-cell adhesion is pivotal in initiating a series of phenotypic and morphological events that precede tubulointerstitial fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, with the disassembly of the adherens junction (AJ) and tight junction (TJ) complexes linked to loss of epithelial stability, inflammation, fibrosis and impaired renal function <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. In the present study, we combine in vivo and in vitro models of CKD to investigate if targeting Cx43 expression and hemichannel activity through genetic and pharmacological blockade, could negate loss of markers linked with tubular injury, ultimately improving function through diminished hemichannel activity, restoration of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion and reduced paracellular permeability. Using an array of techniques to assess both changes in expression (immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting) and changes in function (e.g. ATP biosensing, single-cell force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial resistance) we demonstrate that increased Cx43 expression and hemichannel mediated ATP release promotes disassembly of adherens and tight junction complexes in human primary proximal tubule epithelial cells and in the UUO mouse model of advanced fibrosis in which the initiating cause is tubulointerstitial inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Blockade of hemichannel mediated ATP release by the Cx43 mimetic Peptide 5, reduces disassembly of the adherens/ tight junction complex and restores epithelial integrity. Importantly, these observations were paralleled in the Cx43 +/-UUO model, where Cx43 expression is reduced by 50%. Up-regulated in renal tubules of people with diabetic nephropathy (DN) and linked to multiple models of disease and fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, P2X7 appears instrumental in mediating these ATP driven effects. Together, our study indicates that aberrant Cx43-mediated ATP release may represent a future therapeutic target in preventing early tubular injury linked to tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) in CKD.</p></div>

Unilateral ureteral obstruction surgery was performed as describe previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Non-obstructed kidneys were used as controls. Mice were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice, as defined by the relevant national animal welfare bodies of France, and all work was approved by the appropriate committee of the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) and the Sorbonne Université (Paris, France). Animals were housed at constant temperature with ad libitum access to water and food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biopsy staining</head><p>Kidney biopsy slices were obtained from patients with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy (DN) (mean age 55; mean diabetes duration: 6.2 yrs.; mean HbA1c: 7.2%; mean serum creatinine: 464 μmol/L; mean proteinuria: 5.80 g/24 h, n = 10). Control renal tissue was obtained from 5 nephrectomy specimens treated for renal carcinoma (mean age 61; mean serum creatinine: 87.8 μmol/L, n = 6). As described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, paraffin-embedded renal sections (4 μm) were de-paraffinized, rehydrated and subjected to microwave-based antigen retrieval in citric buffer solution (10 mM), followed by quenching in 1% H 2 O 2 and blocking in 2% BSA solution. Sections were stained overnight with anti-P2Y2 (Santa-Cruz, 1: 50), anti-P2Y6 (Novus Biologicals, 1:250) or anti-P2X7 (Novus Biologicals, 1:200) antibodies and subsequently incubated with DAKO EnVision + System-HRP antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Rabbit IgG was incubated with both DN and control renal sections for isotype-matched negative controls. DAB substrate was used for visualisation and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Tip-less Arrow TL1 cantilevers (Nanoworld AG, Switzerland) with a low spring constant were used (0.03 N/m). Cantilevers were sterilized with UV (10mins), before being functionalised in poly-L-lysine (25 μg/ml, 30mins, RT), and fibronectin (20 μg/ml, 2 h, 37 °C). A single cell was captured at the end of the cantilever with a set force (0.8-1 nN) and contact time (8-10s). After attachment, the cell was left to recover for &gt; 5 min, allowing surface binding. The cantilever-attached cell was brought into contact with a substrate cell, until a 1nN contact force was reached. The two cells were attached for 10s to allow cell-cell adhesion, after which the cantilever was retracted at a constant speed (5 μm/sec).</p><p>Force-displacement curves were measured until complete detachment (pulling length of 40-90 μm).

To delineate the functional consequences of these altered levels of expression, atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assessed changes in cell-cell tethering and paracellular permeability respectively. Corroborating recent findings that depletion of Claudin-2 and ZO-1 is detrimental to proximal tubule epithelial cell function through a "leaky" epithelia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> both TGF-β1 and ATPγS independently reduce PTEC resistance, and ultimately impair barrier integrity. Furthermore, force spectroscopy confirmed ATPγS reduced the unbinding force required to uncouple two attached cells. Co-incubation of TGF-β1 with the ectonucleotidase apyrase, partially restored expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin, yet failed to negate TGF-β1 evoked changes in tight junction protein expression. These observations, can most likely be explained by studies confirming a role for ATP metabolites in regulating expression of tight junction proteins, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> and are further supported by observations that TGF-β1 evoked changes in tight junction expression are blunted when cells are co-incubated with adenosine receptor antagonist; Suramin. The origin of this deleterious signal was confirmed in TGF-β1 treated cells preincubated with Peptide 5. Peptide 5 is a 12 amino acid peptide which targets the 2nd extracellular loop of Cx43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, it has been proven successful in blocking Cx43 hemichannels when delivered topically, intraocularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, into cerbebrospinal fluid and systemically <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Multiple approaches have been used to confirm target applicability and specificity and all have yielded similar and significant benefits across different injury models. The ability of Peptide 5 to block hemichannel activity, ATP-release and ultimately disassembly of the adherens/tight junction complex in our model system, was assessed by carboxyfluorescein dye uptake, ATP-biosensing and Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> Cx43 +/-mice exhibit minimal disassembly of the adherens and tight junction complex. Quantification of immunohistochemical staining determined an increase in N-cadherin (a &amp; c) and decrease in ZO-1 (b &amp; d) expression in wildtype (WT) UUO compared to WT sham controls. In Cx43 +/-(UUO) mice, expression of both markers was partially restored to near basal levels. Furthermore, western blotting (e) of renal cortex determined changes in expression of E-cadherin (f), β-catenin (g) and Claudin-2 (h) in WT UUO mice compared to WT shams, congruent to those found in vitro when cells were treated with TGF-β1. As expected, these changes were partially negated in Cx43 +/-(UUO) mice. Results were from six separate experiments; with significance shown: *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001 western blotting respectively. Co-incubation of both HK2 and hPTECS with TGF-β1 and Peptide 5 significantly reduced dye uptake and restored ATP release to near basal, whilst Peptide 5 successfully prevented TGF-β1-evoked changes in expression of E-cadherin, Ncadherin, Claudin-2 and ZO-1 in human primary renal proximal tubule cells.</p><p>Confirmation for Cx43 mediated ATP release in initiating these changes of early tubular injury, was confirmed in a Cx43 +/-heterogeneous knockout mouse model having undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The UUO model recapitulates the fundamental pathogenic mechanisms that typify all forms of CKD including diabetic nephropathy and is widely used for the study of renal fibrosis and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Staining renal cortex slices from wildtype UUO mice confirmed a decrease in N-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, whilst immunoblotting of isolated renal cortex protein demonstrated reduced E-cadherin expression, with increased expression of β-catenin. Restoration of expression of the adherens junction proteins in the Cx43 +/-UUO model supports our earlier findings where Cx43 block diminished hemichannel mediated ATP release. However, whilst changes in expression of our adherens junction proteins were recapitulated in vivo, minimal change was observed for tight junction protein Claudin-2. Despite this, ZO-1 expression was decreased in vitro and in vivo, an effect restored when hPTEC cells were co-incubated with Peptide 5, or Cx43 activity was suppressed (Cx43 +/-). The importance of this to tubular function and subsequent injury, is supported by observations, which suggest that ZO-1 is a critical regulator of tight junction assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, with loss of expression linked to defects in tight junction assembly and a severely disrupted paracellular barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Although not present in the mature adherens junction complex, tight junction biogenesis is characterized by an interaction between ZO-1 and cadherins, an association which allows for fusion of belt-like tight junctions and gap junction formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In addition, in its capacity as a scaffolding protein, ZO-1 directly facilitates Cx43 mediated gap junction formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Thus, restoration of ZO-1 expression, through blockade of Cx43 hemichannel mediated ATP release, has potential to not just restore barrier function, but to maintain cell-to-cell adhesion through efficient adherens junction formation, blockade of EMT and restoration of direct GJIC.</p><p>With an imbalance in ATP signalling &amp;/or degradation linked to the underlying pathology of multiple diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, we investigated a role for downstream purinergic signalling in driving these Cx43 hemichannel mediated events. ATP signals via activation of membrane-bound purinoreceptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Increased activation of purinergic receptors, notably P2X7, has been linked to inflammatory damage in the renal vasculature, glomerulus and tubular regions in multiple experimental models of kidney disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. In diabetic nephropathy, P2X7 expression is associated with mesangial expansion and impaired glomerular filtration <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, whilst genetic and pharmacological (AZ11657312) ablation of P2X7 in a mouse model of Type I diabetes impaired glomerular macrophage infiltration and decreased collagen IV deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. In human biopsy material from people with diabetic nephropathy and in tubules isolated from the UUO mouse model, we observed a significant upregulation of P2X7 expression, an effect which was blunted when Cx43 expression was genetically reduced (Cx43 +/-/UUO). Peptide 5, has been shown to negate inflammation and associated tissue damage in multiple systems of disease, specifically those where initial pathology appears perpetuated by activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Upregulated in classic immune cells (e.g. infiltrating macrophages) and tubular epithelial cells of the kidney, the NLRP3 inflammasome is a protein complex involved in initiating the innate immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, with activation linked to a variety of glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Although pharmacological inhibition negates inflammation and improves overall tissue function in a host of inflammatory conditions, lack of understanding of structure and underlying regulatory mechanisms of NLRP3 has hindered the discovery and development of successful therapeutics <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</p><p>Stimulated by age-related Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including excess ATP, P2X7 mediated activation of the NLRP3 complex triggers a cascade of events that culminate in secretion of downstream pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. A recent study in acute renal injury confirmed that the Cx43 +/-mouse exhibits reduced renal NLRP3 expression and decreased serum levels of IL-1β as compared to its wildtype control <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Moreover, NLRP3 activation has recently been linked to induction of EMTand diminished ECAD expression in multiple cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>, whilst Cx43 mediated NLRP3 activation initiates breakdown and disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) at the back of the diabetic eye <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. In addition, with priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome linked to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, combined with reports that NF-κB activation binding to the Cx43 gene promoter directly increases Cx43 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, it is possible that inflammasome pathway priming parallels increased Cx43 expression, further perpetuating aberrant Cx43 mediated ATP release <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The current study confirms that specific inhibition of P2X7 in PTECS coincubated with TGF-β1 +/-P2X7 inhibitor A438079 or A804598, negates TGF-β1-evoked changes in expression of EMT markers, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Claudin-2 and ZO-1. In addition, using AFM-SCFS, we have recently shown that the ATPγS induced downregulation of Ecadherin expression in proximal kidney cells, is paralleled by a P2X7 mediated reduction in intercellular ligation forces, decreased tether rupture events and cytoskeletal remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Combined with observations that Peptide 5 negates TGF-β1 induced disassembly of the adherens junction and tight junction complex, our findings suggest that TGF-β1 evoked changes in Cx43 mediated ATP likely initiates P2X7 mediated tubular injury and EMT via an NLRP3 dependent mechanism.</p><p>However, although blockade of P2X7 and an impaired ATP driven response clearly supports a role for purinergic mediated signalling in early tubular injury, recent clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of P2X7 antagonism in numerous inflammatory illnesses, an effect most likely linked to the genetic variation within the P2X7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. With aberrant Cx43 activity linked to activation of P2X7 and NLRP3, targeting aberrant Cx43 mediated hemichannel ATP release clearly represents a future therapeutic avenue for the treatment of chronic kidney disease and other conditions where inflammation appears to be the underlying pathology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our study is the first to provide insight into the initiating trigger of early phenotypic changes, which predispose cells of the injured proximal tubule to tubular injury. Elevated levels of TGF-β1 increase Cx43 hemichannel mediated ATP release, an effect which drives P2X7 mediated phenotypic changes linked to initiation of EMT in the tubular region of the kidney. With previous work in the Cx43 +/-UUO model linking reduced Cx43 expression to diminished levels of extracellular matrix deposition, fibroblast activation and macrophage infiltration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the current study utilises Peptide 5 and confirms that the protective effects as observed in the Cx43 +/-UUO mouse, appear to stem from inhibition of aberrant Cx43 mediated hemichannel ATP release. In conclusion, Cx43 represents, a viable therapeutic intervention for tubular damage in late stage CKD via restoration of the phenotypic and functional changes that culminate in an inflammatory and fibrotic phenotype.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 TGF-β1 regulates the expression of adherens and tight junction proteins in cultured human renal tubule cells.
