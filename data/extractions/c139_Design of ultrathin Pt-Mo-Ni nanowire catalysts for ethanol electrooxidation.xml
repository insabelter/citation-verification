<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Developing cost-effective, active, and durable electrocatalysts is one of the most important issues for the commercialization of fuel cells. Ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni nanowires (NWs) with a diameter of ~2.5 nm and lengths of up to several micrometers were synthesized via a H 2 -assisted solution route (HASR). This catalyst was designed on the basis of the following three points: (i) ultrathin NWs with high numbers of surface atoms can increase the atomic efficiency of Pt and thus decrease the catalyst cost; (ii) the incorporation of Ni can isolate Pt atoms on the surface and produce surface defects, leading to high catalytic activity (the unique structure and superior activity were confirmed by spherical aberration-corrected electron microscopy measurements and ethanol oxidation tests, respectively); and (iii) the incorporation of Mo can stabilize both Ni and Pt atoms, leading to high catalytic stability, which was confirmed by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the developed HASR strategy can be extended to synthesize a series of Pt-Mo-M (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ru, etc.) NWs. These multimetallic NWs would open up new opportunities for practical fuel cell applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the past decades, considerable attention has been paid to highperformance fuel cells, which directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy with high efficiency and do not emit harmful gases. Among several kinds of fuel cells, direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) have gained attention because of their high energy density, high conversion efficiency, light weight, and relatively low operating temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxidation and vulnerable CO poisoning effect hamper its applications in the practical fuel cell and thus activate extensive research interests in this area.</p><p>Platinum (Pt) is one of the most commonly used electrocatalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. To promote the eventual large-scale commercialization of fuel cells, efforts have been devoted to improving Pt-based materials to obtain costeffective, active, and durable electrocatalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. From the point of Pt atomic efficiency, one effective approach to decreasing the cost of electrocatalysts is to construct one-dimensional (1D) ultrathin nanowires (NWs) (with a typical diameter of less than 5 nm), which have inherent anisotropic morphology with high numbers of surface atoms and thus decrease the Pt utilization per mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. From the point of catalytic activity and durability, incorporating a second metal into the Pt lattice to form bimetallic nanocrystals (NCs) is an effective way to modify the electron structure of Pt and thus tune the activity and durability of electrocatalysts. For example, Pt-Pd NCs with porous features are more active than Pt black catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> have demonstrated that doping the NCs with Mo can enhance the catalytic stability of electrocatalysts. Together, it is highly desirable to design multimetallic ultrathin Pt-based NW electrocatalysts with decreasing Pt utilization, superior activity, and durability.</p><p>To date, Pt-based NW electrocatalysts have been achieved through several approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>. For example, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> demonstrated a galvanic replacement method for preparing Pt-Te alloy NWs using ultrathin Te NWs as both reducing agent and sacrificial template in ethylene glycol. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> synthesized ultrathin Pt-Fe NWs with a diameter of ~2.5 nm and lengths ranging from 30 to 100 nm in a mixed solution of 1-octadecene, oleylamine (OAm), and sodium oleate. However, multimetallic Pt-based ultrathin NWs with an ultrahigh aspect ratio (a diameter of less than 3 nm and lengths of several micrometers) are difficult to synthesize and stabilize <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. This is because, on the one hand, Pt atoms tend to form face-centered cubic (fcc) close-packed crystal structures during the crystal growth process; on the other hand, it is still difficult to control the reduction and nucleation process of multiple metal precursors at the same time due to their different reduction potentials. Here, we report an efficient H 2 -assisted solution route (HASR) to synthesize ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs with a diameter of 2.5 nm and lengths of several micrometers. By combining the advantages of ultrathin 1D morphology, rich surface defects, and optimal metal compositions, the as-prepared Pt-Mo-Ni NWs exhibit better catalytic activity and durability toward ethanol electrooxidation than do commercial Pt black and Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the HASR strategy can be extended to the preparation of other Pt-Mo-M (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ru, etc.) NWs, paving the way for the design and synthesis of advanced ultrathin multimetallic electrocatalysts and for potential applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Pt-Mo-Ni NWs were typically synthesized through thermal decomposition of Mo(CO) 6 and reduction of Pt(acac) 2 and Ni(acac) 2 under H 2 atmosphere. The mixture was heated to 180°C and kept at this temperature for 10 hours (see Materials and Methods). The Pt-Mo-Ni NWs were obtained after washing and centrifugation. In this approach, H 2 serves as both reductant and structure-directing species, playing a key role in the formation of high-quality ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>, the continuous lattice fringes and selected-area fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern reveal the single-crystalline nature of the Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, and the growth direction of the NW was along the &lt;110&gt; direction. The d-spacing for the adjacent lattice fringes measured was 0.22 nm, indicating the {111} facet of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs. Moreover, different brightness along the wires can be seen, where dark dots segregated at the edges of the NWs and bright dots appeared more centrally located. This observation indicates that the NWs with edges rich in Ni, Mo, and Pt on the surface were isolated by the Ni atoms (marked by arrows). Figure <ref type="figure">1E</ref> shows the 3D HAADF-STEM intensity profiles, which exhibit uneven element distribution and defect-rich surface structure of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs. The unique element distribution of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs was further confirmed by energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) elemental mapping (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>). The discrete Ni image indicates that Ni atoms can isolate Pt atoms on the surface. We carried out a powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment to identify the internal crystalline structure of the as-obtained products. As shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>, the three distinct diffraction patterns could be indexed to the {111}, {200}, and {220} planes of the fcc structure. The XRD peak positions of the Pt-Mo-Ni NWs shifted to a higher angle compared to those of pure Pt, which could be attributed to the decreased lattice spacing that results from the replacement of Pt atoms by smaller Ni or Mo atoms. No detectable impurity peaks were detected in the XRD pattern, further indicating that only a single Pt-Mo-Ni phase exists in the product. The Pt/Mo/Ni atomic ratio determined by EDX analysis was 0.75:0.07:0.18 (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>), which agreed with the result from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.</p><p>To understand the local atomic and electronic structures of the Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, we carried out ex situ x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> shows the normalized Pt L 3 -edge XANES spectra of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, with PtO 2 and Pt foil for reference. The oxidation state of Pt species can be monitored by white light intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, so the increased intensity of the Pt-Mo-Ni white line peak (at about 11572 eV, involving 2p-to-empty 5d transition) indicates that Pt in Pt-Mo-Ni is slightly oxidized compared with Pt foil. We can obtain additional information from the EXAFS spectra of the Pt L 3 -edge, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>. A small shoulder peak between 1.5 and 2.0 Å is found, which is derived from Pt-O coordination, also suggesting that Pt is mildly oxidized at the surface of the NWs, agreeing well with the XANES curves of Pt. The main peak located at 2.6 Å of the Pt L 3 -edge spectra represents the nearest coordination shells of Pt atoms. The weaker intensity and shorter position of the main peak in Pt-Mo-Ni NWs indicate lesser first coordination number and shorter bond length than those of Pt foil due to alloying effects. The discrepancy of the oscillations in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4A</ref> also indicates that the coordination environment of Pt in Pt-Mo-Ni NWs and Pt foil is quite different, because the phase of the EXAFS and the shape of the amplitude envelope provide information about the scatterer type <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. The normalized Ni K-edge XANES spectra of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, NiO bulk, and Ni foil are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>. Both the absorption edge position and white line peak intensity of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs are between that of NiO bulk and Ni foil. This indicates that the Ni oxidation state for Pt-Mo-Ni NWs is between Ni 0 and Ni 2+ , which is consistent with the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results (fig. <ref type="figure">S11</ref>). Moreover, the Ni K-edge XANES spectra indicates that there may be two Ni species in the as-prepared Pt-Mo-Ni NWs: one in nickel oxide and one in Pt-Mo-Ni alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. The peak between 2.0 and 2.9 Å in the Ni K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>; the EXAFS oscillation functions are also given in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4B</ref>) is quite obvious, and we cannot simply assign it to just one scattering path. Referring to the Ni K-edge FT spectra of NiO and Ni foil, the peak at 2.0 to 2.9 Å may belong to the combination of two scattering paths: Ni-Ni scattering in NiO and Ni-Pt/Mo/Ni scattering in Pt-Mo-Ni alloy, similar to the result obtained from the XANES analysis of the Ni K-edge. Notably, there are also two Mo species in the Pt-Mo-Ni sample using the XANES and EXAFS discussion of the Mo K-edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). The XANES feature of Pt-Mo-Ni is obviously different from Mo foil and MoO 2 . The atomic structure of some Mo in the NWs is similar to that of MoO 3 , with the appearance of the shoulder peak near the absorption edge for both Pt-Mo-Ni and MoO 3 . The Mo K-edge position of Pt-Mo-Ni shifts to lower energy than does that of MoO 2 and MoO 3 because a part of Mo in the NWs is dispersed in the lattice of Pt and Ni, which is also demonstrated by EXAFS oscillation function and FT-EXAFS curve, as shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2F</ref>, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. Additional information on the fitting results of the Pt L 3 -edge, Ni K-edge, and Mo K-edge is provided in the Supplementary Materials (figs. S5 to S10 and tables S1 to S3).</p><p>Here, we report for the first time the synthesis of ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs using the HASR strategy. Previous research shows that H 2 has a positive impact on the formation of anisotropic and faceted particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. To examine whether H 2 was involved in the formation of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, we performed the synthesis of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs under H 2 -depleted conditions, in which an air atmosphere (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S12</ref>) or nitrogensaturated (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S13</ref>) reaction solution was used and all other procedures were kept unchanged. Notably, we could not obtain ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs in the absence of H 2 and instead only yielded products with mixed morphologies (for example, nanoparticles, worm-like nanoparticles, and a small number of NWs), suggesting that the presence of H 2 may manipulate the growth kinetics of the reaction and thus tailor the size and morphology of the products. Moreover, when we accelerate the reaction rate by directly elevating the reaction temperature to 180°C, poor quality of NWs and a large amount of ultrasmall nanoparticles were obtained (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S14</ref>). The results further confirmed that the slow growth rate controlled by H 2 is critical to the formation of well-defined Pt-Mo-Ni NWs. To better understand the formation mechanism of the Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, we analyzed a series of samples collected at various stages of the reaction. When the reaction was performed at 50°C, the solution color became green and no products were obtained. With the elevation of the temperature from 50°to 120°C, the solution displayed gradual color evolution from green to dark green. This change suggests that the products started to form during the process. The ultrathin NWs were obtained at the bottom of the flask with a diameter of around 1 nm at 120°C (fig. <ref type="figure">S15</ref>). The molar ratio of Pt/Mo/Ni was determined to be 0.95:0.03:0.02. The red upper solution of the products collected at 120°C suggests that there are still amounts of Ni precursors present in the solution, as confirmed by ICP-MS. Furthermore, when the temperature was increased to 180°C, the solution turned black and a higher yield of NWs was achieved. TEM image shows that the morphology of NWs did not change (fig. <ref type="figure">S16</ref>), but the particle size increased with more Ni incorporation into Pt-rich NWs. The molar ratio of Pt/Mo/Ni collected at 180°C was 0.83:0.05:0.12, implying that the reduction of Ni(acac) 2 dominated the later growth process. When the reaction time was extended to 10 hours, well-defined Pt-Mo-Ni NWs were formed (fig. <ref type="figure">S17</ref>), and the molar ratio of Pt/Mo/Ni atoms was 0.75:0.07:0.18, which agreed with the final obtained composition. On the basis of the above results, a mechanism for the formation of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs can be summarized as follows (fig. <ref type="figure">S18</ref>): Beginning at 120°C, the Pt precursor is reduced to zero-value Pt atoms because of their high standard reduction potentials, and these Pt atoms will nucleate and grow to form Pt-rich NWs with the assistance of H 2 . Here, H 2 serves as both the reduction and structure-directing species for controlling the reaction rate and further inducing the formation of NWs. The low packing density of OAm at the tip leads to the formation of NW, with two large nanoparticles on both ends. Upon increasing the reaction temperature (180°C), the zerovalue Pt can further induce the stepwise reduction of Ni 2+ to Ni, and the formed Ni together with Mo atoms will then be adsorbed on the surface of Pt-rich NWs because the obtained intermediates have a higher surface energy. The subsequent growth does not change the overall NW morphology. After consumption of the metal precursors, the resultant stable phase of Pt-Mo-Ni is formed.</p><p>To elucidate the catalytic properties and potential applications of asobtained ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, we chose ethanol electrooxidation  ethanol oxidation in the Pt-Mo-Ni NW catalysts. For specific activities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>), the ethanol oxidation current density of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs (2.57 mA cm -2 ) is 13.4 times that of the Pt/C catalyst (0.19 mA cm -2 ) and 11.2 times that of the Pt black catalyst (0.23 mA cm -2 ). With regard to mass activities, the current densities of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs (865.8 mA mg -1 ) are 16.6 and 6.3 times those of Pt black (52.2 mA mg -1 ) and Pt/C (137.5 mA mg -1 ) catalysts. To further evaluate the stability of these catalysts, chronoamperometry (CA) curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>) were recorded and compared. The as-prepared Pt-Mo-Ni NWs exhibited higher durability during the electrochemical measurements than did the commercial Pt black and Pt/C catalysts. In situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were performed to investigate the structural stability of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs. The in situ XAFS of the Pt L 3 -edge and Ni K-edge was carried out at the 1W1B station in the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) (a homemade electrochemical cell was used for in situ XAS measurements; all the data were recorded by a Lytle detector shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S20, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>), and the in situ experiment of the Mo K-edge was performed at the 14W1 station in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) (the spectra were collected using a solid-state detector shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S20, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). The XAFS curves of the Pt L 3 -edge, Ni K-edge, and Mo K-edge were recorded at different voltages (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6V). The atomic structure evolution of Pt, Ni, and Mo can be observed through the change of the FT-EXAFS curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, D to F), as well as the XANES spectra (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S21, A, C,</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>) and EXAFS oscillation functions (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S21, B, D,</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). The local atomic structure of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs was kept stable in the catalytic reaction process. The morphology and composition of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs were characterized after the reaction, which further confirmed the stable structure of the catalysts (for details, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E see figs. S22 to S24</head><p>). To further verify the activities of Pt-Mo-Ni in the DEFC experiments, we also conducted a single-cell test. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S25</ref> shows the corresponding steady-state polarization curves for Pt-Mo-Ni NWs and Pt/C catalysts. A higher maximum power density was obtained in the cell with Pt-Mo-Ni as the anode catalyst. Specifically, the maximum power density of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs at 60°and 80°C is 2.7 and 3.6 mW cm -2 , respectively, which is higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst.</p><p>The improvement of the catalytic activity and stability of the Pt-Mo-Ni NWs could be attributed to the following reasons. First, ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs with rich surface defects have high density of low-coordinated atoms, which not only decrease the Pt utilization per mass but also facilitate the oxidation of ethanol through a more effective way. Second, incorporation of 3d transition metals (Ni) into the Pt lattice to form ternary Pt-Mo-Ni NWs can promote the adsorption of hydroxyl species from water and then the removal of the poisoned CO intermediates at a lower potential compared to Pt/C and Pt black catalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. To further confirm this point, we conducted CO stripping (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S26</ref>) experiments. The peak potential of CO oxidation was in the order of Pt/C (0.64 V versus SCE) &gt; Pt black (0.57 V versus SCE) &gt; Pt-Mo-Ni (0.46 V versus SCE), indicating that the Pt-Mo-Ni catalysts have the priority in CO oxidation. Furthermore, the product testing results of this reaction indicated that the addition of a Ni element may probably favor the C-C bond activation and also the oxidation of adsorbates and/ or intermediates to CO 2 . Third, we carried out the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the step edges of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs to elucidate the role of Mo and its stability in the Pt-Ni alloys (for details, see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S27</ref> and table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). The atomic cohesive energies, E coh , of the Mo, whether at the surface (6.84 eV) or in the subsurface (8.61 or 8.42 eV), are larger than those of the Ni (5.58 eV) and Pt (5.67 eV). Both spatial confinement and energetic preference allow the Mo to be always retained in Pt-Ni NWs. Hence, the subsurface Mo atoms will increase the E coh of the Ni by 0.27 eV and of the Pt by 0.29 eV. This indicates that Mo has a stabilizing effect on undercoordinated sites of Pt-Ni NWs, which are the available sites for reactions. All these are attributed to the formation of relatively strong Mo-Pt and Mo-Ni bonds instead of Pt-Ni bonds. In this case, introducing Mo atoms in NWs fundamentally stabilizes both Ni and Pt atoms against dissolution and diffusion, which endow the catalyst with enhanced durability.</p><p>In addition to the ethanol electrooxidation of Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, we also applied the ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs as superior counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As shown in table <ref type="table">S5</ref>, the Pt-Mo-Ni CEs have better efficiency than the Pt film CEs in DSSCs under AM1.5G (air mass 1.5 global) simulated solar light (100 mW cm -2 ) (for more details, see figs. S28 to S31). The above result shows that trimetallic Pt-Mo-Ni NWs can act as potential multifunctional materials with high catalytic performance.</p><p>More importantly, the developed HASR strategy was also effective in the synthesis of other ultrathin ternary Pt-Mo-M (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ru, etc.) NWs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 (A, C, E,</ref> and<ref type="figure">G</ref>) shows typical STEM images of the as-prepared Pt-Mo-Fe, Pt-Mo-Co, Pt-Mo-Mn, and Pt-Mo-Ru NWs, respectively. It was clear that all the NWs exhibit ultrathin and ultralong characteristics and that part of them were spontaneously self-assembled into bundles. This is similar to what is seen in Pt-Mo-Ni NWs, indicating that the varied composition does not change the overall morphology of NWs. The unique structures and compositions of the prepared NWs are also visualized by EDX (figs. S32 to S35) and elemental mapping analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4, B, D, F,</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). It can be observed that Pt, Mo, and M elements are distributed throughout the nanostructures, confirming the alloyed structure of the Pt-Mo-M NWs.</p><p>In conclusion, we successfully synthesized ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni trimetallic NWs through a HASR strategy and demonstrated that H 2 is responsible for the well-controlled preparation of ultrathin trimetallic NWs. Spherical aberration-corrected electron microscopy together with XAFS measurements confirmed the unique surface structure of as-prepared ultrathin NWs. Ni can isolate Pt atoms on the surface and produce surface defects, whereas Mo can stabilize these undercoordinated sites. Thus, the ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni NWs showed high catalytic activity and substantially enhanced stability. Moreover, the developed HASR strategy can also be applied to synthesize a series of Pt-Mo-M (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ru, etc.) NWs. We envision that this work will provide new insights into rational design and synthesis of cost-effective, active, and durable electrocatalysts.</p></div>
