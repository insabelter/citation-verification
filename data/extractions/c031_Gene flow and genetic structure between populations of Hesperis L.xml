<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Genetic variability and populations , structure were studied in seven geographical populations of Hesperis L. Genetic diversity parameters were determined in these populations. 5 of 10 random amplified polymorphic DNA primers produced 62 reproducible bands with average of 7.1 bands per primer and 55% of polymorphism. Hesperis hyrcana showed the highest number of effective allele (Ne), Shannon index (I) and genetic diversity (H). The highest values of genetic diversity were obtained in Hesperis hyrcana. NJ trees grouped the populations in two different clusters/groups, indicating their genetic difference which is discussed in details. The results of this study showed that the level of genetic variation in Hesperis is relatively high. NJ-based dendrogram showed a close relationship between members of Hesperis straussii and Hesperis hyrcana while the Hesperis luristanica protected population differ the most from the other populations. Principal component analysis, however, showed some minor differences with NJ-based dendrograms.</p></div>

Understanding of genetic variability and inter-, and intra-population diversity of rare and endemic species is therefore necessary for their conservation and management (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">CIRES et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2013)</ref>. The genus Hesperis L. (Brassicaceae) comprises biennial and perennial herbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(DURAN et al., 2003)</ref> and consists of 46 species worldwide <ref type="bibr">(AL-SHEHBAZ et al., 2006)</ref>, mainly occurring in different parts of Europe, Caucasus, Transcaucasia, and to a lesser extent in northern and central Asia, and mostly in Turkey with 28 species <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(DURAN, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">ARAS et al., 2009)</ref>. The genus is represented by 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DVOŘÁK, 1968)</ref> or six species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ASSADI et al., 2017)</ref> belonging to sections Hesperis Dvořák, Diaplictos Dvořák and Pachycarpos Fourn. in Iran. The first subgeneric <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DVOŘÁK, 1973)</ref> and sectional (ANDRZEJOWSKI, 1821) studies of Hesperis were evaluated from morphological, cytological, and palynological characters, but still taxonomists try to introduce new infrageneric classifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(DURAN, 2016)</ref>. Hesperis can be readily distinguished from the rest of the Brassicaceae by having stalked glands with uniseriate stalks terminated with a unicellular gland <ref type="bibr">(AL-SHEHBAZ et al., 2006)</ref>. Among palynological, cytological and trichome characters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">DURAN et al. (2003)</ref> used traditional morphological characters, e.g., life form, stem height, leaf shape, and diverse fruit characters for sectional classification. The genus was firstly revised by ANDRZEJOWSKI (1821) and he placed the genus in a single section (Deilosma Andrz.). Later, the taxonomy of the genus was treated by several researchers and the genus was divided into various sections on the basis of morphological characters; 2 sections (Hesperidium DC. and Deilosma Andrz.) by DE CANDOLLE (1824), 3 sections (Hesperidium, Deilosma and Pachycarpos Fourn. Emend. Tzvelev) by FOURNIER (1866) and TZVELEV <ref type="bibr">(1959)</ref>, and 2 sections (sect. Purpureae Boiss. and Lividae Boiss.) by BOISSIER <ref type="bibr">(1867)</ref>. DVORAK <ref type="bibr">(1973)</ref> separated it into 5 subgenera (Hesperis, Mediterranea Borbas, Cvelevia Dvorak, Contorta Dvorak and Diaplictos Dvorak). CULLEN <ref type="bibr">(1965)</ref> did not divide the species of the genus growing in Turkey into sections. Despite numerous studies on the infragenetic and infraspecific classification of the genus, problems have not been clarified yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(SAVULESCU, 1955)</ref>. Previous study on species delimitation and species relationship performed in this genus.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">ARAS et al., (2009)</ref> the phylogenetic relations among infraspecific, specific and supraspecific categories of 6 taxa of the genus Hesperis collected from different parts of Turkey were investigated by RAPD analysis. Their results of the RAPD analysis support the idea that H. bicuspidata (Sect. Hesperis), H. schischkinii (Sect. Mediterranea), H. pendula (Sect. Pachycarpos), H. breviscapa, H. kotschyi (Sect. Cvelevia) and H. cappadocica (Sect. Contorta) species need to be placed into different sections according to morphological characters.</p><p>After Turkey, Iran is the second country in terms of Hesperis diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ASSADI et al., 2017)</ref> and despite several infrageneric and infraspecific studies of Hesperis, its taxonomic problems have not been resolved yet. But there are no attempt to study genetic diversity, ecological adaptation and intra-and inter-specific differentiation along with morphometric studies on Hesperis of Iran. Therefore, we performed morphological and molecular study of 60 collected specimens of 3 species in Hesperis. Molecular markers are considered an important tool in order to provide data in terms of genetic polymorphisms between different individuals in a population. Molecular markers are commonly used in genetic analysis, fingerprinting, linkage mapping, germplasm characterization, and molecular breeding. RAPD analysis using PCR along with short arbitrary sequence primers has been reported sensitive to detecting variation at level of individuals. The benefits of this method are: a) a large number of samples are tested easily and efficiently using less quantity of material; b) the DNA amplicons are independent of ontogenetic expression; c) several genomic regions may be sampled with likely infinite numbers of markers <ref type="bibr">(SONIYA et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">a, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017c</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017d)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DNA Extraction and RAPD Assay</head><p>In each of the populations studied, fresh leaves from one to twelve plants were used randomly. Leaves were dried with silica gel prior to DNA extraction. In order to obtain genomic DNA, the CTAB-activated charcoal protocol was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2019)</ref>. By running on 0.8 percent agarose gel, the quality of extracted DNA was examined. A total of 25 Operon Technology Decamer RAPD Primers (Alameda, Canada) belonging to OPA, OPB, OPC, OPD sets were used. Among them, five primers were selected with simple, enlarged and rich bands of polymorphism (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). PCR reactions were performed in a 25μl volume mixture containing the following component: Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM) at pH 8; KCl (50 mM); MgCl2 (1.5 mM); dNTPs (0.2 mM); primer (0.2 μM); genomic DNA (20 ng) and of Taq DNA polymerase (3 U). In Techne thermocycler (Germany), the amplification reactions were carried out with the following PCR settings: 5 min initial denaturation at 94 °C; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 52-57 °C and 2 min at 72 °C. The reaction was completed by 7-10 min extension at 72 °C. The PCR amplified products were detected by running on 1% agarose gel, preceded by staining with ethidium bromide. The size of fragments was measured using a ladder with a molecular size of 100 bp (Fermentas, Germany).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular Analyses</head><p>The obtained RAPD bands were coded as binary characters (absence = 0, presence = 1) and used for the study of genetic diversity. Using two parameters, marker index (MI), and polymorphism information content (PIC), the discriminatory capacity of primers was evaluated to characterize the ability of each primer to identify polymorphic loci among the genotypes <ref type="bibr">(Powell et al. 1996)</ref>. For each primer, MI was calculated as MI = PIC × EMR, where EMR is the product of the number of polymorphic loci per primer (n), and the polymorphic fragment fraction (β) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(HEIKRUJAM et al., 2015)</ref>. For each primer, the number of polymorphic bands (NPB) was determined followed by the effective multiplex ratio (EMR). Other parameters such as Nei's gene diversity (H), Shannon information index (I), number of effective alleles, and percentage of polymorphism (P% = number of polymorphic loci/number of total loci) were also determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(WEISING et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">FREELAND et al., 2011)</ref>. The formula for calculation of Shannon's index was: H' = -Σpiln pi. Rp is defined per primer as: Rp = ∑ Ib, where "Ib" is the band informativeness, that takes the values of 1-(2x [0.5-p]), being "p" the proportion of each genotype containing the band.

The Mantel test determined the correlation between the geographical and genetic distances of the populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(PODANI, 2000)</ref>. These tests were performed in PAST ver. 2.17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(HAMMER et al., 2012)</ref> and DARwin software ver. 5 (2012). As implemented in GenAlex 6.4 (PEAKALL and SMOUSE, 2006), the AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) test (with 1000 permutations) was used to evaluate population genetic differences. Gene flow was estimated by calculating Nm, an estimate of gene flow from Gst in PopGene ver. <ref type="bibr">1.32 (1997)</ref> as: Nm = 0.5 (1 -Gst)/Gst. This method considers the equal amount of gene flow among all populations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species identity and relationships Morphometry</head><p>ANOVA test showed substantial differences (P &lt;0.01) between the studied species in quantitative morphological characteristics. PCA analysis was conducted to determine the most variable characters among the taxa analysed. It showed that over 64 % of the overall variance was composed of the first three variables. Characters such as seed shape, calyx shape, calyx length, bract length and basal leaf shape have shown the highest association (&gt;0.7) in the first PCA axis with 43 percent of total variance. Characters affecting PCA axis 2 and 3 respectively were seed colour, leaf surface, corolla length, filament length, basal leaf length. Different ordination and clustering methods generated similar results. Therefore, PCoA plot of morphological characters are presented here (Figs 1). Samples of each species were separately grouped. This finding indicates that the studied species were divided into different classes by both quantitative and qualitative morphological features. Among the studies sample we did not find any intermediate forms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species Identification and Genetic Diversity</head><p>Five RAPD primers were screened in order to study genetic relationships within Hesperis. All primers generated reproducible polymorphic bands in three Hesperis species. In total, 62 amplified polymorphic bands were produced across three species. The size range of the amplified fragments was 100 to 3000 bp. The highest and lowest number of polymorphic bands was 18 for OPD-02 and 8 for OPC-04 with an average of 6.2 polymorphic bands per primer. The PIC of the five RAPD primers ranged from 0.43 (OPC-04) to 0.59 (OPB-01) with an average of 0.55 per primer. MI of the primers ranged from 3.25 (OPB-01) to 3.88 (OPC-04) with an average of 3.5 per primer. EMR of the RAPD primers ranged from 4.22 (OPB-01) to 8.56 (OPD-02) with an average of 7.87 per primer (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The primers with the high EMR values were considered to be more informative in distinguishing the genotypes.</p><p>Genetic parameters were determined for all the 3 Hesperis species amplified with RAPD primers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The range of Unbiased expected heterozygosity (H) was 0.23 (Hesperis straussii) to 0.31 (Hesperis hyrcana) (mean: 0.28). A similar trend was depicted by Shannon's information index (I), with the highest value of 0.39 found in (Hesperis hyrcana) and the lowest value of 0.14 found in (Hesperis straussii) (mean: 0.30). The observed number of alleles (Na) varied between 0.261 in Hesperis straussii and 0.555 in Hesperis hyrcana. The range of effective number of alleles (Ne) was 1.014 (Hesperis straussii) to 1.042 (Hesperis luristanica). AMOVA test revealed substantial genetic variation (P = 0.01). It showed that 73% of total variation was interspecific and 27% was intra-specific (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In addition, genetic differentiation of was demonstrated by significant Nei's GST (0.654, P = 0.001) and D_est values (0.433, P = 0.01). Compared to intra-species, these results revealed a greater distribution of interspecific genetic diversity.  Different clustering and ordination methods produced similar results therefore, only MDS plot and NJ dendrograms of RAPD data are presented here (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>). In general, plant samples of each species were grouped together and formed a separate group. This result shows that RAPD data can delimit Hesperis species. In the studied specimens we did not encounter intermediate forms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>Two main clusters were produced in the NJ tree (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The first main cluster comprised of: Hesperis straussii and Hesperis hyrcana were separated from the rest of the species and join the others with a great distance and comprised the first cluster. The second cluster comprised of; Hesperis luristanica. Relationships obtained from RAPD data usually agree well with the relationship of species obtained from morphological data. This is in accordance with the parameters of AMOVA and genetic diversity previously reported. Hesperis species are genetically well distinguished from each other. These findings show that RAPD molecular markers can be used in the taxonomy of Hesperis species. The Nm analysis by Popgene software also produced mean Nm= 0.643, that is deemed a low value of gene flow. A strong association (r = 0.543, p=0.0002) between genetic-and geographical distance was demonstrated by Mantel test with 5000 permutations. It indicates that isolation by distance (IBD) has occurred among these species.</p><p>The results of Nei's genetic identity and the genetic distance (Table not included) show the highest genetic similarity (0.74) between Hesperis straussii and Hesperis hyrcana. Lowest of genetic similarity was shown between Hesperis straussii and Hesperis luristanica (0.50). Lower Nm value (0.643) is an indicator of limited gene flow or ancestrally shared alleles between different species and indicating high genetic differentiation among and within Hesperis species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C</head><p>T E D NJ tree of RAPD data revealing species delimitation in the Hesperis species STRUCTURE analysis followed by Evanno test also produced delta K = 3. Therefore, we do have at least 3 genetic groups in the studied species: 1)specimens with green and blue segments. These are accessions of Hesperis straussii and Hesperis hyrcana and 2)specimens having red colored segments as dominant colour. These are accessions of Hesperis luristanica.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>Admixture ancestry model used in STRUCTURE revealed genetic affinity between Hesperis straussii and Hesperis hyrcana due to shared common alleles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). This is in agreement with NJ tree presented before. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Genetic diversity is a fundamental element of biodiversity and its conservation is indispensable for long-term survival of any species in unstable environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(MILLS and SCHWARTZ, 2005)</ref>. Genetic diversity is non-randomly distributed among different populations and is influenced by numerous factors such as geography, dispersal mechanisms, breeding systems, life span etc. Changes in environment often lead to variation in genetic diversity levels among populations, and under adverse circumstances, populations with little variability are generally deemed less adapted <ref type="bibr">(FALK and HOLSINGER, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">CONGFEN, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">ZHAO, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">XU, et al., 2021)</ref>. Most authors recognize that genetic diversity is fundamental to preserving the long-term evolutionary potential of a species <ref type="bibr">(FALK and HOLSINGER, 1991)</ref>. Experimental and field research has shown that habitat fragmentation and population decline have reduced the effective population size in the last decade. Similarly, majority of geneticists regard population size as a significant factor in preserving genetic variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(TURCHETTO et al., 2016)</ref>. In fragmented populations, this is very important because it is more vulnerable because of allelic richness loss and increased population differentiation via genetic drift and inbreeding depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(FRANKHAM, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">YANG, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">YIN, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">MIAO, et al., 2021)</ref>. Information of inter-and intra-population genetic diversity is therefore important for their conservation and management (e.g. <ref type="bibr">ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">2018d)</ref>.</p><p>We used morphological and molecular RAPD molecular data to test species relationships in Hesperis species in the current analysis. Morphological studies showed that both quantitative (the ANOVA test result) and qualitative characters are well distinguished from each other (The PCoA plot result). Furthermore, PCoA analysis suggests that morphological characters such as bract length, stipule length, bract shape, calyx shape, petal shape, stem-leaf length and width, petal length and width may be used in the delimitation of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>species groups. This morphological differentiation is attributed to quantitative and qualitative characters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic Structure and Gene Flow</head><p>A primer's PIC and MI characteristics assist in assessing its usefulness in the study of genetic diversity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">SIVAPRAKASH et al. (2004)</ref> asserted that the ability to overcome genetic diversity by a marker technique could be more explicitly linked to the degree of polymorphism. In general, the PIC value 0 to 0.25 suggests a very low genetic diversity among genotypes, a mid-level of genetic diversity between 0.25 and 0.50, and a value of 0.50 suggests a high level of genetic diversity, between 0.25 to 0.50 shows a mid-level of genetic diversity and value ≥0.50 indicates a high level of genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(TAMS et al. 2005)</ref>. In this study, the RAPD primers' PIC values ranged from 0.43 to 0.59, with a mean value of 0.55, indicating a moderate level ability of RAPD primers in determining genetic diversity.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">ARAS et al., (2009)</ref> the phylogenetic relations among infraspecific, specific and supraspecific categories of 6 taxa of the genus Hesperis collected from different parts of Turkey were investigated by RAPD analysis. Their results showed that the RAPD analysis support the idea that H. bicuspidata (Sect. Hesperis), H. schischkinii (Sect. Mediterranea), H. pendula (Sect. Pachycarpos), H. breviscapa, H. kotschyi (Sect. Cvelevia) and H. cappadocica (Sect. Contorta) species need to be placed into different sections according to morphological characters. On the other hand, the phylogenetic order of the sections according to morphological characters and according to molecular data displayed some differences and evolutionary phylogenetic orders of the sections were redesigned. The phylogenetic relations among species were based on the samples H. breviscapa and H. kotschyi which take place in the same section. The accordance of morphological and molecular similarities was noticed for H. breviscapa and H. kotschyi species. Besides this, infraspecific taxonomic situations of H. schischkinii samples having hairy and glabrous (non-hairy) fruits which show allopatric and sympatric spread were reassessed by RAPD analysis. In conclusion, the findings of this study showed that the primers derived from RAPD were more efficient than the other molecular markers in assessing the genetic diversity of Hesperis in Iran. In addition, the Hesperis species in the dendrogram and PCoA were clearly distinguished from each other, suggesting the greater efficiency of the RAPD technique in the identification of the genus. </p></div>
