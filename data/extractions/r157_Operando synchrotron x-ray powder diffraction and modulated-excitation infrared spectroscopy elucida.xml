<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While methanol (MeOH) synthesis via CO 2 hydrogenation might become practically relevant in the future thanks to advances in catalyst design, <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> this basic chemical is currently industrially produced from syngas (CO + 2H 2 QCH 3 OH) over aC u-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst at elevated pressures (5.0-10.0 MPa) and temperatures (473-573 K). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> Small amounts of CO 2 (ca. 3vol. %) are added to the syngas leading to a3-6 times enhancement of the MeOH formation rate. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> It is widely accepted that the so-called "CO 2 promotion" is related to the transformation of CO into CO 2 via the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO + H 2 OQCO 2 + H 2 )a nd its subsequent hydrogenation to MeOH (CO 2 + 3H 2 QCH 3 OH + H 2 O). <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Thel atter is much faster than the hydrogenation of CO but strongly limited by thermodynamics and product inhibition by H 2 Oa th igh CO 2 concentrations resulting in the typical volcano plot shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(described later). Klier et al. <ref type="bibr">[3a]</ref> speculated that an optimal oxidation state of Cu, i.e., partially oxidized, correlates with the top of the curve.This hypothesis has never been confirmed for commercial catalysts under reaction conditions and neglects the essential role of ZnO uncovered in the CO 2 promotion. <ref type="bibr">[3b]</ref> Multiple studies have revealed that zinc oxide strongly influences the CO 2 hydrogenation, acting as as tructural and electronic promoter for Cu. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> As indicated recently,t his reaction appears to be favored over the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) on ac omposite obtained by mechanical mixing of large particles of Cu and Al 2 O 3 with ZnO in aplate-like shape with respect to the case of am ixture containing rod-like ZnO crystallites, <ref type="bibr">[5d]</ref> based on the stronger electronic interactions between ZnO and Cu in the former catalyst. However,the relevance of the structure-function relationships derived in these works is limited by the use of model materials and/or ex situ characterization. Indeed, it has conclusively been demonstrated that only in situ and operando methods enable the detection of dynamic changes in the structure of heterogeneous catalysts at work which may be linked to the reaction mechanism. <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> As af irst step in this direction, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD), and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at (sub)ambient pressure have been applied over Cu supported on ZnO,e videncing that copper forms disc-like particles wetted by Zn atoms under strongly reducing gas mixtures (CO/H 2 )a nd spherical particles in the presence of H 2 Oa nd/or CO 2 . <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> Similar results were also obtained under WGS conditions while the effect of the ZnO morphology has not been assessed even though interactions between the Cu and ZnO phases were verified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[8]</ref> In addition, key intermediates of CO 2 hydrogenation could be detected on an industrial Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) at 3.0 MPa and 373-473 K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[9]</ref> Still, these analyses have not assessed structural and mechanistic aspects under industrially relevant pressures and temperatures to explain the CO 2 promotion for amulticomponent commercial catalyst.</p><p>Consequently,w ei nvestigated for the first time ac ommercial Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 material by operando SXRPD during hydrogenation of CO,C O 2 ,a nd CO/CO 2 to MeOH at 543 K and 5.0 MPa, using the composition leading to the maximal MeOH formation rate for the mixed syngas feed, to correlate changes of the particle morphology with the reaction rates. We derived mass distributions of the Cu and ZnO particles on the basis of their dimensions applying as ize-and shape-sensitive Debye function analysis (DFA). <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> This investigation uncovered morphological alterations occurring under CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 ,w hich differ from previous results gathered under conditions far from the industrial process.T he distinct MeOH yields observed in the CO 2 -promoted regime over the catalyst pretreated in CO/H 2 or CO 2 /H 2 were correlated with its WGS activity evidenced by operando modulated-excitation DRIFTS (ME-DRIFTS). Under CO/CO 2 /H 2 ,s pecific morphologies of Cu and ZnO were detected that facilitate the WGS reaction, thus identifying the structural reasons for the CO 2 promotion.</p><p>TheC u-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst herein studied was supplied in pelletized form. Thebasic characterization of this material is summarized in Tables <ref type="table">S1</ref> and<ref type="table">S2</ref> in the Supporting Information. Thef resh sample features am olar bulk ratio of Cu:Zn:Al = 6.0:2.6:1.3 (Cu:Zn:Al = 50.6:22.5:4.6 wt. %, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), am olar surface composition of Cu:Zn:Al:Mg:Ca = 6.0:5.1:1.3:1.1:0.3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), aB runauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 118 m<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> g cat À1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), ac opper surface area of 24.0 m 2 g cat À1 ,c rystalline Cu and ZnO particles exhibiting an average size of 4.9 and 6.4 nm, respectively,a nd an amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase.S canning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS) uncovered copper-, zinc-, aluminum-, and carbon-rich regions,i ndicating the heterogeneous composition of the material at the mms cale (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). TheM eOH space-time yield measured over this catalyst in af ixed-bed reactor set-up described elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[4d]</ref> exhibits the characteristic volcano-like trend upon stepwise replacing CO by CO 2 in the feed gas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) with amaximum for 2.4 vol. %ofCO 2 .</p><p>Aiming at explaining this intriguing and long-debated behavior, we designed ahome-made operando cell to conduct synchrotron-based XRPD investigations in Debye-Scherrer geometry under the same reaction conditions in order to follow the changes of the crystalline Cu and ZnO phases at the extremes of the volcano (CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 )a nd under the optimal gas mixture (CO/ CO 2 /H 2 ). Them ethodology of this structural analysis is shown and explained in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Briefly, afused-silica capillary fixed-bed reactor was housed in ah eating block enabling the detection of the diffracted beams and connected to ag as feeding system. Thec omposition of the gas at the reactor outlet was analyzed by an online mass spectrometer. Thecatalyst was initially exposed to CO/H 2 or CO 2 /H 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,t op and middle,r espectively) at 5.0 MPa, 543 K, and 15 000 h À1 .T he final MeOH concentration upon CO hydrogenation was ca. 50 %o ft hat during CO 2 hydrogenation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, top and middle,r espectively). The concentrations of the gas components in the operando studies indicated similar reaction rates as previously measured for this catalyst. <ref type="bibr">[4d]</ref> TheS XRPD patterns collected during the catalytic runs (Figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>) were matched through atomistic cluster simulations of the standard crystalline phases of Cu, Zn, and their oxides.T otal scattering methods such as the DFA <ref type="bibr">[10a]</ref> were applied as they enable am ore effective detection of subnanometer-sized particles and of their shapes with respect to classical approaches like profile analysis, <ref type="bibr">[10b,c,d]</ref> which is given in Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> for comparison. Thed iffractograms unveiled that the copper particles did not change their  cuboctahedral morphology upon exposure to the different gas compositions.Note that, in view of the high sensitivity of the synchrotron XRPD methodology,changes in the shape of the crystallites would have resulted in clearly detectable anisotropic broadening of the reflections.Wefurther confirmed the preservation of the cubic symmetry of the Cu phase by conducting modulated-excitation SXRPD (ME-SXRPD) experiments (Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref>), i.e., alternating the feed between CO/Ar and CO 2 /Ar or CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 under the abovementioned reaction conditions every 29 min. Such technique produces difference patterns with ah igher signal-to-noise ratio,t hus enabling the detection of subtle modifications of the crystallites,which may include surface changes in spite of the general bulk nature of XRPD.The retention of the shape of the Cu particles is in striking contrast to previous reports on an impregnated model Cu/ZnO catalyst, which claimed af lattening of the Cu crystallites in CO-containing atmospheres. <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> Theo rigin of this discrepancyl ikely is the 10-times lower Cu loading of that material with respect to our commercial bulk system and the application of (sub)ambient pressure during its analysis by SXRPD,X AS,a nd TEM. On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT) calculations exploring the impact of pressure on the morphology of supported metal nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[11]</ref> corroborate the spherical shape evidenced at 5.0 MPa.</p><p>In spite of the unaltered morphology,t he average size of Cu particles increased from 4.9 (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) to 6.0 and 7.1 nm under CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 , respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>,t op and middle). In the former case,s intering was gradual (Figure <ref type="figure">S6b</ref>) and likely favored by the segregation of Cu from ZnO,i ndicated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) (Figures 3d,t op,a nd S8), while it was rapid (Figure <ref type="figure">S6d</ref>) and possibly induced by the presence of the H 2 Ob yproduct in the latter environment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, middle). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> Since CO 2 hydrogenation is the main reaction pathway to MeOH from mixed syngas, <ref type="bibr">[4a-d]</ref> we evaluated how the different sizes of the Cu particles induced by CO 2 /H 2 and CO/ H 2 affect the activity of this reaction (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>, respectively). MeOH was formed over the catalyst pretreated in CO/H 2 in am oderately larger amount than over as ample exposed to CO 2 /H 2 (2.55 vs. 2.40 vol. %, respectively). In both tests,t he Cu particles experienced af urther growth, but they remained smaller (6.7 vs.7 .8 nm) in the sample pretreated in CO/H 2 .T hese observations are in line with the slightly higher CO 2 hydrogenation turnover frequencyo ver Cu/ZnO catalysts featuring ah igher Cu dispersion (d = 5-36 nm, determined ex situ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[12]</ref> Am inor loss in crystallinity of the Cu phase was detected in ME-SXRPD upon exchanging CO 2 by CO in H 2 or Ar (Figure <ref type="figure">S7 band c</ref>, respectively), pointing to the surface oxidation of Cu, which was also observed by Auger electron spectroscopy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 c</ref>). However,t he reversible nature of this change does not explain the different catalyst activity after the distinct pretreatments discussed above.</p><p>In addition, the mass distributions of the ZnO particles were calculated from the SXRPD patterns revealing ah exagonal prism-like morphology.T he average size (6.4 nm) did not change under the CO/H 2 atmosphere (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>,top), but largely increased (9.4 nm) upon CO 2 hydrogenation. A preferential growth of the hexagonal base diameter was determined, resulting in flatter ZnO crystallites (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>, middle). Likely due to the poor contrast between Cu and ZnO,s uch structural alterations were not visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the used materials (Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). Based on the work by Tsang et al. <ref type="bibr">[5d]</ref> on mechanically-mixed Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalysts,itwas expected that the different proportion between the base and the height of the prisms of ZnO would impact the CO 2 hydrogenation rate since the selectivity to MeOH from CO 2 /H 2 was higher over plate-like rather than rod-like particles.T hat difference was explained by an improved electronic interaction with Cu in the former case,originating from an enhanced exhibition of polar facets (e.g., (0001)). Although our selectivity patterns upon CO 2 hydrogenation after the CO 2 /H 2 and CO/H 2 pretreatments (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) agree well with Ref.</p><p>[5d],t he difference in MeOH concentration was rather low in our study (2.55 vs.2.40 vol. %). Consequently,wepropose that the concomitant RWGS reaction is more sensitive to the ZnO morphology,c orroborating the strong inhibiting effect of ZnO covering the Cu phase for this reaction <ref type="bibr">[4d,13]</ref> and the much higher concentration of CO measured after the CO/H 2 pretreatment (2.81 vs.1.97 vol. %).</p><p>In order to correlate the alterations at the particle level with the surface chemistry,w ec onducted operando ME-DRIFTS investigations upon CO 2 hydrogenation after pretreatment of the catalyst in CO 2 /H 2 and CO/H 2 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, and S10), in analogy to the SXRPD experiments.The gas feed composition was exchanged every 20 min between CO 2 /H 2 and H 2 at 373 Kand 5.0 MPa. Thelower reaction temperature was selected to prevent an excessive CO production, since intense bands of gaseous CO would mask the signals related to adsorbed CO species (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>). As described in greater detail in the Supporting Information, the spectra obtained featured signals attributed to CO adsorbed on low-index (e.g.,( 111), 2058 and 2077 cm À1 )and high-index faces of Cu 0 (e.g.,( 755), 2092 cm À1 ), as well as on Cu + sites (2129 cm À1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[9]</ref> irrespective of the pretreatment. Since the RWGS reaction predominantly occurs over the low-index Cu planes,t he Cu particle size may not have as ignificant impact on the reaction rate.Still, CO adsorbed on Cu sites next to ZnO (2058 cm À1 ) was identified in both experiments, which hints to the sensitivity of this reaction to the interaction of Cu with the ZnO particles and, in turn, the size and shape of the latter.T his evidence correlates with the enhancement of the CO 2 hydrogenation and RWGS over Cu 29 clusters on polar ZnO surfaces compared to pure Cu. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[14]</ref> Additional weak features were detected in both ME-DRIFTS experiments (Figures S10 ba nd d). Bands at 1932 and 1910 cm À1 have been associated with CO adsorbed on CuZn x alloys,w hich some studies considered as the active sites in CO 2 hydrogenation. <ref type="bibr">[5e,g,7]</ref> The changes of the ZnO and Cu reflections in the ME-SXRPD experiment (Figure <ref type="figure">S7b</ref>) could be compatible with the reversible formation of such species in line with their observation on the surface of lab-prepared Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 by in situ Auger electron spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr">[5g]</ref> However,t heir contribution to the RWGS reaction appears to be minor in view of the much stronger intensity of the infrared signals of CO adsorbed on the other Cu sites. Bands of gaseous CO were absent for the sample pretreated in CO 2 /H 2 ,evidencing its hindered desorption when plateletlike structures of ZnO are formed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>). In contrast, prominent and modulating signals of gaseous CO were detected in the measurement conducted after the CO/H 2 pretreatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>), supporting the higher RWGS activity of as ample in which Cu likely interacts more with non-polar facets of ZnO (e.g.,( 1 À100), Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>). We propose that, according to the principle of microscopic reversibility, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[15]</ref> the WGS activity relates to the particle structure similarly to the RWGS activity.T his emphasizes the importance of the derived correlations for CO 2 -promoted MeOH synthesis explaining why Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalysts with large zinc contents do not catalyze the WGS and, hence, do not feature CO 2 promotion. <ref type="bibr">[4d]</ref> In line with the catalytic data, the pretreatment does not affect the mechanism of CO 2 hydrogenation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10 a-d</ref>). In this respect, the phaseresolved analysis (Figures S10 ba nd d) uncovered two important aspects.F irstly,t he unperturbed intensity of formate bands during the modulation suggests that such species are spectators rather than reaction intermediates,i n contrast to recent kinetic models <ref type="bibr">[5e,9,16]</ref> but in agreement with studies proposing ac arboxyl (COOH*)-based route. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[17]</ref> Secondly,the detection of bands assigned to methoxy species on Cu and ZnO sites emphasizes the necessity to consider both catalyst components in future molecular studies.</p><p>In order to unravel the structure of Cu and ZnO in the promotional regime,the catalyst was exposed to mixed syngas (CO/CO 2 /H 2 )with the optimal CO 2 content (R = CO 2 /(CO + CO 2 ) = 12 %, 2.4 vol. %C O 2 ,F igure 1). Thef inal MeOH concentration in this experiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,bottom) was ca. 1.6-times larger than the sum of the MeOH concentrations expected for the amounts of CO and CO 2 in the feed, in line with the activity enhancement observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Under this condition, the Cu and ZnO particles substantially retained their original size (5.3 and 6.4 nm, respectively, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>, bottom) and relative distribution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>, bottom). It is worth noting that the H 2 Op roduced via CO 2 hydrogenation was almost fully consumed by the WGS reaction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,b ottom), which might account for the minimized sintering of Cu and ZnO.N evertheless,aslight elongation of the ZnO crystallites along the (0001) axis became evident. To shed light on the impact of the ZnO morphology on the CO 2 promotion, we applied CO/CO 2 /H 2 gas mixtures over samples pretreated in CO 2 /H 2 or CO/H 2 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>,respectively) and thus featuring different ZnO particles,asdescribed above.The extent of promotion was ca. 20 %l ower after the former treatment, in line with the hysteresis behavior shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, i.e., the promotional effect of CO 2 is still present but less pronounced when starting from aC O 2 /H 2 feed with respect to starting from aC O/H 2 feed. Ex situ characterization has excluded that this effect is associated with an irreversible deactivation of the catalyst, e.g.,continuous sintering upon the cycle. <ref type="bibr">[3b]</ref> Interestingly,the CO 2 hydrogenation rate was similar after the pretreatments in CO 2 /H 2 or CO/H 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, respectively), substantiating that this reaction is not the limiting step under the promotional regime.A dditionally,i tise vident that CO 2 promotion was suppressed to acomparable extent to the RWGS reaction in samples with platelet-like ZnO crystallites (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). Previous DFT studies on aCusurface did not indicate optimal turnover frequencies nor coverages of intermediates under mixed syngas conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[16]</ref> We therefore explain the top of the cycle (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) mainly as aresult of the depleted contacts between Cu particles and polar ZnO facets due to the elongation of the latter along the hexagonal prism axis (0001) under the optimal CO/CO 2 /H 2 mixture boosting the WGS and consequently the CO 2 promotion.</p><p>In conclusion, our study established correlations between the Cu and ZnO particle size and morphology,t he reaction mechanism, and the activity of acommercial Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst upon methanol synthesis under various gas compositions and industrial conditions.O perando SXRPD elucidated that Cu particles retained their cuboctahedral shape but sintered under CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 .T his phenomenon was associated with the segregation of Cu from ZnO upon CO hydrogenation and with the presence of H 2 Ou pon CO 2 hydrogenation. With respect to the hexagonal ZnO particles, aC O/H 2 atmosphere did not provoke significant alterations but growth and formation of platelet-like morphologies were observed under CO 2 /H 2 .S ince CO 2 hydrogenation was only slightly improved over smaller Cu particles and was insensitive to the morphology of ZnO,wededuced that this reaction cannot become al imiting step for the promotional effect. In the CO/CO 2 /H 2 mixture with the optimal CO 2 concentration, the low amount of H 2 Of ormed prevented Cu and ZnO sintering.M oreover,t he ZnO prism-like crystallites preferentially elongated along their hexagonal axis.M E-DRIFTS during reaction evidenced astrong suppression of the RWGS in catalyst samples containing platelet-like ZnO particles.The higher amount of polar facets in these structures leads to enhanced electronic interactions with Cu, which inhibit the active sites on the latter. In contrast, the preferred elongation of ZnO under the optimal gas mixture augmented the fraction of non-polar facets exposed, boosting the WGS reaction and, thus,t he MeOH formation from CO 2 .T hese findings rationalize the promotional effect and indicate that the best catalyst structure for CO 2 -promoted MeOH synthesis comprises small Cu particles in contact with rod-like ZnO crystallites, preferably stabilized by structural promoters.</p></div>
