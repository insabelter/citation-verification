<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dyslexia students frequently deal with multiple difficulties in daily life, involving social interactions throughout their lives. Sometimes they are quickly refused the chance to indulge in social events since they suffer difficulty in learning, reading, understanding, etc. AAC seems to be a vital communication aid for dyslexia students by providing an augmented reality (AR) paradigm to effective learning. This paper enhances the existing learning assistance technologies with innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to reinvigorate the Augmentative Alternative Communication (A 2 C) model for dyslexia children. The AIbased Augmentative Alternative Communication Approach has been developed to enhance learning skills with dyslexia by adapting to practices, and learning models are cognitively considered. The work on the academic skills of dyslexia students has been improved through the AI-based alternative communication paradigm for the improvement of the students with reading and learning. The AI-based AAC (AI-A 2 C) integrates the hybrid AI classifier in AAC to classify unique questions and provide users with the most appropriate pictograms. In contrast to the standard application, the proposed classifier decreased the effort and time taken to interact by 36.56% and 66.34%. Furthermore, the proposed model's performance is evaluated by its accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid AI classifier and compared with other AI classifiers.</p></div>

With the currently available technology that has significantly influenced the instructor's ability to deliver the curriculum, dyslexic students are frequently ignored when designing and delivering those resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tanwar et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, they didn't get the same learning opportunities as regular students. The currently available E-learning resources are commonly developed based on satisfying the regular students' capabilities and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shankar et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tiron &amp; Gherguţ, 2019</ref>).

However, dyslexia studies in many ways do not have specific information about transition rules, for example, how to deal with the specific error profile in the reading and learning aspects of a dyslexic student <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Prathik et al., 2018)</ref>.

Dyslexia professionals will then determine the effects of the implementation of delivering instructional guidance to dyslexia students. This assessment modifies the hypotheses of dyslexia, which are the basis for developing reading and learning assistance for dyslexia students <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Manogaran et al., 2020)</ref>.

Here, the AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication model identifies structured and non-structured data. Therefore, the latter term is used to differentiate the organized and unstructured data from data sets for dyslexia students. This model of decision-making is used to classify and increase the precision of the source data.</p><p>The remainder of this research is structured as follows. Section 2 details the relevant works. Section 3 outlines the proposed AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication (A 2 C) model. Section 4 details the hybrid AI-based classifier.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed AI-A 2 C</head><p>To improve students' learning abilities with dyslexia by adapting to the practice and teaching models that both cognitively and commitment consider, the AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication model developed. The work focuses on dyslexia students learning abilities. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the process of AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication model for enhancing the reading and learning abilities of dyslexia students is illustrated.</p><p>In certain aspects of society, dyslexic children encounter difficulty in learning and reading and low performance. However, dyslexia does not mean that these students can learn correctly; it takes longer and requires more effort than average students.</p><p>As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the proposed model consists of five primary components: the activity model, behavioural model, participant model, experts model, and trainer model. However, the discussion on the behavioural model paradigm reflecting student interaction in reading and learning abilities. The collected information is first observed, classified, and then differentiated for delivering optimized responses for the dyslexia students. The responses are known as the recommendations based on the perceived data sources. The advice is made accessible to the relevant details in the reading and learning abilities of dyslexia students. In this method, A 2 C is built to manage the network's non-structured data and ensure a consistent user recommendation.

Based on the mapping history μ′ of source data, the structured and non-structured data are identified by deploying an AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Recommendation for dyslexia students reading and learning abilities</head><p>The proposed model for AI-based AAC systems, which is based on a sound basis of the Augmentative Alternative Communication study model and practice shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. AI-based AAC is an application of cloud communications but must operationalize the vital aspects of an AAC system carefully and must concentrate on individual dynamic connectivity needs. AI-based AAC is an inheritance of the classic Shannon communication device paradigm, which includes an information source that corresponds with a recipient who generates a series of messages (e.g. a sequence of image communication signals, entered by screen touches); a transmitter that translates an input message to a digital signal for delivery, an Internet cloud channel as a means of data transfer, the receiver that is an application that rebuilds the input from a signal in a language that the receiving user can recognize, and the direction through which the message is sent. A conceptual noise source is also available that is analogous to errors in encoding, decoding, and transmitting. The following expression is utilized to evaluate the recommendation system for the proposed model The recommendation model is expressed in the above Eq. (2); in this system, the mapping history of transfer data is considered to model the recommendation model. In this work, dyslexia students learning datasets is utilized for the recommendation model that holds data mapping history, both in structured and non-structured data. The (2) The input and outcome is denoted as s p and s ′ , here, the recommendation is established to the dyslexia students in well advance. E-learning is based on the key forum for enhancing the skills and understanding of dyslexic pupils, and the internet is now a common educational tool. With new technologies, dyslexic students are underestimated when developing and delivering these tools and the willingness of a teacher to deliver the programme. They did not have the same chances for learning as normal students. The e-learning services available today are generally built around meeting the strengths and needs of everyday students.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">� c j � = s � � s p l � + � w b � e p � × � + u � �� + ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ w f -w �� j f e p ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ × n � j=1 d j � j f � + u �</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Hybrid AI classifier</head><p>The goal of the hybrid AI classifier is to decide on a rough pictogram classification (pictogram p). The forecast is based on the time pattern of several earlier classifications. It may be due to improvements in the disposition of dyslexia students learning abilities such as reading ability and writing ability or both.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>  is initially used to predict a suitable data classifier D (P) * for the rough pictogram (pictogram p), and it is adopted for hybrid AI-based fine-tuning to obtain the updated data classifier D (P) . This recommendation model is repre- sented for mapping experience of transmission data, which is considered in this scheme as a model for the model of recommendation. In this work, dyslexia students studying databases are employed for the recommendation model that holds data mapping background, both in structured and non-structured data. The result of the recommendation model is determined as the end-user input for different data.</p><p>Due to smooth class data transformations over time, the above aspect contributes to comparatively slow improvements. The realization of a major transforming feature uses the first transforming component to collect the entire temporal pattern and remove context effects. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, prior classifiers' maximum time dynamics are reported by the first principal component path. Initially, the analysis of facts on adaptation is focused on advanced theories on dyslexia. Professionals with dyslexia will then assess the impact of providing training advice to students with dyslexia. This evaluation modifies dyslexia theories to develop reading and learning support for students with dyslexia.</p><p>With the following sequence, the hybrid AI classifier prognosis is observed. First of all, the prior classification schemes are centralized in the classification parameter domain, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In the above Eq. (3), D (j) denotes the data before domain centralization and D (j) denotes the data after domain centralization of the data classifiers. A significant component transformation from classification parameter space to main component space is used to transform the domain-centered classifiers expressed in Eq.

The matrix H is evaluated by disintegrating</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">the matrix D = d (p-1) d (p-2) … d (p-m) T</formula><p>. With singular disintegrating value. The next step is to map on a time scale the maximum time dynamics of previous classifications.

Regression analysis is applied to find a classifier for pictogram p . The selected polynomial function is expressed in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) where s denoted as function order and b 0 , b 1 , … , b m denoted as coefficients of fitting function. The measuring dates used are numerical days from a standard reference date. According to the structure of the sequential trend of classification, the order of the fitting feature is targetable. Higher orders of polynomials may be implemented to obtain better match precisions, but there is also an elevated chance of overfitting. Therefore, the balance between fits precision and overfitting problems should be considered when determining the fitting function.</p><p>After identifying the coefficients of fitting function b 0 and b 1 with the previous AI classifier data, the initial principal data of the selected classifier for pictograms p , f (p) * 1 as calculated in Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Fine-tuning of hybrid AI classifier</head><p>The second stage of the proposed AI-based AAC systems consists of a domain adaptation algorithm. It boosts the classifier with training samples of the real image to a projected location (pictograms p ). Classification estimation errors are supposed to be compensated after fine-tuning.</p><p>The algorithm is built-in advance to place the accurate classifier not far from the expected location. This is a rational assumption because the classifier prediction is based on historical data from previous images, and adjustments are always incremental over time. The goal of the finish is to improve the precision of the classification of the training samples in pictograms p . The inputs of the expected clas- sifier and the training samples are thus integrated with the algorithm and are balanced, as detailed below. The predicted classifier uses previously limiting the fine-tuned classifier to abandon the predicted location too far. The distance between D (j) and D (j) is minimized.</p><p>In the above Eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), non-negative surplus terms = i n i=1 are introduced to restricts the deviation of lower specification and upper specification limits of d In above Eq.

( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)</p><p>The first concept of the objective function is the margin of the classifier. The term is intended to change the separating hyperplane to a location where the maximum range of class space is generated, like that in standard SVM. The 2nd and 3rd terms are intended to mitigate the degree of violations. The optimistic parameters D and G are normalization ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D (P) * = H -1 f (p) * 1 + 1 m (p-m) ∑ i=(p-1) D (i) (8) -i ≤ d (p) i -d (p) * i ≤ i (9) v j n ∑ i=1 d (p) i u j,k + d (p) n+1 ≥ i (10) min 1 2 n ∑ i=1 d (p) i 2 + D m ∑ j=1 j + G n ∑ i=1 i</formula><p>parameters and are used to regulate weights of second-and third-term. D and G values are respectively controlled by the inputs from experiments and previous images. It should be remembered that for the fine-tuning algorithm, the parameters G and D must be preset.

The effort and time have taken show low to the high value that deploys the number of dyslexia students datasets.

Here, the structured and non-structured data are separated that deploys better detection for the varying data. The accuracy is calculated by identifying the various data on time and finds the nonstructured data. If the path and the structured data are identified on time, the proposed work's accuracy increases. Thus, the accuracy increases for the varying survey and analyzing the pictograms, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Efficiency analysis</head><p>The proposed model's efficiency varies for the survey and analysing the pictograms performed in the AI environment, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>. If the proper communication 1 3</p><p>developed between the teacher and dyslexia students, then the efficiency of the proposed model improved, and it is represented as w b e p × + u � . The mapping history is related to the verification and the submission of previous results. The structured and non-structured data contribute to the enhancement of route and bandwidth in this assessment phase. The organized data detection deploys the recommendation by mapping the previous data. The data collection correlated with the synchronization stage is performed here. If contact is formed consistently, the synchronization is calculated. This phase concerns the decision, the equipment needed, and the synchronization figures. A mapping with processing history using the data and forwarding the response is used to render the recommendation process. The suggestion loss happens if the mapping is not performed correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Effort analysis</head><p>Figures 9 and 10 show the effort is associated with the communication established between the teacher and dyslexia students. Effort varies for the survey and analysing the pictograms; here, the selection of data points is estimated, and it is represented as u j , v j m j=1</p><p>. The recommendation is provided to the structured data. The synchronization is then reliably resolved as the recommendation is forwarded. The loss is observed in conjunction with the collection of hyperplane and data mapping. Both uniform or not based on this recommendation, data recognition is given on a timely basis. The commitment is minimized because the submission includes uniform data obtained from dyslexia students' data sets. The assessment phase is related to the data points that detect various data. Here, the response to secure contact between the teacher and students will be forwarded on time.</p><p>In this case, the monitor and bandwidth of the various data are minimized. The separating process achieves this. Data synchronization is calculated to deploy the organized data and to define fault tolerance. The data points are used to decrease the effort of the proposed model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Response time</head><p>The response time decreases for the varying survey and analyzing the pictograms between the teacher and dyslexia students, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. The time of responding is identified for the request from the devices that relates to the structured data. In this case, the margin is chosen to classify the data points, and interpretation is made by grouping.</p><p>In the case of failure of the decision, the response time for the proposed model is decreased, and it is represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">min 1 2 ∑ N i=1 � d (p) i � 2 + D ∑ M j=1 j + G ∑ n i=1 i</formula><p>This is done for the different sensor data utilized for structured and unstructured data classification. In the collection of marginal data points, connectivity between devices is created. The hyperplane determines the fault tolerance and senses the margin of this work. The collection of margins relates the data similar to the structured data. The rest of the data is known as non-structured data and is calculated on a timely basis. The recommendation is sent to the equipment demanded and correlated with data differentiation. This differentiation is used  for the study of structured and unstructured data information. The comparison results are listed in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>From the above Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the proposed model (AI-A 2 C) increases accuracy and efficiency 40.88% and 39.71% respectively and minimize the effort and response time to interact by 36.56% and 66.34% respectively.</p><p>From the above Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the proposed model (AI-A 2 C) increases accuracy and efficiency 39.39% and 38.67%, respectively and minimizes the effort and response time to interact by 43.25% and 66.77%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, the use of an AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication was explored to advance assistive learning tools that complement the needs and skills of students with dyslexia. The research types of students with dyslexia and the application of help technology concern these learning behaviours. AI-based e-learning framework may be created to match the services available with the student's instructional needs and abilities, which offers the degree of modification necessary to ensure that the e-learning programme incorporates the supporting tools needed to deliver student-specific learning experiences. The outcomes show that the work on the educational skills of dyslexia students has been enhanced through the AI-based alternative communication paradigm for the improvement of the students with reading and learning. This means that a wide spectrum of consumers and spectators can reused and employ the proposed model. The suggested model may be used for a range of reasons and applied to people suffering from general accessibility issues as the problems of dyslexia are also often faced by persons with other particular needs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Proposed AI-A 2 C Model</figDesc><graphic coords="2,84.64,433.33,426.00,258.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
