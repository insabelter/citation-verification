<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M</head><p>any biological compartments form by liquid-liquid phase separation, and the viscosity of these compartments is known to be dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref>. To investigate this phenomenon further, we tested the effect of ATP on the formation of liquid compartments formed by purified fused in sarcoma (FUS). In healthy cells, FUS forms liquid compartments that are involved in transcription, DNA repair, and RNA biogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. We reconstituted FUS compartments in vitro at physiological concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref> using low salt (70 mM) buffer conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref> and tested the effect of ATP around its physiological concentration range of 2 to 8 mM (9), complexed with Mg 2+ ions (ATP-Mg) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>. (For the chemical structures of all compounds used in this paper, see figs. S1A and S2A.) Indeed, 8 mM ATP-Mg prevented liquid-liquid phase separation and dissolved previously formed drops (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). We observed similar effects of ATP with other proteins that form liquid compartments (11) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, A and B). A fluorescent tracer molecule confirmed that ATP was enriched in the liquid drops (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). Importantly, APPNP was as efficient as ATP in preventing the formation of liquid drops (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1,  D</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Thus, at millimolar concentrations, ATP dissolved drops independently of its role as an energy source.</p><p>Changing the ionic strength of a solution can strongly influence electrostatic interactions by changing the Debye screening length. This might drive a phase separation known as the salt effect (12, 13) (see the supplementary materials for details on salt effect). However, increasing the amount of salt (KCl) to physiologically relevant concentrations (150 mM) showed a negligible effect on phase separation of FUS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>, B to D). This observation was consistent with salts of different valences, and only solutions with an ionic strength above physiologically relevant concentration were able to perturb phase separation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</p><p>We investigated whether other physiologically relevant, structurally related nucleotides could affect FUS phase separation. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) dissolved drops with a concentration similar to that of ATP (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1E</ref>). Both adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) dissolved drops, but at higher concentrations than ATP (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1F</ref>). Because the intracellular concentrations of ADP, AMP, and GTP are ~200, ~200 to 800, and ~400 mM (9, 14), respectively, they would have negligible effects in vivo on the solubilization of liquid compartments. TP-Mg had a negligible effect on FUS drop dissolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, D to F, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>), indicating that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for the dissolution of FUS drops. Taken together, our data show that the tripolyphosphate moiety combined with the adenosine confers a chemical property to ATP that is manifested at millimolar concentrations.</p><p>The hydrophilic tripolyphosphate moiety and a relatively hydrophobic adenosine ring provide ATP with an amphiphilic property. Several amphiphilic small molecules, such as sodium xylene sulfonate (NaXS) or sodium toluene sulfonate (NaTO), function as hydrotropes and are commonly used in industrial processes to solubilize hydrophobic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>. First described by Neuberg in 1916, hydrotropes are a class of amphiphilic, organic small molecules that increase the solubility of sparingly soluble organic molecules in water by several orders of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17)</ref>. Hydrotrope action seems to involve a preferential nonstoichiometric accumulation of hydrotrope molecules around the solute. In addition, their aggregation is dependent on the presence of solute molecules, and they do not adopt any well-defined superstructure on their own, unlike surfactants <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. Given the similarities between classical hydrotropes and ATP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>), we sought to explore whether ATP might act like a hydrotrope in a classical hydrotrope assay, in which the solubility of a hydrophobic compound such as fluorescein diacetate (FDA) in water is quantified as a function of hydrotrope concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. For a hydrotrope such as NaXS, as its concentration increases, FDA solubility in water increases and the latter is quantified by ultraviolet absorption at 480 nm of the aqueous medium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>, upper panel). NaXS required concentrations greater than ~1 M to effectively solubilize FDA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>). However, ATP achieved the same effect at concentrations as low as 100 mM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>, lower panel). Water-soluble assemblies comprising amphiphiles (e.g., hydrotropes and surfactants) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref>) structured around a hydrophobic molecule consist of relatively nonpolar interior microenvironment. An organic dye, ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid) is commonly used to probe the polarity near the head group (hydrophilic) or interfacial region of such amphiphilic assemblies. The fluorescence emission maximum of ANS is blue-shifted in a hydrophobic microenvironment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>, upper panel). Thus, the concentration at which the blue shift of ANS is maximal is a widely used indicator of the effectiveness of a hydrotrope <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22)</ref>. Classical hydrotropes such as NaXS and NaTO induce a blue shift in the emission spectrum of ANS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. ATP altered the emission spectrum of ANS to the same degree as NaXS and NaTO, albeit at much lower concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>, lower panel). This shows that ATP is much more efficient than classical hydrotropes for creating a solubilizing microenvironment for hydrophobic molecules that are unlike micelles (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2B</ref> and<ref type="figure">supplemen</ref>tary text). Furthermore, we found that similar to ATP, NaXS can dissolve FUS liquid drops (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). The solubilization of proteins in cells has also been attributed to osmolytes inside a cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24)</ref>. However typical osmolytes could not recapitulate the effect of ATP on FUS droplet solubilization (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, and supplementary text).</p><p>We next investigated whether high concentrations of ATP could also prevent protein aggregation. Using a centrifugation assay, we showed that millimolar concentrations of ATP kept FUS soluble and that higher concentrations of ATP prevent FUS aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3,</ref><ref type="figure">A to C</ref>). Notably, millimolar concentrations of ATP could also dissolve preformed FUS fibers, albeit at higher concentrations than were required to prevent aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>, D to F). We also showed, using incorporation of thioflavin T, that ATP prevents the aggregation of two proteins that tend to cause amyloids: (i) synthetic Aß42 peptides, which aggregate to form Amyloid beta, associated with Alzheimer's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>; and (ii) the prion domain of the yeast protein Mot3 (Mot3-PrD), which is thought to form functional aggregates in yeast cells (26) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of ATP in a more physiological mixture of biological molecules at physiological concentrations, we studied protein aggregation in chicken egg white. At high temperatures, egg proteins lose their native conformation, thus exposing hidden hydrophobic patches within the proteins, which drive the aggregation of egg-white proteins. ATP inhibited the aggregation of boiled egg white in a dosedependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, A to C; fig. <ref type="figure">S4, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>; and movie S1). Thus, ATP appears to prevent aggregation of egg white by stabilizing the native globular state (fig. <ref type="figure">S4C</ref>).</p><p>Taken together, our experiments suggest that ATP has two different chemical properties. At micromolar concentrations, it acts as an energy source to drive chemical reactions, whereas at millimolar concentrations it acts to solubilize proteins.</p><p>The action of ATP at millimolar concentrations to solubilize proteins is reminiscent of the known activity of a hydrotrope. Since their description by Neuberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>, hydrotropes have been widely employed in industry to achieve highly concentrated aqueous formulations of hydrophobic compounds. They modify viscosity and cloud point, minimize phase separation at ambient temperatures, and reduce foaming. They reduce long-range ordering of amphiphilic or hydrophobic molecules by forming a stacked, highly dynamic layer around the solute molecules to produce a continuous isotropic solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. The data showing that the hydrophobic adenosine ring of ATP strongly enhances the effect of the charged tripolyphosphate moiety on protein stability are consistent with the hypothesis that ATP also acts as a hydrotrope, where the aromatic group could form dynamic clusters around hydrophobic solute molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21)</ref>. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the action of ATP to stabilize biological molecules remains to be elucidated <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>. Recently, rigorous statistical thermodynamic theories indicate that it is the preferential nonstoichiometric binding/clustering of hydrotrope molecules around a solute that could explain molecular mechanisms behind hydrotrope action <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. ATP might be a suitable biological hydrotrope because of interactions of both its charged and hydrophobic moieties with the amino acids of proteins.</p><p>The high concentration of ATP in cells has long been a puzzle, because ATP-dependent enzymes require micromolar concentrations of ATP. Why, then, would a cell invest so much energy into maintaining its cytoplasmic ATP concentration at ~5 mM? One explanation is that the free-energy difference between ATP and ADP is required to drive ATP-dependent reactions and that the    50-fold higher ATP/ADP ratio is necessary to fuel the myriad metabolic reactions taking place simultaneously in a cell. However, cytoplasm can have protein concentrations over 100 mg/mL <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>, and it is extremely difficult to maintain such high protein concentrations in a test tube without spontaneous aggregation. The hydrotrope activity of ATP may help keep proteins soluble in the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref> and provide another, but not mutually exclusive, explanation for high ATP concentrations in cells. Possibly also, as the levels of ATP decline with age or mitochondrial impairment, this could lead to increased aggregation and consequently neurodegenerative decline during aging. Our work in this paper has focused on the role of ATP in keeping unstructured proteins soluble, because these are the types of proteins that have a propensity to form pathological aggregates <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>. It will be interesting to examine the role of high ATP concentrations in stability and function of multimolecular protein machines.</p><p>More generally, during evolution, the production of complex macromolecules would have immediately presented the problem of aggregation. As one of the basic building blocks in RNA and DNA, ATP may have been coopted early in evolution to prevent such aggregation. It is ideal for this purpose, due to the high activation energy required to hydrolyze the polyphosphate bonds in an ATP-Mg-water complex. ATP could later have been adopted to provide the basic energy source for metabolism, which is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
