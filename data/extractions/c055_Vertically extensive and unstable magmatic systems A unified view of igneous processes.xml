<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Volcanoes are an expression of their underlying magmatic systems. Over the past three decades, the classical focus on upper crustal magma chambers has expanded to consider magmatic processes throughout the crust. A trans-crustal perspective must balance slow (plate tectonic) rates of melt generation and segregation in the lower crust with new evidence for rapid melt accumulation in the upper crust prior to many volcanic eruptions. Reconciling these observations is engendering active debate about the physical state, spatial distribution and longevity of melt in the crust. Here we review evidence for trans-crustal magmatic systems and highlight physical processes that might affect the growth and stability of melt-rich layers, focusing particularly on conditions that cause them to destabilize, ascend and accumulate in voluminous but ephemeral shallow magma chambers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>For more than 100 years, a classic concept for volcanism and igneous processes has been a melt-dominated magma chamber (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) that supplies volcanoes during eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The model commonly considers the magma chamber to be long-lived, usually shallow, and to solidify eventually to form igneous plutons such as the silicic Sierra Nevada batholith and the mafic Stillwater, Skaegaard and Bushveld intrusions.</p><p>The magma chamber is reproduced in simplified forms in introductory textbooks and popular science conceptions of volcanic activity, as illustrated by the Wikipedia entry: "A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth". Key igneous phenomena that have been viewed through a magma chamber prism include geophysical investigations of magmatic systems, igneous differentiation, volcano evolution, volcanic unrest, caldera collapse and ore deposit formation. From a hazards perspective, the magma chamber paradigm remains central to many conceptual models of volcanic eruptions and, as a consequence, is a common starting point for interpreting geophysical signals of unrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Over the past few decades, however, accumulating evidence from geophysical, geochemical, petrological, volcanological and geological observations is proving enigmatic, puzzling or inconsistent with the classic magma chamber paradigm. At the same time, physical models of igneous processes based on thermal, mechanical and dynamical principles suggest that classical magma chambers are surprisingly difficult to form and to maintain. For this reason, igneous processes are increasingly viewed as occurring throughout the crust, with the magma chamber occupying only the top of a much larger trans-crustal magmatic system.</p><p>Processes in the larger system lead to magma accumulation in the shallow crust. This perspective has developed into the concept of open, rather than closed, magma chambers that can be modified by both crustal assimilation (3) and magma replenishment from greater depths <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Magma replenishment results in various mixing phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and provides one possible triggering mechanism for volcanic eruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Looking deeper, thermal models suggest that the lower crust is the most favourable location for initial stages of fractionation and melt segregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, and exposed crustal sections show a continuum from mafic cumulates in the deep crust to granitic intrusives in the upper crust <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. In this way, conceptual models of magmatic systems have evolved to encompass the entire crust (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</p><p>Another emerging consensus is that trans-crustal magmatic systems (TCMS) are dominated by crystal mush. Here we use the term mush to refer to any system of crystals and melt in which the crystals form a continuous framework through which melt is distributed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). Thus mushes are by definition at or above the solidus and are synonymous with partially molten rock. Mushes in their entirety are not eruptible <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> because their rheology is controlled by deformation of the crystalline framework.</p><p>For this reason, the deformation behaviour of mushes is sensitive to the absolute melt fraction. This is particularly true below about 0.07, which defines the melt connectivity transition, below which the strength of the crystal-melt aggregate increases strongly with decreasing melt fraction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> inset; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>). Mush fragments, however, can be erupted as crystal clots (glomerocrysts), cumulate nodules or restite (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Eruptible magma, in contrast, is defined as a suspension of crystals in melt (+/-exsolved volatiles). The transition from magma to mush takes place over a narrow range in crystal content <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, where the bulk viscosity increases by several orders of magnitude and the crystal-melt suspension develops strongly non-Newtonian properties (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). Typically the rheological transition occurs within the window of 50-65%, but may occur over a narrower range for a specific system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</p><p>A mush-dominated view of igneous systems has great explanatory power, but requires new conceptual models for addressing questions related to both magma evolution and the behaviour of volcanic systems. In particular, it shows that TCMS models need to address both the chemistry and physics of multiphase (crystal-melt-volatile) materials.</p><p>Although such systems are quite easy to conceptualise, they are remarkably difficult to model numerically, not only because of the number of phases, but also because those phases react with each as the system evolves: melts crystallise, crystals dissolve and gases exsolve. We describe components of such a model to illustrate that, by connecting processes throughout the entire TCMS, it should be possible to (1) relate physical processes of crystal-melt-fluid segregation to magmatic differentiation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> anticipate interactions between melts and fluids generated and stored at different depths, and (3) determine the physical mechanisms by which magma and associated fluids move through the crust, accumulate in shallow chambers, and then erupt. These processes represent internal controls on volcanic eruptions. Although external controls (e.g., tectonic, isostatic, hydrothermal interactions) also influence melt accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>, here the focus is on internal processes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STORAGE REGIONS</head><p>The concept that magmatic systems extend beneath upper crustal magma reservoirs is not new; in fact, the geochemical case for magma accumulation and processing in the deep crust was made elegantly almost thirty years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. More recent thermal and physical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> suggest extensive igneous differentiation in the deeper and hotter parts of the crust. Melt storage in the lower crust may partially explain a persistent puzzle in studies of magmatic systems, which is the inability of geophysical imaging techniques to identify large volumes of melt in the subsurface, even in regions that are currently active or have produced very large eruptions in the Quaternary. These volcanic systems are commonly underlain, however, by electrically conductive zones of low seismic velocity that are certainly hotter than the surrounding crust, and probably contain melt. At Yellowstone caldera, USA, for example, tomographic studies have identified a large (~ 10,000 km 3 ) low velocity body at 5-17 km depth, which is underlain by an even larger (46,000 km 3 ) lower crustal anomaly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</p><p>With estimated melt contents of 9% and 2%, respectively, the upper and lower mush zones may each contain hundreds of km 3 of melt, more than enough to generate another super-eruption. Even more extensive is the Altiplano Puna Magma Body in the central Andes, where recent geophysical surveys have identified a low velocity zone in the mid-crust (&lt;25 km depth) that may comprise up to 500,000 km 3 of meltrich (≤25%) mush <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>.</p><p>The geometry of melt distribution in lower and mid-crustal reservoirs is not well constrained. Melt fraction estimates based on tomography or MT images are averaged at resolutions that are typically no better than about 1 km, so melt-rich regions smaller than this scale cannot be detected. However, a plausible notion, consistent with a large body of physical theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, is that melt is heterogeneously distributed in the lower crust and includes (microscale) melt distributed along grain boundaries, mesoscale variations in melt concentration created by compaction, and large-scale, vertically stacked melt-rich lenses. The latter have been inferred from a recent tomographic study of the very large Toba caldera, Indonesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and observed in regions of extension, such as mid-ocean ridges <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, Iceland <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and continental rifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>The inability of geophysical methods to identify large melt-rich bodies in the upper crust, in contrast, suggests that large volumes of upper crustal melt are likely ephemeral. In extensional environments such as mid-ocean ridges, identified melt lenses are thin and sill-like in shape. In arc environments, large regions of possible melt accumulation appear limited to the mid-crust, where they may feed multiple volcanoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. Between the mid-crust and individual volcanoes, observed low velocity zones are typically narrow and vertically elongated, averaged melt estimates are &lt;10%, and exsolved volatiles may be important at shallow levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p><p>Conditions of magma storage can also be inferred from the compositions and textures of the erupted material (lava and pyroclasts). Phase compositions and proportions can be matched to pre-eruptive magma storage conditions using phase equilibria experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, and bulk magma compositions are commonly used to track magma evolution by crystal fractionation and/or assimilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. Growing evidence for extensive entrainment of crystals throughout the spatial extent of the magmatic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>, however, suggests that these methods do not provide sufficient information to fully characterize most magmatic systems. The diversity of crystal 'cargo' contained within many volcanic rocks is nicely illustrated by the most common igneous mineral plagioclase, where the crystallization history is preserved in strikingly complex compositional zoning patterns that appear as shades of gray in the backscattered electron image shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>. Measured compositional and trace element variations in a single crystal can then be modeled using data from an experimentally determined phase diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) to show that, in this example, the crystal core resided in a cooler but deeper part of the magmatic system before being entrained by hotter melt that transported it to a shallow temporary storage region and, ultimately, to the Earth's surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. More generally, abundant evidence for diverse pre-eruptive histories of neighbouring crystals within individual samples requires crystals to be assembled from different parts of the subvolcanic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, often shortly before eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. These crystals may derive from either cooler marginal zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref> or deeper and hotter parts of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref>. The complex history of the crystal cargo is further illustrated by variations in isotopic compositions within and between individual crystals <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>. These data show that different crystals in a sample, or even different zones within a crystal, must have grown from isotopically distinct melts. It is hard to envisage such small-scale isotopic heterogeneity existing within a large and continuous body of melt.</p><p>Further insight into the nature of magmatic storage systems can be found in measured timescales of magmatic differentiation, crystal growth and (pre-eruptive) residence time in the transporting melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. Timescales of magma differentiation can be estimated by dating zircon crystals, which are sufficiently resilient to be recycled between individual magma batches. Zircon data suggest differentiation timescales of 10 3 to &gt;10 5 years, which contrast sharply with the much shorter timescales (&lt; 1 to ~10 3 yrs) calculated for magma accumulation in the upper crust prior to volcanic eruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>. This dichotomy is illustrated by the example from Mount St. Helens shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Here isotopic constraints show that entrained plagioclase crystals grew over thousands of years (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>; (68)), while zircon crystals derive from magmatic activity tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the 1980 eruption (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>). Diffusion time scales for magma assembly prior to the 1980 eruption, in contrast, are on the order of months to years <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>, which are commensurate with the months of observed pre-eruptive unrest. These timescales can be reconciled only if crystals with different histories, stored in different parts of the magmatic system, are transported to the growing upper crustal magma chamber and amalgamated shortly prior to eruption.</p><p>The depth range of pre-eruptive magma storage can be estimated using the dissolved volatile content of crystal-hosted melt inclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72)</ref>. Crystal-hosted melt inclusions from extensional environments show shallow magma storage over a limited pressure range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>); this is true for both a young submarine basalt flow from the Galapagos ridge (GAL) and a large silicic eruption in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand (OR). In contrast, melt inclusions from arc volcanoes commonly record a larger pressure range, as illustrated by data from Etna volcano, Italy (ETNA) and Popocatepetl volcano, Mexico (POPO), Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat (SHV) and Mount St. Helens, USA (MSH). Additional pressure estimates obtained from geobarometry of deep-crystallizing pyroxenes (SHV) and amphiboles <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref> suggest that many magmatic systems extend at least to the mid-crust. Additional evidence for magmatic systems that extend from the upper to mid-crust comes from seismic data collated from eruptions over the past few decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75)</ref>, which cover a similar depth range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>).</p><p>Measurements of dissolved volatiles provide only a minimum estimate of magma storage pressure. First, melt inclusions record only the part of the magmatic history over which crystals are growing and trapping inclusions. Second, not all volatiles are dissolved in the melt prior to eruption. CO 2 , for example, is relatively insoluble in silicate melts and will start to exsolve at high pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>. Additionally, sulphur dioxide, which is much more soluble, also shows emissions accompanying explosive volcanic eruptions that greatly exceed the volume of gas that could have been dissolved in the erupted magma <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>. One plausible explanation for this excess gas is the presence of an exsolved volatile phase in the magma chamber. This explanation does not work, however, when excess gas is emitted over long time periods, and/or is not correlated with extrusive activity. For example, the 1995-2010 eruption of Soufrière Hills volcano, Montserrat, was accompanied by elevated gas emissions over the entire eruptive episode despite long hiatuses in eruptive activity. These observations require the volatile phase to be decoupled from the magma; they also appear to require segregation and accumulation of exsolved fluids at depth during the long period (centuries) of dormancy that preceded the onset of eruptive activity in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, geophysical, geochemical and petrologic observations combine to present a picture of magmatic systems that extend through the crust, are largely crystalline, and are characterized by distributions of melt, crystals and exsolved volatiles that are heterogeneous in both space and time. This conceptual model of TCMS raises new questions about the development and stability of these complex systems and the processes that control their chemical and physical evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF MELTS AND MUSHES</head><p>Most crustal magmatism is driven, ultimately, by the influx of mantle-derived basaltic melt. Rates of magma generation are governed by plate tectonics and mantle convection, and modulated by melt segregation and transport within the mantle. These rates are assumed to be slow, and intrusion into the lower crust incremental.</p><p>Volcanism is, in stark contrast, episodic, often involving large magma volumes erupted over very short times <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79)</ref>. This dichotomy suggests that a balance between slow magma accumulation and rapid magma release is inherent to magmatic systems, and that the physical processes that control chemical evolution of magma also control the episodicity of volcanism. Thus a key question relates to threshold behaviours that control the physical transitions from slow melt accumulation to rapid melt transfer.</p><p>These transitions are most likely modulated by processes that control the distributions of melts, crystals, and volatiles within the crust.</p><p>Primitive basaltic melts are supplied incrementally to the crust from the mantle. Their initial fate is determined by thermal constraints, and by temperature-dependent physical processes. If individual magma additions are sufficiently small that they thermally equilibrate with their surroundings at the level of emplacement (80), the ambient temperature will impart one of three possible outcomes: (1) complete solidification, (2) formation of (non-eruptible) mush or (3) formation of (eruptible) magma.</p><p>In the lower crust, high ambient temperatures approach the solidus and are thermally favoured to keep primitive basalt additions above the solidus; for this reason, the flux required for magma accumulation is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. It is also an environment where dense basalts stall, cool and crystallize to form both melt-rich mushes and evolved melts.</p><p>Here the mushy state is easily achieved and melt-bearing regions may be sufficiently long-lived to allow extensive melt segregation and fractionation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Segregation occurs by mush compaction, which squeezes out evolved melts with compositions that reflect the input melt composition (particularly the volatile content) and the temperature contrast between the melt and the ambient environment. The segregated melt evolves by cooling-driven crystallization, which is typically much faster than compaction. The derivative melts can then ascend to higher levels in the crust, leaving behind refractory cumulate rocks.</p><p>At shallower levels in the crust, temperatures can be maintained above the solidus between melt inputs only when intrusion rates are sufficiently high or intrusion volumes are sufficiently large <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. In these circumstances, melt-bearing mush can persist for long periods of time and chambers of eruptible magma can grow <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. The rate of cooling depends on both melt volume and geometry. Large melt intrusions can cool rapidly if they pond and convect, mix with cooler (stored) melts, assimilate partially molten wall rocks, or are associated with major hydrothermal systems in overlying crust. Small intrusions may be too thin to convect, but lose heat rapidly by conduction. Cooling rates are thus minimized when the temperature contrast between melt and host is small, or when the crystal content is sufficiently high to prevent convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(81)</ref>. In the upper crust, individual magma batches moving from hotter to cooler regions achieve local thermal equilibrium in &lt;10 3 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Large igneous systems (spatial scales of 10 to 100 km), however, may have lifetimes of 10 5 to 10 7 years. Accommodating large volumes of eruptible magma in the middle and upper crust over these time spans requires a sustained and localised magma flux at rates that are substantially (one to two orders of magnitude) higher than average <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83)</ref>.</p><p>Thermal requirements for maintaining non-eruptible crystal mushes in the upper crust are less severe. Here the temperature threshold is the solidus rather than the temperature at which the system is ~50% molten. This means that mushes can exist at temperatures a few hundred degrees lower than eruptible magmas, particularly when they have high water contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83)</ref>. By definition, melt-rich crystal mushes will have a yield strength that inhibits initiation of convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84)</ref>, and a sufficiently high viscosity that convection, even if started (e.g., by heating and crystal resorption), will be sluggish <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(81)</ref>. Thus cooling will occur predominantly by conduction, and on the basis of heat transfer alone we infer that upper crustal mush systems are characteristically long-lived. Whether the mush is maintained at melt contents close to that required for eruptibility (~40%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86)</ref>) or approaches the solidus (87), will depend on magma composition, input rates, local stress fields and heat transfer to the surroundings.</p><p>Thermal conditions, however, provide only one constraint on mush evolution. An additional consideration is the changing spatial distribution of melt and crystals, including melt segregation by compaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88)</ref> or shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(89)</ref>. At low melt fractions, the time and length scales of compaction are strongly controlled by the melt viscosity and matrix properties (permeability, bulk and shear viscosity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>).</p><p>Compaction time scales can vary from thousands of years (for basaltic melts) to hundreds of thousands of years (for wet silicic melts); corresponding compaction length scales vary from hundreds of meters (basalt) to only a few meters (wet rhyolites). Broadly this explains why many crustal ultramafic and mafic plutonic rocks are refractory adcumulates from which melt has been largely extracted <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>; granitoid compositions, in contrast, suggest less efficient melt-crystal separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref> notwithstanding long cooling times. Compaction-driven melt segregation and evolution can also explain both the overall density and compositional stratification of the crust <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and, in a general sense, why long-lived mush systems are favoured at higher levels in the crust, where the bulk and melt compositions are more evolved and compaction time scales are long.</p><p>Melt segregation processes are well described in shallow mafic bodies. Relatively thin (&lt;200 m) mafic lava flows, lava lakes and shallow sills, for example, experience rapid cooling; here the extent of compaction-driven melt segregation is modest, generally ceasing at crystallinities of 30-50% (50-70% melt; <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(92)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(93)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(95)</ref>). These melt retention values overlap with melt estimates for basal (rapidly cooled) sections of large mafic intrusions, such as the Skaergaard ((96-99); Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>). Higher in these intrusions, textures are adcumulate and melt segregation is efficient, with trapped liquids representing only 1-5% of the resulting rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>. In these systems, melt segregation efficiency can be modeled as a balance between rates of crystal settling, melt convection through the mush, compaction and cooling, and changes in the crystallizing mode (which controls the density difference ∆ρ between melt and matrix; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>). Convection through the mush is controlled by melt viscosity and matrix permeability, in turn a function of melt fraction and mean crystal size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>).</p><p>The strong size dependence of permeability is interesting and demonstrates that the permeability reduction expected because of reduced porosity accompanying crystal growth is countered, at least in part, by increasing crystal size.</p><p>The efficiency of melt segregation in upper crustal silicic magma bodies is less well constrained, and lies at the center of a controversy concerning links between plutonic and volcanic rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101)</ref>. Under favorable circumstances (hydrous silicic melts with matrix and melt viscosities of 10 15 -10 17 and 10 4 -10 5 Pa s, respectively;</p><p>(102)), models suggest that compaction-driven melt segregation could occur over geologically reasonable time scales (10 4 -10 5 years). Efficient melt extraction in these systems, however, requires either maintenance of upper crustal mush zones at high temperatures (high magma influx rates) and/or sufficiently low melt viscosities (high dissolved volatile contents; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103)</ref>).</p><p>The models of melt compaction and segregation reviewed above consider only the physical behaviour of the melt and matrix. Chemical interactions will also be important if the melt and crystals in the mush are not in equilibrium. Segregating melts that travel through porous networks in a temperature gradient may heat and melt matrix crystals, which, in turn, can focus melt into high permeability channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105)</ref>. When upward moving melt is reactive chemically as well as thermally, progressive reactions also change the composition of the both the percolating melt and the matrix crystals <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">107)</ref>. Although reactive models have long been applied to grain boundary flow of melts in mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108)</ref> and crustal metamorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110)</ref>, there are very few studies of reactive flow within mush-dominated magmatic systems. Exceptions include descriptions of reactive melt infiltration in mafic sills <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(111)</ref> and intrusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113)</ref>. Here melt is driven towards the cooler margins by crystallization-driven volume reduction and resulting pressure gradients.</p><p>Lateral melt infiltration causes incompatible element concentrations to increase in the marginal facies <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(111)</ref>. Similarly, observations of unusually high concentrations of incompatible elements in the lower oceanic crust have been used as evidence of reactive flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(114)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(115)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(116)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(117)</ref>. Evidence for reactive flow may also be cryptic, as illustrated by the inferred reaction of melt and clinopyroxene to form amphibole in the source regions of arc magmas (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(118)</ref>).</p><p>Pervasive reaction during flow requires melt to percolate along grain boundaries. Melt geometries in high crystallinity mush zones have not been extensively studied, except in cumulate nodules brought to the surface with volcanic rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119)</ref>. These nodules commonly preserve melt along crystal boundaries and in the triple junctions between crystals, suggesting that processes related to reactive flow are likely to exert strong controls on the temporal, spatial, thermal and compositional evolution of mushy magmatic systems. Importantly, percolative, reactive flow through mush piles can cause geochemical variations that are not captured by arithmetical descriptions of fractional or equilibrium crystallisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(120)</ref>. As a consequence, the tools commonly used to interpret geochemical variations in igneous rocks may be ill-suited to understanding the processes that created them.</p><p>Volatiles also migrate through active magmatic systems, as demonstrated by high volatile fluxes measured in arc volcanoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>. Physically, dissolved volatiles contribute to melt buoyancy and enhance upward magma ascent. The chemistry of the exsolved volatile phase varies with the depth of exsolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>. Volatiles with low solubilities will exsolve first; in the case of carbon dioxide this may occur in the lowermost crust or mantle if initial CO 2 contents are sufficiently high <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>. Volatile exsolution further increases magma buoyancy, unless the low-density volatile phase segregates and decouples from the crystal-melt suspension <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>. In three phase (meltcrystal-fluid) systems, the geometry of the exsolved volatile phase is controlled largely by the crystal fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122)</ref>. In particular, as the crystal concentration approaches the packing limit (~ 50-65%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), concentration of the volatile phase into narrow channels may greatly enhance segregation efficiency. Pervasive upward migration of exsolved volatiles, in contrast, may disrupt loosely bound crystal networks and has been postulated to trigger very large eruptions of crystal-rich intermediate-composition magmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(123)</ref>. At high crystal contents (&gt;~60%), the lowdensity volatile phase forces melt through the locked crystal network in a process known as filter pressing <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124)</ref>. At very high crystallinities (very low melt permeabilities), gas-generated overpressures can fracture and brecciate the solidifying mush <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(125)</ref>. Thus the efficacy and style of volatile extraction from magma reservoirs may change significantly as they cool and crystallise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">MAGMATIC PROCESSES FROM A MUSH PERSPECTIVE</head><p>The review presented above shows that controlling processes in crystal-rich mushes are different from those in melt-dominated magma chambers. Mushes are multiphase systems in which buoyant melt (and sometimes fluids) are distributed within a deformable crystalline matrix; the dynamics of such systems are characterised by compaction-driven segregation of melts and fluids from the crystalline matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105)</ref>. Melt-rich segregations, in turn, are inherently unstable and can amalgamate to form larger magma accumulations. These magma chambers are susceptible to processes of convection, cooling and crystallization that are commonly considered to control magma evolution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(81)</ref>). Thus a mush perspective both extends the way in which we think about igneous and volcanic processes, and presents challenges for future work. Key mush processes are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. In the lower crust, the high mean temperatures and low melt viscosities combine to promote highly efficient compaction-driven melt segregation and, in thick cumulate piles, reactive flow.</p><p>Evolved melts segregated from lower crustal intrusions will be enriched in volatiles and incompatible elements and will migrate upwards. Whether they reach the surface directly or stall and accumulate at intermediate levels will depend on the thermal state of the melt and intruded crust, as well as its thickness, rheology and state of stress.</p><p>Ascending melts in arc environments commonly accumulate in the mid-crust <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126)</ref>, perhaps because of an abrupt increase in rigidity, and/or a decrease in density, at the brittle-ductile transition. At this level, open system processes in both the melt and mush will modulate the compositional evolution and stability of the resulting magma.</p><p>Destabilization of melt lenses is probably common, and may be responsible for episodic and rapid ascent of evolved melts to upper crustal reservoirs. During this process, mass balance may be achieved by convective return of dense refractory cumulates to the lower crust through negative diapirism <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128)</ref>. In this way, the dual processes of (1) ascent of evolved melts and (2) sinking of refractory cumulates can explain not only the abrupt mid-crustal change in composition and density observed in crustal arc sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, but also growing evidence for mid-crustal magma intrusion and storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129)</ref>.</p><p>Episodic 'recharge' of upper crustal magma chambers is widely recognized as necessary to grow large magma bodies, and is commonly invoked as a trigger for volcanic eruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. In a trans-crustal model, this recharge magma derives from melt accumulations deeper in the system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>), and commonly brings with it volatiles, crystals (antecrysts), crystal clots (glomerocrysts) and cumulate nodules derived from the (more crystalline) mush (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Although recharge magma may be preserved as enclaves with distinct compositional and textural features, the ubiquity of antecrysts and glomerocrysts in many erupted magmas attests to efficient mixing of successive recharge batches during the magma accumulation process. This mixing may be aided by volatile exsolution during both magma ascent (71) and enclave cooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(130)</ref>. When ascending separately from the melt, the volatile phase may travel along grain boundaries to cause either reactive melting (if it increases P H2O ) or reactive crystallisation (if it decreases P H2O ; Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), or may be released en masse to interact with higher levels of the magmatic system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>); loss of those volatiles to the surface by passive degassing has been suggested as an eruption trigger <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(131)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, volatiles may segregate and become trapped as a separate layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>, or may feed a hydrothermal brine cap in ways that are critical for ore formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133)</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). It is possible that rapid release of magmatic volatiles may also trigger phreatic eruptions from hydrothermal systems.</p><p>Physical decoupling of the crystal, melt and volatile phases will also affect their chemical signatures. In this way, different processes are recorded by the non-eruptible mush, the mobile melt, and the magma (which may combine both mobile and nonmobile elements). Segregation of melt from crystal mush explains extensive geochemical evidence for fractionation as a major process in the evolution of igneous rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, as well as general characteristics of arc crusts <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(134)</ref>. At the same time, reactive flow associated with melt/volatile segregation means that the bulk compositions of magmas and gases are the integrated result of processes that have acted over space and time. As a result, trace elements affected by reactive flow may be difficult to reconcile with bulk crystallization models <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135)</ref>. Bulk analyses of crystal separates from a single sample, or even analyses of individual crystals, may similarly integrate a wide range of spatio-temporal information, such that a single rock sample can preserve a rich record of the magmatic history. Interrogation of these records driven by rapid advances in microanalytical tools have provided much of the evidence for subvolcanic mush zones; future interrogation of the highly variable crystal cargo transported in many erupted magmas (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>,3) will help to assemble a comprehensive picture of the evolution of individual magmatic systems in space and time.</p><p>A mush perspective also provides new insight into mechanisms by which eruptible magma bodies form. A widely applied conceptual model of magma chamber formation involves melt inputs into an upper crustal magma chamber at a rate that is sufficiently fast to grow a single large magma body (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). This incremental model of melt accumulation generally assumes that aliquots of melt are emplaced into subsolidus country rock. The universal applicability of incrementally grown magma chambers is being challenged, however, by evidence that many igneous processes occur over timescales of decades to millennia, much faster than incremental growth models suggest. Are there other ways to grow magma chambers that can account for this paradox? One alternative mechanism is to rapidly redistribute melt from vertically stacked lenses within a mush into a single magma chamber <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136)</ref>.</p><p>Rapid destabilisation explains not only the dichotomy of slow melt segregation followed by rapid magma assembly, but also addresses the space problem, which is that the country rock must be either displaced or assimilated to make room for the growing magma chamber. Destabilization of a vertically extensive crystal mush-melt system, however, involves rearrangement of crystal and melt layers; because the melt and crystal phases are incompressible, this can occur without substantial volume changes except when accompanied by upward transfer of volatile-saturated melts. At the same time, mush destabilization explains the occurrence of crystals with very different histories in a single sample of erupted rock (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</p><p>Finally, a mush model has important implications for understanding volcanic eruptions. First, it offers a way to merge, conceptually, slow (plate rate) processes of melt generation with rapid eruption of large magma volumes. This slow-fast dichotomy is nicely described by Hildreth and Lanphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(137)</ref> in their description of dormancy as "an anthropocentric notion and generally only an upper-crustal condition; suspensions of eruptive activity… need signify no fundamental change in deep-level magmatic processes." It also offers a cautionary note for efforts to anticipate future large eruptions. On the one hand, if distributed melt lenses can destabilize rapidly to accumulate in the shallow crust, or are tapped syn-eruptively to produce large cumulative erupted volumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(138)</ref>, then it may be difficult to recognize systems poised to generate a large eruption. On the other hand, the association of very large eruptions with crystal-rich (≥35% crystals) magma suggests that these eruptions are triggered when a near-eruptible mush (~60% crystals) is mobilized by inputs of either volatiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(123)</ref> or melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(139)</ref>. This model raises an important question that relates to the standard state of the mush: near-solidus or near-eruptible? Thermal and rheological constraints suggest that compaction and melt segregation in the lower crust should efficiently segregate melt and crystals; as a result, we expect that the lower crust comprises near-solidus mush with interspersed melt lenses. These same constraints suggest that it should be easier to maintain near-eruptible mush in the upper crust, where melts are more evolved and the system is cooler. Whether maintaining large volumes of near-eruptible magma also requires unusually high magma inputs is an active topic of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">140)</ref>. Answers to these questions will require integration of geophysical, geochemical and petrological studies of active volcanic systems. Blue curve is calculated assuming a maximum packing fraction of 0.6 and a classical Roscoe-Einstein formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Red curve uses the formulation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Inset shows changes in mush strength as function of particle volume fraction; green dashed curve is experimental data using Westerly granite, purple dashed curve is experimental data using Delegate aplite. Redrafted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.    promote efficient compaction and segregation of dense mafic cumulates from more evolved melts. Destabilization of ponded magma in the mid-crust is the likely source of 'recharge' magma that supplies upper crustal magma chambers; the process of destabilization may create and entrain cumulates, glomerocrysts and antecrysts, while magma decompression will cause volatile exsolution. Volatiles introduced to the shallow magma chamber may accumulate at the chamber roof, segregate to form an isolated volatile layer, or feed into an overlying hydrothermal system.
