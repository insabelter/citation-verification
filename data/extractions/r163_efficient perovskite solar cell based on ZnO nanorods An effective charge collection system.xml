<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ INTRODUCTION</head><p>Perovskite solar cells based on organolead halide light harvester have recently attracted much attention because of superb photovoltaic performance and very inexpensive technology. The first attempt of using CH 3 NH 3 PbX 3 (X = Br or I) as light harvester was made in dye-sensitized liquid-type solar cells, which resulted in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.1-3.8%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> PCE was significantly improved to 6.5% by optimizing the concentration of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 coating solution, perovskite annealing temperature, and electrolyte composition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> However, the perovskite light harvester suffers from liquid-type dye-sensitized solar cell because it tends to easily dissolve in the polar liquid electrolyte. This problem has been solved by replacing the liquid electrolyte with solid hole conductor. Allsolid-state solar cell comprising CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 nanodots deposited on TiO 2 surface demonstrated a PCE of 9.7%, along with excellent long-term stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> It was also confirmed that the perovskite solar cell could work well even without a mesoporous TiO 2 film, where a thin, continuous CH 3 NH 3 PbI 2 Cl layer formed on the Al 2 O 3 surface showed a PCE of 10.9%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Recent progress pushed PCE of perovskite solar cell up to 15%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Thanks to the high open-circuit voltage V oc of perovskite solar cell exceeding 1 V, a PCE of 20% is predicted from perovskite solar cell, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> which indicates that organometal halide perovskite is a very promising solar cell material.</p><p>There are two branches in developing perovskite solar cell; one is based on electron-injecting nanostructured oxide layer, and the other is based on nonelectron-injecting scaffold layer (meso-superstructure) or pn junction type planar structure. For the case of the electron-injecting oxide system, except for the TiO 2 nanoparticles, one-dimensional TiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and ZnO 12,13 were investigated. Although electron transport in ZnO was observed to be faster than that in TiO 2 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> photovoltaic performances of ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells were inferior to those of TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cells. This might be due to nonoptimized ZnO nanorods.</p><p>Here, we report high-efficiency ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells. Diameter and length of the solution-grown ZnO nanorods are controlled by varying the solution concentration and immersion time. PCE of 11.13% is achieved using 1 μm long ZnO nanorods (diameter of about 80 nm) in the absence of a compact TiO 2 blocking layer. The photovoltaic performance, especially external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectral response is compared between ZnO nanorods and TiO 2 nanorods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION</head><p>ZnO nanorods were grown based on the methods described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Laser-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω/sq) was cleaned with ethyl alcohol, water, and acetone several times. The cleaned FTO glass samples were further treated with UVO for 15 min to get rid of organic materials. The ZnO seed layer was first prepared as follows. A 5 mM ethanol solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 •2H 2 O, Aldrich, 98%) was spincoated on the cleaned FTO glass at a spinning rate of 2000 rpm for 20 s with a 10 s wait time, which was followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. This was repeated 3 times, and finally the ZnO seed layer was annealed at 350 °C for 15 min. The solution for growing ZnO nanorods was prepared by dissolving equimolar zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO 3 ) 2 •6H 2 O, Aldrich, 98%) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, Aldrich, 99%) in deionized (DI) water. The solution concentration was varied from 20 to 35 mM for controlling the diameter of the ZnO nanorods. The ZnO seed layer deposited FTO glass was immersed in the solution, where the FTO side was placed facedown, and the beaker was kept at 90 °C for 90, 120, 150, and 180 min. Change in the immersion time at a given concentration can control the length of the ZnO nanorods. The ZnO nanorod film was rinsed with DI water and ethyl alcohol several times. Finally, the film was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. For comparison, rutile TiO 2 nanorods were prepared according to the method reported elsewhere. 9 TiO 2 nanorods were grown on a dense TiO 2 layer coated FTO glass. The dense TiO 2 layer was prepared according to the method described in a previous report. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In brief, 20 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid and 20 mL of DI water were mixed and stirred for 5 min, to which 0.7 mL of titanium(IV) n-butoxide (99%, Aldrich) was added; the mixture was then stirred for 10 min. The acidic titanium alkoxide solution was poured into a Teflon liner in which the compact TiO 2 coated FTO glass was immersed, where the FTO side was placed facedown. A 100 mL capacity autoclave was kept in a preheated oven at 170 °C for 210 min. After being cooled, the TiO 2 nanorod film was rinsed with DI water and ethyl alcohol several times and then annealed at 550 °C for 1 h.</p><p>CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 was deposited in the ZnO nanorod or the TiO 2 nanorod film using a two-step method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> A 1 M PbI 2 solution was prepared by dissolving 2.33 g of PbI 2 in 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The solution was kept at 70 °C for 2 h. A CH 3 NH 3 I solution was prepared by dissolving 0.05 g of CH 3 NH 3 I in 5 mL of 2-propanol (0.063 M), where CH 3 NH 3 I was prepared by reacting CH 3 NH 2 with aqueous HI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> A 100 μL portion of the PbI 2 solution was dropped on the ZnO or TiO 2 nanorod-coated 2.5 × 2.5 cm 2 FTO substrate; the substrate was spun immediately at 3000 rpm for 20 s and dried at 100 °C for 10 min. After the substrate cooled, 200 μL of CH 3 NH 3 I solution was dropped on the substrate; a wait time of 20 s was observed, and then the sample was spun at 2000 rpm for 20 s and dried at 100 °C for 10 min. The hole transporting layer was formed by spin-coating the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-pdimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeO-TAD) solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s, where 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD was mixed with 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile), and those mixture were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally ca. 60 nm of Au was deposited using a thermal evaporator at a deposition rate of 1.5 Å/s.</p><p>Photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW/cm 2 ) illumination by using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was adjusted by a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter. During the measurments, the cell was covered with a mask having an aperture. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE system (PV Measurements Inc.). The source light for generating the monochromatic beam was a 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan). EQE data acquisition was carried out at DC mode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Time-limited current response was recorded at 10 Hz under 530 and 700 nm monochromatic beams. Time constants for charge recombination was measured with a weak laser pulse at 532 nm superimposed on a relatively large bias illumination at 680 nm using a transient photocurrent-voltage measurement setup described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Transient photocurrent or photovoltage measurement was performed with a small light perturbation, where probe light was incident over the steady-state charge induced by a bias light. The intensity of the probe light was varied by a neutral density filter corresponding to that of bias light that generates steady-state charge. The light intensity of the probe laser was much less than that of the bias light. Probe light of 0.38, 0.3, 0.147, and 0.045 nW was incident over the bias light of 14.99, 9.99, 2.59, 0.207 mW, respectively. Therefore, the collected charge induced by the probe laser was maintained below 0.1% of the steady-state charge. Although the absorption of the wavelength of the probe laser, 535 nm, is much more favored than that of the 680 nm of the bias light, the 0.1% value is still reliable for avoiding other effects. The incident charge by probe light rapidly decreased, showing first-order exponential decay. The time constant t was obtained by fitting to the measured data using the relation y = y 0 + Aexp(-x/t). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Philips PW 1050 diffractometer under graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). Surface and cross-sectional morphologies were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Diameter d of ZnO nanorod is controlled by changing the precursor concentration. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that average d increases from 54 to 61, 73, and 82 nm as the precursor concentration increases from 20 to 25, 30, and 35 mM, respectively, where the immersion time is fixed at 180 min at 90 °C. Length of the grown ZnO nanorods is about 1 μm regardless of concentration, which indicates that change in the precursor concentration at the fixed immersion time can affect only the diameter of the hexagonal ZnO nanorods. The rate of increase in diameter of the ZnO nanorods is estimated to be approximately 2.4 nm/mM. Length of ZnO nanorods can also be varied when the immersion time changes at the fixed concentration. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that average length of the ZnO nanorods increases from 440 nm to 620 nm, 820 nm, and 1 μm as the immersion time t increases from 90 to 120, 150, and 180 min, respectively, at the precursor concentration of 35 mM. Length l of ZnO nanorods grows by the relation l = 6.27t -126, which indicates that growth rate is 6.27 nm/min and a warming-up time of about 20 min is required.</p><p>The X-ray diffraction pattern in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the highly oriented nature of ZnO nanorods. The strongest (002) peak reflects that c-axis elongated nanorods are oriented normal to the FTO substrate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> compared to the prominent (101) peak for the polycrystalline powder ZnO. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Perovskite solar cells were prepared using the ZnO nanorods approximately 82 nm wide and 1 μm long that were grown at 90 °C for 180 min from the 35 mM precursor solution. The fabrication procedure of perovskite solar cell based on the ZnO nanorod electrode is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is formed by intercalation reaction of CH 3 NH 3 I in the layered PbI 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> PbI 2 is formed first in the ZnO nanorod film by a spincoating method, which is followed by spin-coating the CH 3 NH 3 I solution. A concentration of the CH 3 NH 3 I solution (∼0.063 M) lower than that of the PbI 2 solution (∼1 M) is used in order to form the perovskite phase immediately. By differentiating spin-coating conditions between CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 , a pure perovskite phase can be obtained as confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern showing no PbI 2 peaks after spincoating of CH 3 NH 3 I (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Finally, thermal evaporation of Au follows spiro-MeOTAD deposition.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows cross-sectional and surface SEM images of the bare ZnO nanorods, CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -deposited ZnO nanorods, and the full cell. In the bare ZnO nanorod electrode in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>, the compact ZnO seed layer is seen to some extent between the ZnO nanorods and FTO. This ZnO seed layer is expected to play a role in protecting direct contact between FTO and spiro-MeOTAD. Our two-step spin-coating technology leads to formation of an overlayer (capping layer) of the     CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite on the ZnO nanorod film as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>. Voids are partly found in the ZnO nanorod film, indicative of incomplete pore filling with the perovskite. The capping layer looks fibrous. From the cross section of the full cell in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref> it is noted that spiro-MeOTAD can be found in part in the ZnO nanorods, which implies that the pores in the ZnO nanorod film are not fully filled with the perovskite.</p><p>Photovoltaic performance is investigated and displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. The ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cell demonstrates short-circuit current density J sc of 20.08 mA/ cm 2 , open-circuit voltage V oc of 991 mV, fill factor (FF) of 0.56 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.13% at AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW/cm 2 ) illumination, which is by far the highest efficiency for the ZnO nanorod-based dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cell. ZnO nanorods were applied for perovskite solar cells; however, they demonstrated relatively low PCEs of 5% 13 and 8.9%. 12 EQE spectral shape is close to full-conversion as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>. EQE already reaches over 77% at wavelengths as short as 400 nm, maximizes its value at 85% at 530 nm, and retains 80% up to 700 nm. Even at a long wavelength of 760 nm, EQE is as high as 70%. The integrated J sc calculated from the EQE data is 20.03 mA/cm 2 , which agrees well with the measured J sc . The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and the absorbed photon-to-current conversation efficiency (APCE) are estimated based on LHE = (1 -R)(1 -10 -A ) and APCE = EQE/LHE, where A and R represent absorbance and reflectance, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The spectral shape of LHE in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref> is consistent with that of two-step deposited perovskite on mesoporous TiO 2 film, 5 but perovskite on the ZnO nanorod shows higher LHE (80% at 750 nm vs 60% at 750 nm in ref 5). This indicates that the present ZnO nanorod system is beneficial for utilizing long wavelength light, which is also confirmed by APCE in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7d</ref>.</p><p>In previous reports, 9,13 photovoltaic performance was better for the shorter ZnO or TiO 2 nanorod, where perovskite was prepared by one-step spin-coating. By using a one-step coating method, pores of oxide film would not be fully filled with perovskite and as a result spiro-MeOTAD should be infiltrated into the pores. Increase in the spiro-MeOTAD layer was therefore accompanied by an increase in ZnO or TiO 2 nanorod length, which can deteriorate photovoltaic performance because of the limiting of hole diffusion in the increased spiro-MeOTAD layer. In contrast to the one-step coating method, the two-step coating procedure in this study results in porefilling of perovskite, which can control the layer thickness of spiro-MeOTAD for optimal hole diffusion length. In addition, increase in nanorod length improves the absorbance of perovskite (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8c</ref>) owing to the increased overall thickness of the perovskite layer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8d-f</ref>). The highest photovoltaic performance is therefore observed from 1000 nm long ZnO nanorods among the studied lengths from 600 to 1000 nm. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref>,b confirms that photocurrent and EQE increase with increasing ZnO nanorod length because of the increased absorbance as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8c</ref>.</p><p>We compare the photovoltaic performance of the ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cell and the rutile TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cell. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows J-V curve, EQE and APCE spectra of TiO 2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell along with LHE of perovskite coated TiO 2 nanorod film, and cross-sectional SEM images of bare TiO 2 nanorods and full cell. Length of the solution-grown TiO 2 nanorods is about 1 μm, and their width is 80-90 nm, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9e</ref>. TiO 2 compact layer is clearly seen between TiO 2 nanorods and FTO. A thin spiro-MeOTAD HTM layer is formed over the TiO 2 nanorod film (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9f</ref>). Two-step spin coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in the 1 μm long TiO 2 nanorod film results in J sc of 20.92 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 869 mV, FF of 0.55, and PCE of 10.02%, which is higher than the previous result for the similar TiO 2 length 9 because of the different coating procedure for the perovskite as mentioned previously. Compared to the ZnO  nanorod, the slightly lower PCE is due to lower V oc , associated with lower conduction band position for the rutile TiO 2 structure and/or enhanced recombination. It is also noted that absolute EQE is lower in spite of high J sc , and as a result, the integrated J sc of about 16 mA/cm 2 is far lower than the measured J sc at 1 sun illumination. In addition, APCE in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9d</ref> is lower than that of ZnO (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7d</ref>) in spite of similar LHE in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9c</ref>. Because APCE can be described as the division of the EQE into its optical and electrical parts, difference in APCE at similar LHE underlines a difference in the electrical part. Thus, compared to high APCE in the ZnO device, relatively lower APCE in the TiO 2 device suggests that charge collection limits the current for the TiO 2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell.</p><p>Recombination behavior is investigated using the photovoltage decay at open circuit. The time constant for recombination τ R for the ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cell shows it to be almost 1 order of magnitude slower than that for the TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). A V oc observed for the ZnO nanorod system that is slightly higher than that for the TiO 2 nanorod system is thus related to slower recombination characteristics. It is expected that recombination  behavior seems to be similar between ZnO and TiO 2 when no electron injection occurs. Thus, photoexcited electrons in the perovskite are likely to be injected to ZnO nanorod as evidenced by the difference in τ R values.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> compares time-limited photocurrent response under a monochromatic beam. The photocurrent signal for the ZnO nanorod system is fully detected under 530 and 700 nm, whereas the signal detection is not completed for the TiO 2 nanorod system because the absolute signal amplitude for the TiO 2 nanorod system is merely 15-20% of that for the ZnO nanorod system despite similar photocurrent density observed for both systems. In addition, there are two pathways in collecting photoelectrons for the TiO 2 nanorod system: a fast and a very slow pathway. The very slow kinetics for collecting electrons is likely to limit full detection in the TiO 2 nanorod system, compared to the fast electron collection occurring through the very fast single pathway in the ZnO nanorod system. We found that a slight increase in photocurrent at slower scan in the J-V measurement was observed for the TiO 2 device (data are not shown), which also confirms that the charge collection limits the current for the TiO 2 device at faster times. Therefore, ZnO nanorod is an effective charge collection system in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 based perovskite solar cell.</p></div>

Diameter and length of the hexagonal ZnO nanorods were manipulated by controlling concentration of the precursor solution and immersion time. Two-step spin-coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I solutions led to void-filling with CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite in ZnO nanorod film. The ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cell showed almost ideal EQE spectral shape with excellent matching of the calculated J sc with the measured J sc . Compared to a limited detection in charge collection due to slow charge collection rate and low APCE for the TiO 2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell, the ZnO nanorod system showed fast saturation in charge collection, which indicates that ZnO nanorods are an effective charge collection system in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 based perovskite solar cells.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
