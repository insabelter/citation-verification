<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Previous breakthroughs in stretchable electronics stem from strain engineering and nanocomposite approaches. Routes toward intrinsically stretchable molecular materials remain scarce but, if successful, will enable simpler fabrication processes, such as direct printing and coating, mechanically robust devices, and more intimate contact with objects. We report a highly stretchable conducting polymer, realized with a range of enhancers that serve a dual function: (i) they change morphology and (ii) they act as conductivity-enhancing dopants in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The polymer films exhibit conductivities comparable to the best reported values for PEDOT:PSS, with over 3100 S/cm under 0% strain and over 4100 S/cm under 100% strainamong the highest for reported stretchable conductors. It is highly durable under cyclic loading, with the conductivity maintained at 3600 S/cm even after 1000 cycles to 100% strain. The conductivity remained above 100 S/cm under 600% strain, with a fracture strain of 800%, which is superior to even the best silver nanowire-or carbon nanotubebased stretchable conductor films. The combination of excellent electrical and mechanical properties allowed it to serve as interconnects for field-effect transistor arrays with a device density that is five times higher than typical lithographically patterned wavy interconnects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent advancements in stretchable electronics have blurred the interfaces between human and machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Devices such as epidermal electronics, implantable sensors, and hemispherical eye cameras all rely on the intimate contact between devices and curvilinear surfaces of various biological systems while operating with stability under up to 100% strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The most successful concept leading to such devices builds on linking rigid islands of active components [that is, transistors, lightemitting diodes (LEDs), or photovoltaics] with stretchable interconnects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>. Hence, developing conductors that can retain good electrical performance under high mechanical strain is paramount.</p><p>Stretchable conductors have been fabricated via two main routes: strain engineering and nanocomposites <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>. In the first approach, nonstretchable inorganic materials, such as metals, are geometrically patterned into wavy lines that can be extended when the underneath elastomer substrate is stretched <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Alternatively, depositing a thin layer of conducting materials such as metals, carbon nanotubes, or graphene on a prestrained substrate leads to the formation of periodic buckles upon the release of the strain, which allows the material to accommodate further cycles of stretching up to the initial prestrained value <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. A kirigami design or microcracks have also been applied to sheets of flexible materials to enable macroscopic stretching motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. These methods demonstrate the possibility of transforming virtually any rigid materials into stretchable materials while maintaining their electrical properties. However, the fabrication methods involved are usually complicated, and it is challenging to achieve high device density owing to the large geometric patterns required for high stretchability. In addition, the buckling and kirigami methods lead to out-of-plane patterns, which could be difficult to encapsulate and disadvantageous for devices that require planar interfaces or lower profiles.</p><p>Embedding a conductive filler in an insulating elastomeric matrix to form a nanocomposite is the second major route toward stretchable conductors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Typically, one-dimensional materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and silver nanowires are chosen as the conductive fillers because of their high aspect ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Metal nanoparticles or flakes have also been shown to be good filler materials under specific conditions because of their ability to self-organize upon stretching <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. Despite the versatility and large number of material choices, the percolationdependent conductivity is highly strain-sensitive and remains a hurdle for device miniaturization and cycling stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>To achieve a highly stretchable and highly conductive material that is readily solution-processable and patternable, an intrinsically stretchable conductor is desirable. Conducting polymers are good candidates because of the flexibility in tuning the molecular structures and electrical and mechanical properties. Their solution processability offers additional advantages for large-scale production of flexible electronics. Unfortunately, high conductivity and high stretchability have not been achieved simultaneously for conducting polymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>In general, to achieve high conductivity, high crystallinity and low insulating content are required. However, to render a polymer film stretchable, a high degree of disorder with chain folding is advantageous to create a large free volume for polymer chain movement and unfolding when being stretched <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. Poly <ref type="bibr">(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)</ref>:poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has the highest reported conductivity among solutionprocessed polymers but has a fracture strain of as low as ~5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Previous efforts enabled the stretching of PEDOT:PSS by incorporating plasticizers such as Zonyl or Triton <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. However, the enhanced stretchability often results in much lower conductivities, and the value further decreases with the application of strain. As yet, the best reported value is 550 S/cm under 0% strain and a conductivity of 13 S/cm under a fracture strain of 188% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Hence, these materials have generally been used as pressure or strain sensors where a large change in electrical signal upon strain is desirable, but they fail to serve as interconnects.</p><p>Interconnects for various rigid electrical components in circuits require an intrinsically stretchable conducting polymer with conductivity &gt;1000 S/cm at &gt;100% strain and minimal temperature dependence.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a method for creating highly stretchable and conductive PEDOT films with high cycling stability by incorporating ionic additives-assisted stretchability and electrical conductivity (STEC) enhancers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The resulting PEDOT:PSS films are both highly conductive and stretchable (higher than 4100 S/cm under 100% strain), giving rise to transistor arrays up to five times higher in island-to-interconnect ratio as compared to those using wavy metal interconnects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of STEC enhancers</head><p>We rationalized that high stretchability requires polymer films with both hard and soft domains, typically seen with hydrogenated styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) block copolymers or polyurethane elastomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Unfortunately, both PEDOT and PSS are semicrystalline polymers with no observable glass transition temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Therefore, the STEC enhancers need to partially soften polymer chains to create soft domains in order to achieve high fracture strain. To promote high conductivity, it is important to have good connectivity between PEDOT-rich domains, which requires a weakened electrostatic interaction between PEDOT and PSS to allow PEDOT to partially aggregate to form a "hard" conductive network inside a soft PSS matrix (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Previous studies reported various additives used to promote some of the effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. However, either solely improved conductivity or solely improved stretchability was reported. Here, we introduce a new approach, in which STEC enhancers soften the PSS domains and promote better connectivity and higher crystallinity in PEDOT regions while further enhancing electrical conductivity through doping.</p><p>We identified a number of effective STEC enhancers, including ionic compounds such as dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, and ionic liquids (table <ref type="table">S1</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). All these molecules have sulfonate or sulfonimide anions, which are effective dopants for conducting polymers, including PEDOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. We focus our study on the ionic liquids because of the large number of commercially available varieties. These compounds not only effectively reduce Young's moduli of PEDOT:PSS bulk film by as much as 50 times and render it highly extensible, but also preserve or increase the conductivity (table S1 and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</p><p>We found that a synergistic effect on both conductivity and stretchability can be achieved when the STEC enhancers satisfy the following two characteristics: (i) good solubility in water and the PEDOT:PSS matrix and (ii) highly acidic anions that can act as effective dopants for PEDOT. Through the evaluation of electrical and mechanical properties of freestanding PEDOT/STEC films, we found that STEC enhancers 1 to 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) lead to both high conductivity and good stretchability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>, and sections S1 and S2). Even with as high as 40 to 50 weight % (wt %) incorporation of STEC enhancers, the rheological characteristics of the bulk films are similar to those of viscoelastic solids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref> and sections S1 and S2). Therefore, we chose these systems for further investigations.</p><p>Highly conductive and stretchable PEDOT film supported on elastic substrates Stretchable PEDOT is characterized using thin films directly coated onto SEBS elastic substrates to evaluate their electrical behavior as transparent, thin-film electronic components. When stretched, an initial increase in conductivity by almost three times to up to 3390 S/cm under 100% strain was observed along the stretching direction (s || ), but it de-creased in the perpendicular direction (s ⊥ ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). A high degree of PEDOT chain alignment was confirmed by polarized ultravioletvisible (UV-vis) measurement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). The dichroic ratios (A || /A ⊥ ) calculated using the absorption of the 785-nm peak and the free-carrier tail at 1100 nm both showed a monotonic increase from 1 under 0% strain to ~3.2 under 125% strain, which is indicative of chain alignment along the parallel direction to stretching (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). This agrees with the increase in conductivity along this direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</p><p>Followed by the initial increase at lower strains, s || then decreased consistently under &gt;100% strain until the substrate ruptured. We obtained the best performance for films with STEC enhancer 1, where the conductivity remained above 1000 S/cm between 0 and 100% strain, with the highest value at 3390 S/cm under 100% strain, above 100 S/cm up to 600% strain, and a final conductivity of 56 S/cm even when stretched to a record 800% strain, beyond which point the substrate ruptured. Optical microscope images of the stretchable PEDOT films held under strain show that cracks do not form until ~150% (section S5). Even under strains as high as 550% with a much higher crack density, the films have morphologies of an interconnected network, which could account for the reasonably high conductivity under high strain. Compared to most reported stretchable conductors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), our material not only has a higher initial conductivity and a slower drop in conductivity under tensile strain but also sustains the highest maximum tensile strain. Note that, although a maximum 100% strain is necessary for wearable or epidermal electronics, a higher stretchability is required when these materials are used as interconnects for rigidisland device arrays shown later. In addition, the ability for a material to be elongated to several times its original length greatly broadens its applications to robotics and biomechanical systems under extreme conditions.</p><p>The stretchable PEDOT films show high cycling stability. The film conductance G (reflects change in resistance) retained 92% of the original value under 50% strain after 1000 cycles and 71% when the cycling strain was 100% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). The conductivity (s || ) of these films increased with strain as a result of the chain alignment phenomenon. After 1000 cycles, the films still exhibited a 2.1-and 2.8-fold increase in conductivity under 50 and 100% strains, respectively, as compared to the unstrained films (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Note that the conductivity ex-hibited an increase during approximately the first 100 cycles but then stabilized at a more constant value. At the end of 1000 cycles to 100% strain, no visible cracks formed on films when inspected under an optical microscope (section S4) and an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). The darker lines visible in optical microscope images were revealed to be deep folds by AFM analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>), demonstrating the excellent durability of the PEDOT/STEC films under repeated strain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stretchable PEDOT film morphological characterizations</head><p>We found that the STEC enhancers (such as 1 to 3) play a number of roles in PEDOT:PSS in terms of charge transfer doping, crystallinity, and morphology. First, it has been documented that small ionic species can have a charge screening effect that weakens the Coulombic interactions between the polyelectrolytes PEDOT and PSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. The charge screening effect was previously found to result in higher crystallinity of the PEDOT-rich domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>. We observed larger colloidal particle sizes in solution with the addition of STEC by dynamic light scattering analysis (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). In addition, more distinct nanofibrous structures were seen in dried films by AFM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, H to K, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). In thin films, we observed that C a ═C b vibration peaks (~1445 cm -1 ) in Raman spectroscopy red-shifted and were narrower ). For the standard PEDOT film without any STEC additives, three peaks were observed along q z : q z = 0.57 Å -1 (d = 11.2 Å), 1.33 Å -1 (d = 4.9 Å), and 1.87 Å -1 (d = 3.4 Å), which can be indexed as PEDOT (200), PSS amorphous scattering, and PEDOT (010), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45)</ref>. (H to K) AFM phase images of regular PEDOT:PSS (H) compared to PEDOT with high stretchability by incorporating STEC1 (I), STEC2 (J), and STEC3 (K).</p><p>in width in the PEDOT/STEC films compared to the pure PEDOT:PSS control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). This indicates that a higher proportion of the benzoid moieties in PEDOT are converted to the quinoid structure from oxidative charge transfer doping, which results in a more planar backbone <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. This planarity may contribute to more efficient charge delocalization and a higher packing order <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. The charge delocalization effect is further confirmed by UV-vis-near-infrared (NIR) spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> because the ~800-nm peak became less well defined and a more intense free-carrier tail extending into the NIR was observed when STEC1, STEC2, and STEC3 were incorporated into PEDOT:PSS.</p><p>Grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns indicate that the ordering in the semicrystalline PEDOT:PSS films was improved with the addition of STEC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, C to G, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). Specifically, the (200) d-spacing increases with increased STEC contents in the films, which is accompanied by a slight decrease in d-spacing for the (010) peak (from 3.4 to 3.3 Å) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Meanwhile, with the addition of STEC, a new peak emerges at q z = ~0.89 Å -1 (d = ~6.8 Å), which was previously reported and assigned to PEDOT, but no definitive indexing was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>. In addition, we observed this peak in the PEDOT:PF 6 system without PSS (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), further confirming that it arises from PEDOT scattering.</p><p>Combining the above evidences, we propose a schematic representation of the composition and morphology of the PEDOT/STEC films (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>): The charge screening effect of the ionic STEC additives results in a morphological change to form more crystalline and more interconnected PEDOT nanofibrillar structures. Because the PEDOT phase becomes more crystalline with the addition of STEC, we suspect that it is likely that the STEC molecules mostly reside in the more disordered regions, which further softens the material. This gives rise to a nanofiber network embedded in a soft matrix, which is a desirable morphology for high stretchability. Such morphology is also advantageous for high conductivity because of the higher crystallinity of the PEDOT domains and the improved connectivity.</p><p>Films with the highest conductivity values were obtained with the above morphological improvement and an additional STEC washing of the films (Materials and Methods and figs. S15 to 17). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) sputtering experiments indicate that the surface of the as-spun PEDOT/STEC film has a higher PSS + STECto-PEDOT ratio than the interior of the film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S17</ref>). Rinsing with an STEC aqueous solution after annealing removes the excess PSS from the film surface, leading to a thinner film with a higher PEDOT content, thus further improving the conductivity (figs. S16 and S17). Treating the films with water led to a similar effect in terms of conductivity enhancement, but STEC solutions are used here to minimize the loss of STEC plasticizers that are necessary for stretchability. The conductivity for PEDOT/STEC systems increased rapidly as the STEC concentration increased until ~45 wt % (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref> and figs. S15 to 17). It then remained nearly constant upon further addition. The highest conductivity values achieved were 2588, 3102, and 2544 S/cm at 71 wt % of STEC1, STEC2, and STEC3, respectively, versus 4 S/cm without these additives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temperature dependence of conductivity</head><p>The chemical composition and morphology of materials have direct impact on the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, which provides insights into transport properties. Aiming at applications where highly stretchable materials are used as interconnects between different electronic components, possible temperature drifts have to be minimized. The temperature dependence of PEDOT thin films between 340 and 75 K were measured in a cryostat using a four-probe dc current method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). All samples exhibited reversible temperature dependence with low hysteresis, indicating high stability. An empirical relation has been used to extract the temperature resistance coefficients of first and second order (section S6). PEDOT with dimethyl sulfoxide as the additive exhibited a very high linear temperature resistance coefficient of about a = 0.35%/K, whereas PEDOT/STEC enhancers 1 and 2 showed much lower values of 3.8 × 10 -7 and 7.6 × 10 -3 %/K, respectively.</p><p>A widely used model to describe the temperature behavior of disordered polymeric systems assumes that the charge transport is dominated by interchain hopping probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. The temperature dependence of these materials follows a non-Arrhenius quadratic expression originating from a Gaussian disorder and has been reported to describe systems with low charge carrier densities well. On the other hand, at high charge carrier densities, a universal Arrhenius-like temperature dependence has been observed for disordered conjugated polymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. Our stretchable PEDOT/STEC materials exhibited a clear temperature-activated behavior following the Arrhenius law (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). The activation energy extracted for PEDOT/STEC1 and PEDOT/STEC2 was found to be only about 3 and 4.1 meV, respectively. These values are much lower compared to typical PEDOT films, which have an activation energy of 15.2 meV. These results agree with the stronger free-carrier tails observed in UV-vis-NIR spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), which suggest that STEC enhancers also act as "secondary" dopants for PEDOT. The doping effect increases the charge carrier density and shifts the Fermi level E f above the equilibrium level E q , which is represented by the maximum of the density of occupied states <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. The lowest activation energy of PEDOT/STEC1 remains in agreement with the highest room temperature conductivity and the lowest linear temperature resistance coefficient of 3.8 × 10 -7 %/K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applications and patterning of stretchable PEDOT</head><p>Because the conductivity of the stretchable PEDOT remains well above 1000 S/cm even under 100% strain, only a thin layer is needed to achieve low resistance, rendering it a good transparent stretchable conductor. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref> depicts the relationship between film transmittance and sheet resistance. A sheet resistance of 59 ohms/sq was obtained for a film with 96% transmittance (with substrate absorbance subtracted). This is among the highest values reported for PEDOT transparent electrodes, whereas none of the previously reported highly conductive ones were stretchable <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>. The resistance decreased as the film thickness is increased, and it reached ~10 ohms/sq with a 75% film transmittance at 550 nm. The film with 96% transmittance has a figure of merit (FoM) of 142, which surpasses the previous highest value from spin-casted PEDOT films and transparent CNT electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>.</p><p>Larger patterns (that is, &gt;500 mm) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>) can be readily obtained by screen printing or etching through a shadow mask and are stretchable when printed on an elastic substrate such as SEBS. Complex patterns with resolution down to 40 mm can be obtained through inkjet printing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, G to I).</p><p>To demonstrate the application of stretchable PEDOT as interconnects, we used it to connect rigid LEDs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Negligible change in LED light intensity was observed even under high strain conditions, such as twisting while stretching or poking the interconnect with a sharp object (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, and videos S1 and S2), due to the small change in resistance upon tensile strain.</p><p>One distinct advantage of an intrinsically stretchable conductor as interconnects for rigid-island matrices is that it can lead to a much higher surface filling ratio (f) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> for active devices (islands) compared to the wavy interconnects, where a large amount of space between the rigid islands needs to be reserved for the wavy metal ribbons <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. To dem-onstrate the potential of PEDOT/STEC as interconnects in high-density circuits, we connected multiple rigid islands with field-effect transistor (FET) devices by lines of PEDOT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>, F to H).</head><p>A rigid island-to-interconnect width of 1:1 (f = 50%) is typically required for wavy interconnects to reach stable performances under 100% strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. The actual length of the stretched interconnect is much longer than the spacing between rigid islands (for example, up to &gt;12 times if straightened) (6). In our case, for unidirectional stretching, a rigid island-to-interconnect ratio of as high as 5:1 (f = 78%) can still lead to identical transistor current and threshold voltage characteristics from 0 to 150% strain for the linear array (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S29</ref>), which inflicts &gt;530% strain on the PEDOT region based on finite element simulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</p><p>To demonstrate the feasibility of multidimensional stretching, we fabricated 3 × 3 arrays with f of 78% and uniformly stretched them in all directions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S30</ref> and table <ref type="table">S2</ref> show the transfer curves for the nine transistors under 0 and 125% strains for overall device structure. The mobility variation for all the transistors is within ±10% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5I</ref>). This strain is well beyond the 100% strain requirement for wearable and epidermal electronics, illustrating the excellent stretchability and the stable electrical performances of the PEDOT interconnects under strain. This array is especially suitable for stable performance on curved objects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5H</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S31,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">video S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>We have demonstrated a highly stretchable and conductive PEDOT polymer by incorporating ionic additive-assisted STEC enhancers that result in a morphology that is beneficial for both high stretchability and conductivity. A further boost in conductivity is achieved through a proper selection of anions. The resulting materials show record-high stretchability and conductivity, the coexistence of which is rare for conducting polymers. High-density FET arrays connected using the stretchable PEDOT films show stable performance under &gt;100% strain. This material synergistically combines high electrical conductivity, exceptional mechanical ductility, and patternability by printing, thus opening many new avenues toward next-generation wearable and epidermal electronics and bioelectronics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material preparation</head><p>PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) was obtained from Clevios, and the STEC ionic additives were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. SEBS with 20% styrene content (Tuftec H1052) was supplied by AK Elastomer. HiPco single-walled CNT (SWCNT) was sorted via a previously reported method (43) using poly(3-dodecylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3DDT) to obtain semiconducting SWCNT for transistor fabrication.</p><p>In a typical experiment, STEC of 10 to 71 wt % was added to the PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion (1.1 to 1.3 wt %) and stirred vigorously for 15 min. Thick films were acquired by drying the mixture overnight in a Teflon mold and then annealing at 130°C for 15 min. Thin films were processed onto glass, SiO 2 /Si, or SEBS substrates by spin coating at 1000 rpm for 1 min under ambient conditions, followed by a 10-min annealing at 130°C. A postdeposition washing step was then carried out by dropping an aqueous solution containing 10 mg/ml of the corresponding STEC on the PEDOT films, waiting for 1 min, and removing the liquid by spinning the samples at 3000 rpm for 1 min. Glass or SiO 2 /Si was treated with oxygen plasma at 150 W for 30 s, and SEBS was treated with UV ozone for 30 min or with oxygen plasma for 10 s (150 W) before PEDOT deposition via spin coating (1000 rpm for 1 min, followed by annealing at 70°C for 30 min). The SEBS substrates were prepared from a toluene solution (200 mg/ml) casted onto a glass slide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrical property</head><p>Conductivity measurements were carried out using a four-point geometry. Electrodes were deposited by applying silver paste or EGaIn or by evaporating gold. A minimum of three to five measurements were obtained for an average value. Low temperature-dependent measurements were performed in a LakeShore cryostat under 10 -5 mbar vacuum. A bottom gold contact geometry was used to ensure stable electrical contacts under thermal cycling. A slow cooling and heating rate of about 1.4 K/min assured the stabilization at each temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed ion-electron conductivity</head><p>Mixed ion-electron conductivity was studied using impedance measurements. The PEDOT films with STEC enhancers were cut into round tablets (diameter, 3.5 mm; thickness, ca. 100 mm). Two glassy carbon electrodes (diameter, 3 mm) were used to sandwich the tablet to form an electrical contact for the impedance measurement. The impedance data as functions of frequency were acquired by a Bio-Logic VSP-300 workstation with a sine wave signal amplitude of 10 mV. Resistances from the ionic versus electronic components were calculated using previously reported procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanical property</head><p>Mechanical properties of freestanding films around 200 mm in thickness were studied using Instron 5565 with a 100-N loading cell using dumbbell film geometry. The storage, loss moduli, and stress relaxation tests were carried out on a dynamic mechanical analysis (TA Instruments Q800).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphological and chemical characterization</head><p>Microscopy was performed on a FEI XL30 Sirion scanning electron microscope. AFM images were recorded in tapping mode using a Veeco Multimode AFM. UV-vis-NIR spectra were collected on an Agilent Cary 6000i model. Dynamic light scattering experiments were carried out using 100-fold diluted PEDOT/STEC dispersions on a Brookhaven Instrument 90. XPS was performed on a PHI VersaProbe Scanning XPS Microprobe. Sputtering was carried out at 10 kV and 20 mA with a C 60 ion sputtering gun to preserve the chemical information in the polymer films. Film thickness values were measured using a contact probe Dektak 150 profilometer and averaged from a minimum of three areas.</p><p>Grazing-incidence x-ray scattering GIWAXS measurements were carried out at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at beamline 11-3, with a photon energy of 12.735 KeV and a sample-to-detector distance of 320 mm. The incident angle was fixed at 0.14°to probe the entire film with reduced substrate scattering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patterning</head><p>Patterned films [feature size, &gt;500 mm (such as for the LED or FET arrays)] were obtained by repeating the spin coating and washing steps three times for PEDOT on SEBS, followed by oxygen plasma etching (150 W for 5 to 10 min) through a shadow mask until the exposed PEDOT films were completely removed.</p><p>Micrometer-sized patterns of the stretchable PEDOT/STEC were achieved through inkjet printing using a fourfold diluted dispersion. The dispersion was passed through a glass fiber syringe filter with a pore size of 0.7 mm and degassed for a few minutes to remove trapped air bubbles before it was loaded into a cartridge. A Dimatix Fujifilm DMP 2800 inkjet printer with 10-pl drop volume cartridges was used to print this ink on different substrates, such as SiO 2 /Si, SEBS, or photo paper. The optimal printing parameters for plasma-treated SEBS substrate (150 W for 10 s) were as follows: drop-to-drop spacing of 30 mm; a jet speed and a frequency of 5 m/s and 1.5 kHz, respectively; a cartridge temperature of 28°C, and a substrate temperature of 30°C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stretchable rigid-island transistor arrays</head><p>Transistors on rigid Si islands in our arrays were fabricated by first patterning the Cr/Au (5/40 nm) source and drain electrodes through a shadow mask on a SiO 2 /n ++ -Si wafer (Si and SiO 2 serve as the back gate and dielectric layer, respectively). Each FET device has a channel width of 1000 mm and a channel length of 200 mm. The sorted SWCNT dispersion (0.7 ml) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref> was spin-coated on the patterned substrates (2 in × 2 in) at 2000 rpm for 90 s. The sample was then soaked in toluene at 90°C for 30 min to remove the P3DDT, dried with nitrogen flow, and annealed at 120°C for 20 min under ambient conditions. Polydimethylsiloxane shadow masks were aligned on the devices to protect the active device areas. The SWCNTs between devices were then etched away by oxygen plasma (150 W for 10 min). Single rigid-island devices were obtained by dividing the whole piece into 5-cm × 5-cm chips along the CNTfree spaces. The 3 × 3 stretchable organic transistor active matrices were fabricated by immobilizing the individual islands using silver epoxy onto a SEBS substrate and linked together using patterned PEDOT/STEC1, creating a common back gate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>). Under ambient conditions, the transistor performance was characterized using a Keithley 4200 SC semiconductor analyzer under different strains for each rigid island while applying common gate voltages through the PEDOT interconnects.</p></div>
