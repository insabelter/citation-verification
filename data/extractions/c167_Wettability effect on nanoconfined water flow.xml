<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Understanding and controlling the flow of water confined in nanopores has tremendous implications in theoretical studies and industrial applications. Here, we propose a simple model for the confined water flow based on the concept of effective slip, which is a linear sum of true slip, depending on a contact angle, and apparent slip, caused by a spatial variation of the confined water viscosity as a function of wettability as well as the nanopore dimension. Results from this model show that the flow capacity of confined water is 10 -1 ∼10 7 times that calculated by the no-slip Hagen-Poiseuille equation for nanopores with various contact angles and dimensions, in agreement with the majority of 53 different study cases from the literature. This work further sheds light on a controversy over an increase or decrease in flow capacity from molecular dynamics simulations and experiments. T he flow behavior of water confined in nanopores is crucial for understanding and resolving many common challenging problems in science and engineering, such as nanomedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, water purification <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and energy storage and conversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, as well as geophysical processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>.

Moreover, these physical phenomena are further augmented by a high ratio of nanopore walls to a confined water volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Some novel and different flow phenomena have been discovered, helping in theoretical investigations of the dynamics of the confined water. The flow rates, measured by Majumder et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and Holt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> for water flow through membranes of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with diameters of 1.3-7.0 nm, are two to five orders of magnitude greater than those calculated by the no-slip Hagen-Poiseuille equation. However, the flow rate of water through 44-nm carbon nanopipes, measured by Whitby et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, is only an order of magnitude greater. Furthermore, a decrease in the flow rate can occur for water confined in some nanopores, which has been discovered by many investigators <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr">(32)</ref>.

However, important emerging new physical phenomena must be taken into account in the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>, including different boundary conditions (slip, no-slip, and multilayer sticking) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and apparent viscosity caused by an interaction between water and nanopore walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.

We establish a relationship between a true slip length and wettability as well as the links between an apparent slip length, wettability, and a nanopore dimension. The flow rates calculated by this model are in accord with the majority of those from the literature for water confined in nanopores, with a total of 53 cases. This model can be used to quantitatively explain a controversy in MD simulations and experiments over an increase or decrease in the flow capacity of confined water. This study provides a simple and effective tool for modeling flow of water confined in nanopores with a diameter of larger than 1.6 nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Mechanisms of Water Flow Through Nanopores. Many issues related to mechanisms of water flow in nanopores are still unresolved, even including the most basic one: How does the water slip actually happen? <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no satisfactory answer can be given at present. We summarize the basic physics underlying these issues and make full use of all experimental evidence collected in the literature to reveal the most accredited mechanisms of water flow through nanopores.</p><p>The confined water possesses unique structural and dynamical properties, significantly different from those of bulk water <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. It is now clear that water confined in nanopores can exhibit a dramatic change in viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, and the no-slip boundary condition is not always universal <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. This is because the viscosity and slip of the confined water strongly depend on a relative strength of two interactions, namely, a ratio of the water-wall interaction to the water intermolecular interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>. Generally, for the water confined in hydrophilic nanopores with a ratio higher than unity, a substantial epitaxial ordering of water is induced and some fluid layers, whose thickness increases with an increasing strength in the water-wall interaction, become locked to the walls (49); hence, the viscosity of water in the vicinity of a wall is higher than that of bulk water <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref>, and a no-slip boundary condition, which is also named multilayer sticking <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, is valid (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). For the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p>The flow of water confined in nanopores is significantly different from that of bulk water. Moreover, understanding and controlling the flow of the confined water remains an open question, especially concerning whether the flow capacity of the confined water increases or not compared with that of bulk water. Here, combining a theoretical analysis and data from molecular dynamics simulations and experiments in the literature we develop a simple model for the flow of water confined in nanopores. We find that a contact angle and a nanopore dimension may substantially affect the confined water flow. We also quantitatively explain a controversy over an increase or decrease in flow capacity.</p><p>water confined in midwetting nanopores the ratio likely equals unity, and the no-slip boundary condition still holds, whereas the viscosity of water near walls decreases due to an existing depletion region near the walls (52) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). However, for the water confined in hydrophobic nanopores with a ratio smaller than unity, the assumption of the noslip boundary condition breaks down <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>; in other words, water molecules can move directly along walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>, which can be described by a true slip length, and, furthermore, the viscosity of water near the walls significantly decreases (56) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</p><p>The viscosity of the confined water, which is a function not only of wall properties but also a nanopore dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>, and the true slip length play a crucial role in the flow behavior of water confined in nanopores. Here, the true slip length l s,t , defined in the standard partial slip boundary condition, is a ratio of the slip velocity to the shear rate at the effective hydrodynamic boundary position, and thus it cannot be negative; additionally, the effect of a varying viscosity on the confined water flow can be treated by an apparent slip length modeled by a continuum theory, as shown in l s,a in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>True Slip Versus Wettability. The flow of confined water depends strongly on the slip length, and an accurate modeling of the water flow at the nanoscale depends on reliable calculations and/or measurements of this quantity. Whether the true slip of water near nanopore walls occurs is a result of the water-wall interaction. The strength of this interaction can be characterized by wettability <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>. Hence, there exists a relationship between true slip and wettability for the majority of water-wall systems. By this physically motivated argument, the true slip length of water as a scaling function of a contact angle can be described as ( <ref type="formula">58</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">l s,t = C=ðcos θ + 1Þ 2 , [1]</formula><p>where l s,t is the true slip length of water at walls, θ is the contact angle (a calculation method is provided in SI Appendix, SI Text, section A), and C is a constant for a liquid, fitted with experimental or MD simulation data. Note that C as a constant is only valid for a liquid with a constant viscosity, and we assume that it is also a constant in this work.</p><p>To calculate accurately the true slip length, a curve with C = 0.41 fitted by the MD simulation data should be adopted rather than that by the experimental data, as shown in SI Appendix, SI Text, section B, because a measured value from experimental data is an effective slip length as a function of many factors, such as wall wettability <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>, wall roughness <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, nanobubbles <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>, operation conditions (32), and fluid viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. One should pay much attention to the accurate determination of a contact angle higher than 145°because its small error can contribute a huge variation in the true slip length (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). It is noted that the true slip length is not exclusively controlled by the wall wettability, which has been confirmed by many scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>, as shown in SI Appendix, SI Text, section B. Thus, one uses Eq. 1 with the utmost caution. In addition, the true slip length, determined by Eq. 1, is on the basis of MD simulation data for an unconfined liquid with a constant viscosity.</p><p>Viscosity Versus Wettability and Confinement. The true slip length is small, 0-25 nm for contact angles of 0-150°(SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). However, Majumder et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> published a paper that indicated that an effective slip length ranging from 39 to 68 μm would be required to reproduce the measured water flow rates in 7-nm aligned, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In the following year, Holt et al. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) measured water flow rates through 1.3-to 2.0-nm double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), and the required effective slip lengths were found to be up to 1.4 μm. Moreover, an effective slip length can even be a negative value, which is also named multilayer sticking, indicating that several adsorbed layers are immobilized at walls. The experiments by Chan and Horn <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> provided strong evidence in this case. Hence, in addition to true slip, other unique physics need to be responsible for the existing wide range of effective slip lengths. The apparent slip, caused by a varying viscosity of confined water, may be the most accredited one of them. Many experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref> and MD simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69)</ref> have demonstrated that the viscosity of the confined water is spatially varying, which stems from the variations of structural and dynamical properties of the confined water as a result of the interaction force exerted by nanopore walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>.</p><p>To obtain an effective viscosity of the confined water a weighted average of the viscosities in the interface and bulk-like regions in nanopores is adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">μðdÞ = μ i A i ðdÞ A t ðdÞ + μ ∞ 1 - A i ðdÞ A t ðdÞ , [<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">]</formula><p>where μ i and A i are the water viscosity and area of the interface region, respectively, μ ∞ is the viscosity of bulk water, A t is the total cross-sectional area, and d is the nanopore diameter.</p><p>The effective viscosity strongly depends on the water viscosity and area of an interface region. The area of the interface region can be calculated by a critical thickness, which is defined as one above which water is expected to behave like bulk water without being affected by an interaction from walls. The critical thickness can be determined as 0.7 nm on the basis of spatially varying structure and dynamics of the confined water by experiments and/or MD simulations, as shown in SI Appendix, SI Text, section C and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>. The water viscosity in the interface region, also strongly affected by the interaction from walls, is a function of a contact angle. Based on the results from experiments and MD Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Schematic representation of water flow in nanopores. From A to E, the strength of a water-wall interaction decreases and the contact angle increases. True slip occurs at a molecular level, where water molecules are effectively sliding on walls, and its value l s,t cannot be negative. Apparent slip does not occur on walls but at water/water interfaces due to the varying viscosity of water near the walls, and its value l s,a can be negative or positive depending on the wall wettability. Effective slip, a linear sum of true slip and apparent slip, refers to the case where true and/or apparent slip is estimated by an appropriate method (averaging) without tedious calculations for modeling the confined water flow, and its value l s,e can be negative, zero, or positive. (A and B) Apparent slip with a negative slip length, where the water-wall interaction is larger than the water intermolecular interaction, and red squares are the regions with high viscosity at which the water molecules keep static relative to the walls. (C) Apparent slip with a positive slip length, where the water-wall interaction equals the water intermolecular interaction, and red arrows are the regions with low viscosity due to the existing depletion regions. (D and E) Apparent and true slip with both positive slip lengths, where the water-wall interaction is smaller than the water intermolecular interaction, and red arrows are the regions with low viscosity. Note that effective slip equals apparent slip due to the true slip of zero in A, B and C, whereas its value is a linear sum of apparent and true slip lengths with a finite and infinite slip length in D and E, respectively. simulations (50, 68, 71-80) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), a linear relationship between the ratio μ i /μ ∞ and the contact angle can be correlated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">μ i μ ∞ = -0.018θ + 3.25. [3]</formula><p>The viscosity in the interface region increases as the contact angle decreases, because the stronger the interaction from walls the denser a hydrogen bonding network and the more ordered and stable structure that yields stronger hydrogen bonds in the interface region <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>. Also, compared with bulk water, the water viscosity in the interface region is smaller or larger for the water confined in hydrophobic <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref> or hydrophilic <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74)</ref> nanopores, respectively, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Several points are noteworthy. First, in fact, the viscosity in the interfacial region is not constant but is a function of confinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>; as the nanopore diameter decreases, it increases for nanopores with hydrophilic walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, whereas it decreases for nanopores with hydrophobic walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79)</ref>. Second, the viscosity in the interfacial region can be three to six orders of magnitude higher than the bulk water viscosity for a nanopore with a diameter smaller than 1 nm and hydrophilic walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>, whereas it decreases very quickly but is still larger than bulk water viscosity when the nanopore diameter is larger than 1 nm (71). Third, we assume that the viscosity in the interfacial region in Eq. 3 is a constant for a nanopore with fixed wettability and a diameter of larger than 1.4 nm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Thus, Eq. 3 is only applicable in water confined in a nanopore with a diameter of larger than 1.4 nm. Fourth, the behavior of water flow through a nanopore with a diameter of smaller than 1.4 nm changes very quickly with the diameter due to a dramatically varying viscosity in the interfacial region <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>, and thus determining the water viscosity in the interfacial region becomes key to model flow behavior at this small nanoscale. Finally, classical MD simulations may be unable to represent the interfacial dynamics well at a quantitative level due to their limitations, although they can do so at a qualitative level. Therefore, we should exercise exceptional care in adopting the water viscosity in the interfacial region obtained by MD simulations for nanopores with a diameter of smaller than 1 nm, although MD simulations are able to reproduce the viscosity for nanopores with a diameter of larger than 1 nm (81), and thus MD simulations are relatively reliable in modeling the water flow using the viscosity obtained by them. A further literature review on the water viscosity in the interfacial region is included in SI Appendix, SI Text, section D.</p><p>The effective viscosity calculated by Eq. 2 matches very well with the results from MD simulations and experiments (SI Appendix, SI Text, section E). The effective viscosity is a function not only of a contact angle but also of confinement, because the interaction from walls becomes increasingly dominant as the pore dimension shrinks to a nanoscale region, which causes the portion of water molecules in the interface region to increase relative to the total water molecules present in nanopores <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>Water Flow Through Nanopores. It may be feasible that the water flow through nanopores is modeled by the continuum fluid mechanics when the characteristic flow dimension is larger than 1.6 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.

Here, for the water confined in nanopores with diverse types and dimensions, although a wide range of enhancement factors span over six orders of magnitude, this model is still able to simulate accurately the majority of these confined water flows, which suggests that it successfully captures or reflects the underlying physics behind these different flow behaviors, including the water structure and dynamics and the three boundary conditions of multilayer sticking, no-slip, and slip at walls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the main conclusive results in this study, namely the dependence of the confined water flow on wettability and confinement.</p><p>In particular, our results demonstrate that the flow capacity of confined water can decrease one order of magnitude because of multilayer sticking, whereas it can increase up to seven orders  of magnitude due to the effective slip compared with that of bulk water for nanopores with a wide range of wettability here investigated, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>. The huge difference in the enhancement factor is caused by the significantly different strength of the interaction from nanopore walls. The stronger the interaction the larger the activated energy needed for the molecular motion of the confined water <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83)</ref>. These results reconcile the two contradictory trends of a flow capacity variation of the water confined in various nanopores, namely, a debatable issue that the flow capacity of the confined water decreases or increases compared with that of bulk water. Furthermore, they show that not only nearly frictionless walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84)</ref> and nanobubbles <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86)</ref> but also strong hydrophobic walls are able to enhance enormously the flux of the confined water.</p><p>In addition, a small difference in the nanopore dimension has a big effect on the confined water flow due to the strong dependence of the structure and dynamics of the confined water on the dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref>, especially for nanopores with a diameter smaller than 10 nm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>. Similar results have been observed in many experiments. The enhancement factor for the confined water through 44-nm carbon pipes measured by Whitby et al. ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) is much smaller than those observed through the smaller CNTs with diameters of 7 nm and smaller than 2 nm by Majumder et al. ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) and Holt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, respectively, although it is nevertheless substantial over an order of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, implying that the unique phenomena of the confined water flow occur to a significant extent even in relatively large nanopores. However, for the water confined in pores with a diameter of larger than 200 nm and a contact angle of smaller than 150°, the enhancement factor by our model is smaller than 2, which may provide a reason that Sinha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(88)</ref> did not detect enhancement of the water flow through nanopipes with diameters ranging from 200 to 300 nm.</p><p>Although the results by our model are possibly limited to a system of nanopores with ultrasmooth walls and the confined water without any dissolved gas or contaminant, the conclusions elucidate a general understanding of the flow behavior of water confined in nanopores with varying wettability and dimensions, which can have an important impact in some theoretical studies and industrial applications. Most importantly, the proposed model is simple and effective in modeling the confined water flow, which overcomes the main shortcomings of MD simulations with computational limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75)</ref> and timeconsuming experiments with high costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89)</ref>. However, it is noted that our model does not consider end effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>, which may cause an error in modeling the nanoconfined water flow for nanopores with a short geometric length of any friction or a low inner friction with any length <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref>. A further literature review on end effects is included in SI Appendix, SI Text, section F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In summary, we have investigated the flow of water confined in nanopores with different wettability and dimensions by the combination of a theoretical analysis and data from MD simulations and experiments in the literature. Our results have demonstrated that the effective slip length is a crucial parameter controlling the flow of the confined water, which is a linear sum of the true and apparent slip lengths. Here, the true slip length depends on a contact angle, whereas the apparent slip length, caused by a spatial variation of the confined water viscosity, is a function of wettability as well as the dimension. A model is proposed from the modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation, taking the wettability and dimension into account, and is successfully applied to model the confined water flow with a wide range of enhancement factors of 10 -1 to 10 7 . The results by this model are in agreement with the majority of 53 different cases from the literature. This model is also able to quantitatively explain a controversy in MD simulations and experiments over an increase or decrease in flow capacity. This work further demonstrates the effectiveness of the continuum fluid mechanics and provides a simple and valuable tool in modeling the flow of water confined in nanopores with a diameter larger than 1.6 nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Idea of the Model. We model the confined water flow by considering viscous flow resistance and water-wall interface resistance. The viscous flow resistance is described by apparent slip stemming from a spatial variation of the confined water viscosity, and the water-wall interface resistance is characterized by true slip.</p><p>Calculation of a True Slip Length. We assume that the true slip length is a function of a contact angle and calculate it by using Eq. 1 with C = 0.41 fitted by the MD simulation data rather than that by the experimental data. More details are included in SI Appendix, SI Text, section B.</p><p>Calculation of an Apparent Slip Length. We can obtain the apparent slip length by Eq. 6 with a known effective viscosity. We calculate an effective viscosity of the confined water by a weighted average of the viscosities in the interface and bulk-like regions in nanopores. The effective viscosity strongly depends on the water viscosity and area of an interface region. The water viscosity in the interface region is obtained by Eq. 3, and the area of the interface region is calculated by a critical thickness of 0.7 nm, as shown in SI Appendix, SI Text, section C and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>nanoconfined water flow | nanopores | wettability | slip | viscosity</figDesc></figure>
