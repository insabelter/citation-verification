<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Genetic variation is an essential feature of biological variety for conservation methods, particularly for scarce and strictly endemic species. Iran's population genetic structure, genetic variation, and morphological variations are all unknown. Because of the therapeutic value of this species, six regional populations of Aegilops tauschii were studied for genetic diversity and population structure. To uncover within and among population genetic variation in this plant, we employed six inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and 15 combined IRAP markers. The AMOVA test indicated a substantial genetic difference (PhiPT = 0.66, P = 0.010) among the tested populations, as well as the fact that 85 percent of overall genetic differences was related to within-population variety and 15 percent to genetic divergence across populations. The Mantel test revealed a substantial positive connection between genetic distance and geographical distance across the populations investigated. Based on (IRAP) markers, these findings suggested that regional populations of Aegilops tauschii are well separated.</p></div>

However, rather than genetic differentiation, phenotypic plasticity may be a better approach to adapt genotypes to environment; specifically, increased environmental diversity supports higher degrees of plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(HAHN et al., 2012)</ref>. Approximately 8,000-10,000 years ago, a natural hybridization of tetraploid wheat with Ae. tauschii resulted in the development of hexaploid wheat, with Ae. tauschii providing several genes that increased climate tolerance and enhanced bread making quality <ref type="bibr">(BELL, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">KIHARA, 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">MCFADDEN and SEARS, 1946;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">YAMASHITA et al., 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr">KERBER and TIPPLES, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">LAGUDAH et al., 1991)</ref>. This wild D-genome donor, on the other hand, has a lot more genetic variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(NAGHAVI et al., 2009)</ref>. In comparison to the wheat D-genome, Aegilops tauschii has a lot of genetic diversity for diseases and abiotic resistance factors. Ae. tauschii is divided into two subspecies by MCFADDEN and SEARS <ref type="bibr">(1946)</ref>, Ae. tauschii subsp. tauschii and Ae. tauschii subsp. strangulata (Eig) Tzvel. Under the subsp. tauschii umbrella, four variants have been identified: var. tauschii, var. meyeri (Griseb.) Tzvel, var. anathera (Eig) Hammer, and var. paleidenticulata (Gandilyan) Hammer. The large, cylindrical spikelets of the tauschii subspecies are distinctive. More quadrate spikelets of similar length and breadth describe the subsp. strangulata. Some scientists have also identified the intermediate types <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(KIM et al., 1992)</ref>. Phenotypic categorization of subspecies, particularly variations, is difficult. As a result, phenotypic data frequently do not match well with genetic categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(LUBBERS et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">DVORAK et al., 1998)</ref>. Due to hybridization and the development of intermediate forms, the phenotypic divides in A. tauschii may not always be discernible <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(KIHARA et al., 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr">DVORAK et al., 1998)</ref>. This also suggests that Ae. tauschii morphological variations should not necessarily be utilized to predict genetic heterogeneity at the molecular level.</p><p>The subsp. strangulata develops mostly between Rasht and Azadshahr on the southern beaches of the Caspian Sea, whereas the subsp. tauschii grows to the eastern and western parts of this area <ref type="bibr">(KERBER and TIPPLES, 1969)</ref>. The D-genome source of T. aestivum is thought to be Ae. tauschii populations in Iran's southwest Caspian Sea (KERBER and TIPPLES, 1969) and neighboring mountainous regions in Azerbaijan. This is due to the waxy bloom alleles' distribution in the populations that exist in the areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(NAKAI, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>The goals of this work were to use the inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) approach to explore genetic diversity across Aegilops tauschii cultivars/populations with diverse geographical origins, and to use IRAP markers to detect genetic variation among and within materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant materials</head><p>During the months of July-August 2016, 85 individuals from six natural populations of Aegilops tauschii were sampled in Iran's East Azerbaijan, Mazandaran, and Guilan provinces (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Fig 1)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population genetic differentiation</head><p>Gst analysis (0.657, p = 0.001) and AMOVA (PhiPT = 0.66, P = 0.010) indicated significant differences across the analyzed groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). It also indicated that withinpopulation genetic variety accounted for 25% of overall genetic variability, whereas amongpopulation genetic difference accounted for 75%. The results of pairwise AMOVA showed a substantial difference between the groups examined. Furthermore, after 999 permutations, we obtained high values for the Hedrick standardized fixation index (G'st = 0.657, P = 0.001) and the Jost differentiation index (D-est = 0.886, P = 0.001). These findings suggest that Aegilops tauschii regional populations are genetically distinct from one another.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Populations , genetic affinity</head><p>In the NJ tree, two large clusters emerged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The first major cluster includes two sub-clusters: the Gilan population, Bandar-e Anzali (pop. No. 4, ssp. tauschii), is different and stays separated from the other populations by a significant distance. The remaining populations from ssp. tauschii and ssp. strangulate, which exhibited close genetic affinity, constituted the second sub-cluster. Only ssp. tauschii was found in the second main cluster, which was distant from the other investigated populations and joined them at a large distance.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The plant specimens of each analyzed subspecies were not clustered together as a consequence of these findings, demonstrating that the subspecies are not demarcated by IRAP molecular markers. Consequently, this research backs up our morphological findings. In these groups, the Mantel test revealed a strong connection between genetic distance and geographical distance (r = 0.88, P = 0.001) after 5000 permutations. As a result, populations that are further</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>apart geographically have less gene flow, resulting in isolation by distance (IBD) in Aegilops tauschii.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Populations genetic structure</head><p>The presence of two genetic groups is shown when K = 2. Evanno test on STRUCTURE analysis found a large peak at k = 2, which yielded a similar result. Both of these studies found that Aegilops tauschii populations are genetically stratified.</p><p>Using a k = 2 STRUCTURE plot, the genetic differences between populations 4-6 (differently colored) and 1-3 were highlighted. However, it revealed genetic similarity between populations 2-3. (similarly colored). For all IRAP loci, the mean Nm = 0.22 was found, indicating little gene flow across populations and supporting genetic differentiation as demonstrated by K-Means and STRUCTURE studies. The results of the population assignment test backed with Nm's findings, indicating that there was no considerable gene flow between these groups. Nevertheless, a reticulogram based on the lowest square approach (Figure not included) found several common alleles between populations 1 and 5, as well as populations 3 and 6, as well as populations 2 and 5. Because these populations were put near to one other, this result agrees with the grouping we got with the PCoA diagram. These common alleles form a relatively small percentage of the genomes in these populations, as indicated by the STRUCTURE plot based on the admixture model, and all of these data concur in indicating a high degree of genetic stratification among Aegilops tauschii populations. A total of 88 IRAP bands (loci) were acquired, with 25 of them being private. There were 1-6 private bands in populations 1 and 5-6. DISCUSSION In genetic and breeding research, population genetics analyses are crucial. They give data on genetic diversity levels, genetic variability partitioning within and across populations, inbreeding and outcrossing, effective population size, and population bottlenecks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(ELLIS and BURKE, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">JI et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">YIN et al., 2021)</ref>. The use of molecular markers has considerably aided population genetic research. Among the various Salicornia accessions, these markers have been utilized to identify possibly unique genotypes <ref type="bibr">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI, et al. 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017c</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017d)</ref>. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) have all been used to measure genetic variation and relationships in cultivars and landraces in recent years <ref type="bibr">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI, et al. 2018a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2018b</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2018c</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2018d)</ref>. The majority of plant genomes are made up of transposable elements, mainly retrotransposons. Their replication produces genetic variation, making them a valuable source of molecular markers <ref type="bibr">(SMYKAL et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">MA et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">PENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">SI et al., 2021)</ref>. By amplifying the segments of DNA between two retrotransposons, the inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) approach shows insertional polymorphisms. It's been utilized in a number of genetic diversity investigations <ref type="bibr">(BI et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">CHENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">ZHENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHU et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">JIA et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The genotypes were subjected to cluster analysis using the UPGMA method, according to LUBBERS et al. <ref type="bibr">(1991)</ref>. Durum wheat was in a different class in this group, but subsp. There was no separation between strangulata and subsp. tauschii. The morphological analyses and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R E T R A C T E D</formula><p>geographical locations of the Ae. tauschii accessions did not support this categorization. In fact, no subspecies or geographical locations were used to classify the animals. There was no significant grouping based on the accessions' or subspecies' geographic location, which is consistent with our findings. There was no significant categorization according to geographical areas or subspecies in the SSR marker research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">SAEIDI et al. (2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">LUBBERS et al. (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">PESTSOVA et al. (2000), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">SAEIDI et al. (2006)</ref> all reported on Iran's great genetic diversity. The highest amount of variety in Ae. tauschii may be found in Iran's north (South of Caspian Sea). Ae. tauschii also has a lot of genetic variety based on physical features, indicating that the Iranian genepool has a lot of promise for this species. The ISSR data was unable to distinguish between the tauschii and strangulata subspecies. This might be owing to the tauschii and strangulate subspecies being classified separately. Indeed, gene flow between the two subspecies in Iran has the potential to reduce genetic divergence between them.</p><p>In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">KIHARA et al. (1965)</ref> discovered intermediate and hybrid subspecies. By examining a highly conserved section of ribosomal DNA in Aedes tauschii subspecies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">KIM et al. (1992)</ref> were unable to identify ssp. strangulata genotype from ssp. Tauschii genotype. The morphological trait-based categorization did not match the SSR marker-based and geographical region-based classification. According to VOJDANI and MEYBODI <ref type="bibr">(1993)</ref>, there is no link between morphological and ecogeographic diversity.</p><p>Many investigations have shown that morphological diversity-based division does not correspond to genetic division. As a result, the Ae. tauschii genepool occurs in close proximity to the strangulata genepool, and the genetic categorization differs from the morphological classification. Gene flow is negatively related to gene differentiation, although it is critical for population evolution and occurs between populations via pollen and seeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(SONG et al., 2010)</ref>. The observed gene flow (Nm) among Ae. tauschii subspecies in this study was 0.11, indicating modest genetic divergence among Ae. tauschii subspecies. One of the key origin places for Ae. tauschii, according to research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">LUBBERS et al. (1991) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">PESTSOVA et al. (2000)</ref>, is the southwest of the Caspian Sea. As a result, research on Iranian Ae. tauschii, particularly in the south of the Caspian Sea, as well as the discovery of genetic variety, are extremely useful in breeding efforts. This is because the major origin location of Ae. tauschii, where bread wheat has originated, is located south of the Caspian Sea <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(LUBBERS et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">PESTSOVA et al., 2000)</ref>. </p></div>

Nema informacija o njegovoj populacijskoj genetičkoj strukturi, genetskoj raznolikosti i morfološkoj varijabilnosti u Iranu. Zbog medicinskog značaja ove vrste, sprovedena je studija genetske varijabilnosti i strukture populacija proučavanjem šest geografskih populacija Aegilops tauschii. Stoga smo koristili šest markera inter-retrotransposon pojačanog polimorfizma (IRAP) i 15 kombinovanih IRAP markera da bismo otkrili unutar i među populacijsku genetsku raznovrsnost kod ove biljke. AMOVA test je proizveo značajnu genetsku razliku (PhiPT = 0,66, P = 0,010) među proučavanim populacijama i takođe je otkrio da je 85% ukupne genetske varijabilnosti posledica unutar populacijske raznolikosti, dok je 15% posledica genetske diferencijacije među populacijama. Mantel test je pokazao signifikantnu pozitivnu korelaciju između genetske udaljenosti i geografske udaljenosti ispitivanih populacija.
