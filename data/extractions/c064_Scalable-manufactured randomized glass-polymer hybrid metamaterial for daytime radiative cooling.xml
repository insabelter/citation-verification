However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface require materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noon-time radiative cooling power of 93 W/m 2 under direct sunshine.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Radiative cooling-deposition of blackbody radiation from a hot object through the infrared transparency window of the atmosphere to the cold sink of outer space-is an appealing concept for the 21st century, where most daily necessities, from power generation to data centers, generate excess heat. In contrast to most of the currently employed cooling methods which require energy and resources to carry heat away, radiative cooling is a passive enhancement of the earth's natural method of cooling itself. Efficient nighttime radiative cooling systems have been extensively investigated in the past, with promising infrared-emissivity in both organic and inorganic materials including pigmented paints <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Daytime radiative cooling, however, presents a different challenge because solar absorbance of just a few percent exceeds the cooling power and effectively heat the surface. Recently proposed nanophotonic devices can effectively reject solar irradiance but emit strongly in infrared <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>, promising for daytime radiative cooling. However, the nanophotonic approach requires stringent, nanometerprecision fabrication, which is difficult to scale up costeffectively to meet the large area requirements of the residential and commercial applications that can benefit most from radiative cooling.</p><p>Polymeric photonics is a growing field attractive for economy and scalability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Hybridization of random optical metamaterials with polymer photonics can be a promising approach for efficient daytime radiative cooling-To date harnessing randomness in photonic systems has yielded amplified spontaneous emission <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>, extremely localized electromagnetic hotspots <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, improved lighttrapping efficiency of photovoltaic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, and negative permeability and switching devices with multi-stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. When electromagnetic resonators in a random metamaterial are collectively excited, the extinction and the optical path length in the material are both enhanced, resulting in nearly perfect absorption at the resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. This implies the great potential for utilizing metamaterials with randomly distributed optical resonators for effective radiative cooling if perfect absorption (emissivity) across the entire atmospheric transmission window can be achieved.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate efficient day-and nighttime radiative cooling with a randomized, glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial. The metamaterial consists of a visibly transparent polymer encapsulating randomly distributed silicon dioxide (SiO2) microspheres. The spectroscopic response spans two orders of magnitude in wavelength (0.3 to 25 μm). Our hybrid metamaterial is extremely emissive across the entire atmospheric transmission window (8-13 μm) due to phonon-enhanced Fröhlich resonances of the microspheres. A 50-μm-thick metamaterial film containing 6% of microspheres by volume has an averaged infrared emissivity &gt; 0.93 and reflects approximately 96% of solar irradiance when backed with a 200-nm-thick silver coating. We experimentally demonstrate an average noon-time (11am -2pm) radiative cooling power of 93 W/m 2 under direct sunshine during a three-day field test, and an average cooling power &gt; 110 W/m 2 over the continuous 72-hour day and night test. The metamaterial was fabricated in 300-mmwide sheets at a rate of 5 m/min, such that in the course of experiment we produced hundreds of square meters of the material.</p><p>The proposed structure of the randomized, glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial contains micrometer-sized SiO2 spheres randomly distributed in the matrix material of polymethylpentene (TPX) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). We used TPX due to its excellent solar transmittance. Other visibly transparent polymers such as Poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyethylene can be used but would slightly increase solar absorption. Because both the polymer matrix material and the encapsulated SiO2 microspheres are lossless in the solar spectrum, absorption is nearly absent and direct solar irradiance does not heat the metamaterial.</p><p>At infrared wavelengths, the encapsulated SiO2 microspheres have drastically different optical properties than that of the surrounding matrix material due to the existence of strong phonon-polariton resonances at 9.7 μm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. We calculated the normalized absorbance (σabs/a 2 ), scattering (σsca/a 2 ), and extinction (σext/a 2 ) cross-sections of an individual microsphere encapsulated in TPX as a function of its size parameter, k0a, for an incident wavelength of 10 μm (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Here k0 is the wavevector in free space and a is the radius of the microsphere. The extinction peaks at a size parameter of ~ 2.5, corresponding to a microsphere radius of ~ 4 μm. The size parameter of the microsphere plays a key role in designing the hybrid metamaterial for radiative cooling. At the small particle (quasi-static) limit, the resonance is purely electric-dipolar in character (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B,</ref><ref type="figure">inset</ref>). At the extinction peak, high-order Fröhlich resonances including both electric and magnetic modes are also strongly excited, which is evidenced by the strong forward scattering shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>, the three-dimensional power scattering function (far-field scattering pattern) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</p><p>The intrinsically narrow linewidth of phonon-polaritons, often a superior advantage in the applications such as infrared sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, can limit here the bandwidth of the highly emissive infrared region. We obtained broadband emissivity across the entire atmospheric window by accessing the high-order Fröhlich resonances of the polar dielectric microspheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. The real and the imaginary parts of the extracted effective index of refraction,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">eff eff n iκ e µ + = ⋅</formula><p>, are functions of wavelength and microsphere sizes, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> for 1-and 8-μm-diameter microspheres. Given the low concentration (6% by volume) and assuming that the microspheres are uniform in size and distribution, we retrieved the effective permittivity and permeability of the hybrid metamaterial from εeff = εp • [1 + iγ(S0 + S1)], and μeff = 1 + iγ(S0 + S1), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, where S0 and S1 are the forward and backward scattering coefficients of an individual microsphere in the encapsulating medium, and the fac-tor γ incorporates the volume fraction, f, and the size parameter, ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">0 3 0 3 2 f k a k a γ   =      </formula><p>. In the case of large microspheres, modal interference between higher order modes makes the hybrid metamaterial strongly infrared-absorbing. More importantly, it becomes nearly dispersionless in the infrared. The dispersion of both the real and imaginary part of the effective index of refraction is less than 9 × 10 -5 /nm across the entire infrared wavelength range (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), in stark contrast to the strong dispersion of polar, dielectric bulk SiO2, ~ 5 × 10 -3 /nm in this same range. The low dispersion provides excellent broadband impedance matching of the metamaterial to free space, resulting in extremely low reflectance for both solar and infrared radiation. A hybrid metamaterial as thin as 50-μm can provide uniform and sufficiently strong absorbance across the entire atmospheric window, resulting in perfect broadband infrared emission for radiative cooling (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). In contrast, when the microspheres are small (k0a &lt;&lt; 1), a sharp resonance occurs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>), which limits the high infrared emissivity to the polariton resonance wavelength only. Moreover, the resonance introduces strong reflectance, further reducing the overall emissivity.</p><p>The hybrid metamaterial strongly reflects solar irradiation when backed with a 200-nm-thick silver thin film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>) prepared by electron beam evaporation. We characterized the spectroscopic performance of the metamaterial thin film in both the solar (0.3 μm to 2.5 μm) and infrared (2.5 μm to 25 μm) regions using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3D</ref>). We used integrating spheres to account for the scattered light from the full solid angle in both spectral regions. The measured spectral absorptivity (emissivity) of the sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3D</ref>) indicates that the 50-μm-thick film reflects ~ 96% solar irradiation while possessing a nearly saturated emissivity &gt; 0.93 between 8 and 13 μm-yielding greater than 100 W/m 2 radiative cooling power under direct sunlight at room temperature. The experimental results agree well with theory, where the spectroscopic discrepancies near 3 and 16 μm wavelengths primarily due to the absorbance of water and air during the FTIR measurement in ambient conditions. We must employ different theoretical approaches for calculating the emissivity in the solar and infrared wavelength ranges. We used the generalized, incoherent transfer-matrix method in the infrared region <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. In the solar region, we instead used rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) because the extracted effective parameters of the metamaterial are inaccurate when the size of the microsphere is greater than the relevant wavelengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. We note that the high emissivity in the second atmospheric window between 16 and 25 μm might be harnessed for additional radiative cooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</p><p>Using a polymer as the matrix material for radiative cooling has the advantages of being lightweight and easy to laminate on curved surfaces. It can accommodate small variations in microsphere size and shape with negligible impact on the overall performance. TPX has excellent mechanical and chemical resistance, offering potentially long lifetimes for outdoor use. However, one of the most compelling advantages of developing a glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial lies in the possibility of cost-effective scalable fabrication. We produced a roll of 300-mm-wide and 50-μmthick hybrid metamaterial film at a rate of 5 m/min (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>). We controlled the volume concentration of the SiO2 microspheres by using gravimetric feeders. The resultant film has a homogeneous distribution of microspheres, with fluctuations in concentration of less than 0.4% (fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. The hybrid metamaterial films are translucent due to the scattering of visible light from the microsphere inclusions (fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. Additionally, when backed with a 200-nmthick reflective silver coating, the hybrid metamaterial has a balanced white color (fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. The strongly scattering and nonspecular optical response of the metamaterial will avoid back-reflected glare, which can have detrimental visual effects for humans and interfere with aircraft operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p><p>We demonstrated real-time, continuous radiative cooling by conducting thermal measurements using an 8-inchdiameter, scalably-fabricated hybrid metamaterial film over a series of clear autumn days in Cave Creek, Arizona (33°49'32"N, 112°1'44"W, 585 m altitude) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). The metamaterial was placed in a foam container that prevents heat loss from below. The top surface of the metamaterial faced the sky and was directly exposed to the air (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. We kept the surface temperature of the metamaterial the same as the measured ambient temperature using a feedback-controlled electric heater placed in thermal contact with the metamaterial to minimize the impacts of conductive and convective heat losses. The total radiative cooling power is therefore the same as the heating power generated by the electric heater if there is no temperature difference between the surface and the ambient air. With the feedback control, the surface temperature follows the measured ambient temperature within ± 0.2°C accuracy during the day and less than ± 0.1°C at night (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. We continuously measured radiative cooling power, which gives an average radiative cooling power &gt; 110 W/m 2 over a continuous 72-hours day-/nighttime measurement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>). The average cooling power around noon reaches 93 W/m 2 with normal-incidence solar irradiance greater than 900 W/m 2 . We observed higher average nighttime radiative cooling than during the day. However, the cooling power peaks after sunrise and before sunset when the ambient tempera-ture is changing rapidly and solar irradiance is incident at large oblique angles. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of radiative cooling, we also used water as cold storage medium and show cold water production with the scalablyfabricated hybrid metamaterial (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. While we did not determine the reliability and lifetime of the glasspolymer hybrid metamaterial for outdoor applications, applying chemical additives and high-quality barrier coatings may enhance their outdoor performance. Many polymeric thin films are currently available and designed with extended outdoor lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.   A feedback-controlled electric heater keeps the difference between ambient and metamaterial surface temperatures less than 0.2°C over the consecutive three days. The heating power generated by the electric heater offsets the radiative cooling power from the hybrid metamaterial. When the metamaterial has the same temperature as the ambient air, the electric heating power precisely measures the radiative cooling power of the metamaterial. The shaded regions represent nighttime hours. (C) The continuous measurement of radiative cooling power over three days shows an average cooling power &gt; 110 W/m 2 and a noon-time cooling power of 93 W/m 2 between 11am -2pm. The average nighttime cooling power is higher than that of the daytime, and the cooling power peaks after sunrise and before sunset. The measurement error of the radiative cooling power is well within 10 W/m 2 (32).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
