<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tissue repair following injury is a complex metabolically demanding process. Depending on the tissue's regenerative capacity and quality of the inflammatory response, the outcome is generally imperfect with some degree of fibrosis, which is defined by aberrant accumulation of collagenous connective tissue. Inflammatory cells multitask at the wound site by facilitating wound debridement and by producing chemokines, metabolites, and growth factors. If this well-orchestrated response becomes dysregulated, it can become a chronic wound or progressively fibrotic, with both outcomes impairing tissue function that can ultimately lead to organ failure and death. Here, we review the current understanding of the role of inflammation and cell metabolism in tissue regenerative responses, highlight emerging concepts that may expand therapeutic perspectives and briefly discuss where important knowledge gaps remain.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Effective tissue repair is critical for the survival of all living organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. After injury, necrotic debris, the clotting reaction, and any invading microbes collectively activate an inflammatory response that is propagated by the local release of chemotactic factors.</p><p>Neutrophils, monocytes, and other innate immune cells are recruited to the wound site, to clear cell debris and infectious organisms, and subsequently help orchestrate the tissue repair response. The degree and duration of the response varies, and this influences the final outcome. There are major benefits from raising an inflammatory response but there are also negative consequences including the activation of a fibrotic response (define the fibrotic response for the non specialist), which is defined by the excessive and aberrant accumulation of collagenous connective tissues that can debilitate tissue function and in some cases lead to organ failure.</p><p>Inflammation following injury is normally modular in nature, with three distinct phases facilitating the restoration of normal tissue architecture. These stages include an early pro-inflammatory stage, where elements of the innate immune response initiate the repair response by mobilizing the recruitment of key inflammatory cells. In the second major phase, the pro-inflammatory response begins to subside, with key inflammatory cells like macrophages switching to a reparative phenotype. In the final stage, tissue homeostasis is restored when the inflammatory cells either exit the site of injury or are eliminated through apoptosis. (The subsequent paragraph is outlining some of the topics and discussion that will be presented throughout the article. At the start of this paragraph, identify the piece as a review article that will explore some of the elements and concepts of inflammation in repair and regeneration so the reader is not looking for reference citations here.)</p><p>This review article will explore some of the newer concepts of inflammation in repair and regeneration and how they offer insights for potential therapeutic modulation to improve healing of tissues in the clinic. Because of recent advances in live imaging of translucent model organisms like zebrafish larvae the dynamic behavior of inflammatory cells can now be viewed as they are drawn to wounds and interact with local cell populations.</p><p>These approaches along with recent mammalian tissue repair studies in multiple organs from skin to liver have revealed how leukocytic cells undergo behavioural switching from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state (define phenotypic switching; split this sentence into two?)and demonstrate how this impacts their dynamic interaction with host tissue cells to either drive fibrosis or mediate its resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Beyond elucidating spatial and temporal cues that govern immune cell function, recent studies have also identified previously unappreciated molecular determinants that orchestrate immune cell responses. In this context, evidence in the nascent field of immunometabolism has revealed how metabolic adaptation is not simply regulated by nutrient availability, but is also controlled by immune signals that govern immune cell function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Therefore, the rapid response of immune cells to tissue injury and the need to adjust their metabolic reprogramming during the repair response may in turn regulate immune cell function at the wound site. Thus, targeting metabolic pathways in immune cells may offer new opportunities to therapeutically modulate the inflammatory response and improve the overall outcome of wound healing responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New insights emerging from live imaging of the wound response</head><p>The immune response to tissue damage and infection was first observed by Metchnikoff in his studies of translucent waterborne creatures in the early 20 th century (4). His classic rose thorn puncture of a starfish embryo was the first evidence for a "wandering" population of cells that are drawn to invading foreign bodies (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref> Real-time fluorescent imaging of GFP-tagged neutrophils has revealed the dynamic influx and resolution of these cells in mammalian skin wounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In mice, studies have also shown that not all wound inflammatory cells are tissue resident or come from the bloodstream. Indeed, a recent sterile liver injury study employing intravital microscopy identified the peritoneum as an important source of macrophages and the authors showed that this pool of macrophages was essential to repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Other murine imaging studies have captured leukocytes as they engage with and then breach the venular wall (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>), or revealed novel in vivo responses following tissue damage including neutrophil "swarming" behaviors after skin wounding <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model organism studies reveal some of the damage attractants and how inflammatory cells respond to these</head><p>At a fundamental cell biology level, we know that immune cells respond to attractant cues via Rho family small GTPase regulation of their actin cytoskeletons. If Rac is knocked down in Drosophila macrophages, they fail to make proper lamellae and efficiently migrate to the wound. If Rho is knocked down, then macrophage-directed migration is unperturbed, but the cells cannot contract and detach their uropod or tail end and thus remain tethered to the spot <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Spatial activation of these small GTPase switches thus enables cells to migrate towards cues as, for example, highlighted in zebrafish larval experiments in which light activation of a genetically encoded Rac is used to artificially turn a neutrophil in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. (Why would you want it to turn experimentally?) (The lower part of Fig 1B could be moved to after 1C. That panel also seems to have too much text so more description here would be helpful-or eliminate unnecessary labels/text.)</p><p>The damage attractants identified in these models include small molecules like H2O2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> but these are clearly not the only attractants. Indeed, mathematical modeling of macrophage response behaviors in a Drosophila pupal wound reveals the nature of the key attractant(s) that trigger these cells to turn towards the wound; these signals travel back through wound fluids/tissues much too slowly to be a small molecule such as ATP or H2O2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. (The preceding sentence is far too long/complex. Please recast.) Immune cell attractants must therefore involve other signals, which will likely include growth factors and chemokines, as well as complement components, and metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Naive immune cells can not respond to a wound attractant; they first need to be primed by other cues that include previous engulfment of apoptotic corpses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Studies in fly and fish are beginning to reveal the mechanisms by which inflammatory cells detect and integrate multiple priming and guidance cues in space and time, en route to the damage site. The translation of these findings will be important in mammalian wound scenarios where the distances travelled are greater and more complex than for the fly and fish model systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resolving the inflammatory response</head><p>After healing is complete, the resolution of inflammation is not simply a passive process.</p><p>Although there is clear evidence in mammalian wounds that many neutrophils undergo apoptosis at the site of inflammation, there is also evidence for the reverse migration of zebrafish neutrophils from sites of inflammation. Tracking studies have suggested that neutrophils, which have already been exposed to one damage site (other description than "experienced a wound site"?) can remain responsive to secondary insults <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. (What does hyper-responsive mean here?) Still other studies have suggested that neutrophils play an active role in the resolution of inflammation by depleting the chemoattractants that initially drew them to the wound site <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. These findings along with our increasing understanding of pro-resolving molecules produced by macrophages and other cells at sites of inflammation offer new therapeutic angles for modulating the trafficking of inflammatory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliance of tissue repair and regeneration on the wound inflammatory response</head><p>The role of the inflammatory response, and specifically the function of macrophages, is not clear-cut. Knockdown of macrophages in rabbits with anti-macrophage serum led to severely impaired healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, whereas no major impact was observed when neutrophils were depleted. Still other studies have suggested that repair can happen independently of any inflammatory response. For example, wound re-epithelialization is so rapid in adult zebrafish that it is almost complete before the inflammatory response is initiated. Similar observations have also been reported with injured mammalian embryos that lack a mature inflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Indeed, neonatal mice that are genetically missing innate immune cell lineages repair injured tissues faster and typically without any evidence of a scar <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. However, the situation is dramatically different in the adult mouse where innate immune cell lineages play critical roles during the repair/regeneration process. In parallel studies of injured liver (which can fully regenerate) and skin (which can repair but leaves behind a scar), macrophages play distinct roles depending on what stage of repair they are depleted. In the liver, macrophage depletion during early repair reduces scar formation; however, if these cells are depleted after the extra cellular matrix (ECM) (define ECM) is laid down, then the normal resolution of fibrosis is impaired <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.In the skin, early macrophage depletion following injury prevents normal granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization, whereas mid-stage depletion results in reduced normal vessel development leading to haemorraging; late-stage depletion of macrophages alters the pattern of scar formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. (Revise preceding sentence for clarity.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regenerative inflammation: an evolutionarily conserved mechanism</head><p>In lower vertebrates that regenerate whole appendages, such as fins and limbs, and even regions of damaged CNS, most studies suggest that inflammation is necessary. For example, if macrophages are depleted during the period of salamander limb blastema formation, regeneration fails and the amputated limb simply heals over <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Tail fin regeneration is similarly blocked in adult zebrafish if macrophages are genetically ablated during the period of blastema proliferation. Once blastema formation is complete, however, macrophages are no longer critical <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>Whereas neuroinflammation in the damaged mammalian brain is generally considered to be a negative influence (what is meant by viewed negatively?) because it triggers glial scarring that hinders axon rewiring, the situation in zebrafish is completely different. Indeed, the adult zebrafish brain and heart can completely regenerate following injury but in both cases the repair is dependent on inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. Macrophages also influence the repair of vascular structures in the brain following injury. For example, live imaging of zebrafish brains showed that macrophages facilitate the ligation of injured vessels by positioning themselves between the two severed ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. The capacity to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue is also seen in mice but only until five days post birth.</p><p>In this neonatal period, macrophage influx is again essential for repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The difference between this neonatal period where regeneration is scar-free (use term other than perfect) and afterwards when hearts heal with a scar is the source and phenotype of the inflammatory macrophage. In the neonate, they are an expanded population of embryonic-derived macrophages, whereas, in the damaged adult heart they are supplemented by pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Interestingly, inhibition of the monocyte-derived source of macrophages enhances adult cardiac repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, as does increasing the numbers of IL-4/IL-13-activated macrophages during postinfarct repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, thereby supporting the view that IL-4/IL-13-mediated polarization of macrophages is the more pro-regenerative phenotypic state. Nevertheless, emerging data has shown that macrophage activation is complex and influenced by ontogeny, local environmental factors and epigenetic changes that enable profound transcriptional reprogramming that influence their functional plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dysregulated tissue repair and inflammation promote pathological fibrosis</head><p>Although the wound inflammatory response drives many aspects of tissue repair and regeneration, it can become dysregulated or chronic, and this may lead to the development of pathological fibrosis or scarring that can disrupt normal tissue architecture and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. As discussed above it is becoming increasingly apparent that monocytes and macrophages may play distinct roles in tissue repair with recruited monocytes often contributing to collateral tissue injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, while the resident tissue macrophage population appears to exert more beneficial properties by exhibiting proresolving, anti-inflammatory, and pro-regenerative activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Nevertheless, there is substantial overlap between both populations, as some studies have shown that inflammatory monocytes can quickly adopt to a homeostatic mode. In some injured tissuesthe most extreme example being toxic liver injury -the recruited monocytes may supplement or permanently replace the resident macrophage population <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</p><p>Because the transformation of pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages to the proresolving phenotype is believed to be critical for normal wound repair and reduction of fibrosis, recent studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms that license these distinct activation states <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core immunological pathways of repair and fibrosis in mammals</head><p>Although numerous mechanisms can contribute to the development of fibrosis, two key immunological drivers of tissue fibrogenesis are TGF- and the type-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. TGF-1 has long been identified as a critical mediator of tissue repair and fibrosis following type 1-and type 17-driven inflammatory responses, which are characterized by the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN- and IL-17A, respectively. Moreover, several studies have concluded that the IL-17A/IL-1TGF-1 axis is important to the development of fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>. In addition, TGF-1 promotes tissue repair and fibrosis via two distinct mechanisms. It suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory mediators that can worsen tissue injury while simultaneously activating myofibroblasts that facilitate wound closure but also deposit aberrant levels and pattern of collagen at the site of repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. IL-13 exhibits similar and overlapping activity in that it functions as both a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine and driver of myofibroblast activation. In contrast to TGF-1 however, IL-13 serves as the dominant mediator of tissue repair and fibrosis during a sustained type 2-polarized inflammatory response, characterized by IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Consequently, dysregulated type-1/17 and type-2 inflammatory responses can each lead to the development of pathological fibrosis; however, distinct mechanisms dominate in each case (38) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). The mechanisms that initiate each response also appear to be distinct with IL-1 and IL-17A activating the TGF-1 pathway and IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP serving as key initiators of type 2-dependent fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. Indeed, expansion of IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells and CD4 + Th2 cells by IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP has been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple tissues including the skin, lung, and liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. CD11b + macrophages also contribute to the development of IL-13-driven fibrosis by serving as key sources of inflammatory chemokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. Nevertheless, although macrophages are important for the initiation of type 2 fibrosis, studies dissecting the specific contribution of IL-4/IL-13 polarized macrophages (M2) concluded that the M2 subset primarily suppresses the development of fibrosis in the lung and liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. A more recent study of skin injury determined that M2 cells also influence collagen fibril assembly in fibroblasts by inducing lysyl hydroxylase-2 that directs collagen cross-linking and the stabilization of collagen <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. In contrast to liver, the dermal component of the skin has limited regenerative capacity in mammals, and healing leaves a scar. Hence, the studies in different organs corroborate the principal tissue protective role of type 2 immunity, but, the different outcome/quality of the healing-promoting activity will likely be tissue specific.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fibrosis and tissue regeneration are distinctly regulated by type 2 immunity</head><p>IL-4 and IL-13 activated macrophages are important producers of a variety of growth factors including TGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1, VEGF-, PDGF, and Relm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Therefore, they have long been implicated in tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>. In addition, other non-immune cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and various stem and tissue progenitor cells have emerged as critical targets of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling following injury. For example, a recent study exploring the mechanisms of liver regeneration following injury showed that IL-4 receptor signaling in hepatocytes is required for proliferation following injury, with eosinophils delivering the IL-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. Another study exploring the mechanisms of hepatic fibrosis following infection identified an important role for IL-4R expression in fibroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>, with IL-13 rather than IL-4 identified as the critical regenerative mediator, and instead of promoting hepatocyte proliferation, IL-13 targeted bile duct epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) and hepatic progenitor cells directly, leading to increased numbers of bile ducts <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. A similar pro-regenerative role for IL-4 has also been reported in a model of skeletal muscle injury where, muscle damage triggered the recruitment of IL-4producing eosinophils, which activated the regenerative actions of muscle resident fibro/adipocyte progenitor cells that support myogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linking metabolism to immune cell repair functions</head><p>Why some immune pathways exhibit tissue protective activity and others play pathogenic roles currently remains unclear. Recent discoveries in the field of immunometabolism have generated considerable excitement because they suggest immune cell metabolic signatures may impact cell plasticity and function and thus, might provide new mechanistic insights into how the immune system regulates repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>.</p><p>As outlined above, macrophages and other cells of the innate and adaptive immune response contribute to tissue repair. However, the various mechanisms that modulate macrophage functional complexity during the different stages of healing are not fully understood. Local microenvironmental conditions found at sites of injury may be inhospitable to effective repair due to a combination of infection, hypoxia, and accumulating metabolites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Although macrophages adapt rapidly to these demanding conditions to combat infection and facilitate tissue repair, their exact bioenergetic needs in these scenarios are still poorly understood. However, these bioenergetic needs are characterized by the activation of multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway as well as fatty acid synthesis and oxidation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>. Nevertheless, the impact of these pathways on tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis remain largely unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glycolysis mediates anti-microbial and inflammatory activity of type 1 immune responses</head><p>The transcription factor HIF-1a that is activated by hypoxia was identified as a key regulator that coordinates the transcriptional programs of glycolytic metabolism and proinflammatory cytokine production in type 1-activated macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>. Recent work has unraveled the regulatory network linking HIF-1a, energetic metabolism, and inflammation. Interestingly, succinate that accumulates as a consequence of a broken TCA cycle in inflammatory conditions, stabilizes HIF-1a, which sustains the proinflammatory phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>. In addition, mitochondrial succinate oxidation by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) maintains LPS-induced inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref> . Along these lines, itaconate, an abundant metabolite of LPS-activated macrophages, dampens inflammation by inhibiting SDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>. Collectively, these studies highlight succinate metabolism as a critical mechanism controlling the macrophage inflammatory state. Indeed, inactivation of HIF-1a in myeloid cells dramatically reduced expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 and initiation of the glycolytic cascade. Accordingly, production of lactate and ATP, in response to LPS was reduced in HIF-1a-deficient macrophages, resulting in compromised antimicrobial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>. These findings demonstrated that type-1activated macrophages exploit glycolysis to fuel their short-lived antimicrobial and proinflammatory functions. In addition, IL-1 and VEGF synthesis, both factors integrally linked to the initiation of the wound healing response was also reduced in HIF-1adeficient macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>. Together, these studies revealed how a single transcription factor serves as a key regulatory node and critically controls anti-microbial activity, energy metabolism, inflammation and key tissue repair mechanisms such as angiogenesis.</p><p>(Please check over the figure to ensure that all labels/features are called out. To simplify the figure, eliminate ones that are not discussed.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oxidative phosphorylation supports tissue protective type 2 immune responses</head><p>A recent study showed that type 2 cytokines serve as key activators of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. OxPhos produces high-energy phosphates in mitochondria that are needed for energetically demanding cell replication, cell growth, and synthesis of macromolecules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Microarray analysis and metabolic studies of type 1-and type 2-activated macrophages revealed that genes important for fatty acid oxidation (FAO) are preferentially expressed in IL-4-and IL-13-activated macrophages.</p><p>Consistently, IL-4-stimulated macrophages showed a higher rate of FAO, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition of OxPhos dramatically attenuated the activation of the type 2-activated phenotype and resulted in increased expression of inflammatory markers. The type 2-activated phenotype could be rescued by transgenic expression of PPAR coactivator 1 (PGC-1), an important mediator of FAO and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the metabolic shift from glycolysis towards OxPhos is paralleled by the transition from an inflammatory towards a pro-resolution M2-like phenotype, thus revealing new therapeutic options to modulate inflammation. An important unanswered question is whether under certain conditions oxidative metabolism might promote unsuccessful healing.</p><p>The in vitro studies above are now supported by in vivo studies showing that pharmaceutical inhibition of lysosomal lipolysis in murine macrophages results in a blockade of IL-4R-mediated macrophage activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>. This study investigated the source of FA and discovered a previously unappreciated role for lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) in cell-intrinsic lipolysis in macrophages. LAL supported FAO, thus revealing an integral role for this enzyme in the activation of the type 2 phenotype in macrophages.</p><p>This study also showed that proper mitochondrial function is required for type-2mediated release of Relm-a from macrophages, a factor involved in type 2-mediated skin fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Finally, a recent study also identified the Akt-mTORC1 axis as a key node calibrating the metabolic demands of type 2 cytokine activated macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emerging concepts in pro-fibrotic mediator blockade</head><p>As type 2 immunity and TGF-1 pathway activation both serve as core drivers of tissue repair and fibrogenesis, numerous therapeutic strategies that modulate specific components of each pathway are currently under development <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>. However, these pathways are also critically involved in normal tissue regeneration following injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. IL-13 and TGF-1 are also well known anti-inflammatory cytokines; therefore, therapeutics targeting these pathways may unleash rebound inflammatory responses that can impair healing, exacerbate tissue injury, and activate autoimmune disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64)</ref>.</p><p>Any successful anti-fibrotic strategy must mitigate these potential negative outcomes.</p><p>Whereas the clinical use of therapeutics that interfere with TGF- signaling have been approved for treatment of a few fibrotic diseases, agents targeting specifically type 2 immunity have not yet been licensed. Instead, they are currently being investigated in the clinic for other repair-related indications, including atopic dermatitis (AD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Phase 3 trials have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerance of an IL-4R-blocking antibody in AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>, and these beneficial reports in AD therapy may facilitate their investigation as anti-fibrotic therapies. Along these lines, a bispecific antibody that neutralizes IL-4 and IL-13 has just been approved in a clinical trial for scleroderma (<ref type="url" target="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://clinicaltrials.gov</ref>), a connective tissue disease for which no disease modifying treatment is currently approved. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future Directions</head><p>It is still unclear how immune cells signal to stromal cells and what the cell and molecular changes are that allow responding cells to proliferate and cause scarring. There is growing evidence that monocyte/macrophage polarization dynamics are critical to instruct immune and non-immune tissue resident cells to both initiate and terminate healing responses. We next need to better understand the hierarchy of molecular determinants that orchestrate these divergent phenotypes that lead to different outcomes in the repair response.</p><p>Much has been learned in immune cell polarization and tissue regeneration from defined responses in experimental prototypic settings (e.g. helminth infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref>), yet future studies need to clarify whether these mechanisms can be generalized. Current evidence suggests that the repair response triggered by core immune pathways is context dependent and is a function of a combination of multiple determinants including the nature of the damage (e.g. pathogen induced, sterile injury or mixed injury pattern), the amplitude and duration of different polarization states as well as the intrinsic regenerative capacity of different organs and tissues.</p><p>In translational terms, the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells is an obvious therapeutic target for dampening the scar response. Tisue repair and fibrosis may also be influenced by directly modulating the inflammatory response and by manipulating known endogenous pro-fibrotic mediators such as TGF-1, osteopontin, hedgehog signaling, and type 2 cytokines among others. In addition, augmenting the actions of pro-resolving molecules like IL-10 and resolvins at the wound site might be another way to encourage resolution after the essential functions of neutrophils and macrophages at the repair site have been accomplished <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. In vitro and in vivo screens are beginning to reveal small molecules/drugs that may trigger early resolution (66) and enable better controlled regeneration of the wound inflammatory response. Additionally, it may be possible to enhance tissue protective mechanisms that are upregulated at the wound site, including, for example, the enzymes downstream of nrf2 signalling that sequester ROS and shield repairing tissue from some of the negative consequences of sustained inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>. All such therapeutic strategies must be engineered in a way that do not negatively impact pro-regenerative pathways.</p><p>Immune cell metabolism also represents a previously unexplored area for therapeutic intervention at sites of tissue repair. However, to date, little detailed information is known about how immune cell metabolism impacts repair mechanisms. In this respect, it is intriguing to speculate that the distinct regenerative capacities of different tissues and organs may be explained in part by their unique metabolic demands. It will also be important to understand whether scarring or failed regeneration results from aberrant shifts in metabolic programming in immune or non-immune cells. Along these lines, a recent systems biology study found parallel metabolic and transcriptional pathways that control macrophage polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref>, revealing potential pharmacological control points.</p><p>Finally, we still do not fully understand why scars are capable of resolving in some tissues such as liver but not in others like skin. Moreover, why organisms like zebrafish display excellent regenerative ability but mammals do not also currently remains unclear.</p><p>Future studies should therefore address whether differences in macrophage origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, recruitment and activation may be an important contributing mechanism explaining this variation between different organs and species. Understanding precisely how these key inflammatory cells are influenced by the wound environment and themselves influence how stromal cells deposit matrix in the repairing tissue will undoubtedly guide us towards therapeutic strategies for managing and improving healing in the clinic.</p><p>(Please provide a brief final overview paragraph to conclude the piece.)   </p><note type="other">Figure legends:</note></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>).
