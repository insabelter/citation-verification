<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In recent years, it has been established that programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1)-mediated inhibition of activated PD-1 + T lymphocytes plays a major role in tumor escape from immune system during cancer progression. Lately, the anti-PD-L1 and -PD-1 immune therapies have become an important tool for treatment of advanced human cancers, including bladder cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of PD-L1 expression in cancer are not fully understood. We found that coculture of murine bone marrow cells with bladder tumor cells promoted strong expression of PD-L1 in bone marrowderived myeloid cells. Tumor-induced expression of PD-L1 was limited to F4/80 + macrophages and Ly-6C + myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These PD-L1-expressing cells were immunosuppressive and were capable of eliminating CD8 T cells in vitro. Tumor-infiltrating PD-L1 + cells isolated from tumor-bearing mice also exerted morphology of tumorassociated macrophages and expressed high levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 )-forming enzymes microsomal PGE 2 synthase 1 (mPGES1) and COX2. Inhibition of PGE 2 formation, using pharmacologic mPGES1 and COX2 inhibitors or genetic overexpression of PGE 2 -degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), resulted in reduced PD-L1 expression. Together, our study demonstrates that the COX2/mPGES1/PGE 2 pathway involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and, therefore, reprogramming of PGE 2 metabolism in tumor microenvironment provides an opportunity to reduce immune suppression in tumor host. PD-L1 | tumor-associated macrophages | PGE 2 metabolism | myeloid cells | bone marrow</p><p>I n recent years, anti-PD-1/programmed cell death protein li- gand 1 (PD-L1) therapy has taken center stage in immunotherapies for human cancer, particularly for solid tumors (1). Cancers with high rates of mutations, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, unresectable or metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and metastatic urothelial bladder carcinoma, appear to be responsive to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 Ab therapies (2-6). Interestingly, most human or mouse tumor cell lines do not express PD-L1constitutively but, at the same time, most surgically removed tumors demonstrate high expression of PD-L1. This fact may suggest that PD-L1 can be induced in tumor vicinity via interaction with tumor-recruited inflammatory cells frequently presented in cancer tissues. Bladder cancer, in particularly, is characterized by the marked infiltration with immune and inflammatory cells such as macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) of bone marrow (BM) origin (6-9). Peripheral blood in cancer patients, including those with bladder cancer, also comprises high numbers of myeloid cells, indirectly indicating that tumors may recruit BM-derived cells to support tumor growth through multiple mechanisms including local immunosuppression in tumor site <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. Taking into account these facts, we hypothesized that close contact of BM-derived myeloid cells with tumor cells could promote expression of immunosuppressive ligand PD-L1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Tumor Cells Promote PD-L1 Expression in BM-Derived CD11b Myeloid Cells, Primarily in Macrophages and MDSCs. Here, we report that coculture of murine BM cells and a murine MBT-2 bladder tumor cell line resulted in strong up-regulation of PD-L1 expression. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>, cultured alone tumor cells did not express PD-L1 on their cell surface, and BM cells cultured alone or in the presence of tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) demonstrated only weak PD-L1 expression. However, coculture of tumor cells with naïve BM cells markedly stimulated PD-L1 expression. Maximal levels of PD-L1 expression reached on day 7 after initiation of BM/ tumor cells coculture and remained steady until day 14 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). The levels of PD-L1 mRNA peaked earlier, on days 4-5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</p><p>Costaining of mixed BM and tumor cells with fluorochromeconjugated anti-PD-L1 and anti-CD11b mAbs revealed that expression of PD-L1 was limited to the BM-derived CD11b myeloid cells (Figs. <ref type="figure">1B</ref> and<ref type="figure">2A</ref>). To investigate the PD-L1expressing cells further, we costained PD-L1 + cells with macrophage marker F4/80 or marker of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and/or inflammatory monocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Ly-6C (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). The obtained data clearly indicate that most PD-L1 + cells (82.5 ± 4.9%) in coculture coexpress F4/80, and some of PD-L1 + cells also can be found within Ly6C-expressing cells (31.7 ± 6.7%). Gr-1 (Ly6C + /Ly6G + ) MDSCs were demonstrated earlier as precursors of tumor-associated macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. To Significance Programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1)-expressing cells mediate tumor evasion from immune system by suppressing activated T lymphocytes. A bioactive lipid prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) formed from arachidonic acid by COXs and PGE 2 synthases (PGESs) facilitates both cancer inflammation and immune suppression. Here, we show that tumor cells can induce PD-L1 expression in bone marrow-derived cells by affecting PGE 2 metabolism in hematopoietic cells. The tumor-induced PD-L1 expression was limited to the myeloid cell lineage and, specifically, to the macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Collectively, the obtained results demonstrate that selective inhibition of PGE 2 -forming enzymes COX2, murine PGES1, or genetic overexpression of PGE 2degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase could provide a novel approach to regulate both PGE 2 levels and PD-L1 expression in cancer, thus alleviating the immune suppression and stimulating antitumor immune response.</p><p>study possible involvement of these cells in the tumor-induced of PD-L1 expression in BM-derived myeloid cells, we cocultured Gr-1-enriched BM cells or whole BM cells from naïve mice with syngeneic MBT-2 tumor cells. The obtained data demonstrate that Gr-1-enriched BM cells represent a superior source of PD-L1 + cells compared with the whole BM (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). We next investigated whether cell-cell contact could be important for tumor-induced PD-L1 expression in BM-derived myeloid cells. Data presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref> show that Gr-1-enriched BM cells produce highest levels of PD-L1 expression in F4/80 + macrophages when myeloid cells have full contact with tumor cells and not separated by the membrane.</p><p>PD-L1-Expressing Macrophages Are Immunosuppressive. Previous studies showed that PD-L1 expression may mediate immune suppression by facilitating apoptosis of activated T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. To test whether PD-L1-expressing BM-derived myeloid cells could also promote inhibition of T lymphocytes, we isolated PD-L1 + cells from cocultures of MBT-2 tumor cells and BM cells, and then coincubated those PD-L1-expressing cells with murine splenic T lymphocytes activated with CD3/CD28 Abs as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Number of CD8 T lymphocyte in cocultures was evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. Data presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5</ref> indicate that PD-L1-expressing BM-derived cells are able to reduce numbers of activated T lymphocytes through apoptosis suggesting the potential role of these immunosuppressive cells in tumor-induced immune suppression and tumor evasion from immune system.</p><p>Tumor-Infiltrating PD-L1 + Cells Demonstrate the Macrophage's Nature and Up-Regulated Expression of the PGE 2 -Forming Enzymes COX2 and Murine PGE 2 Synthase 1. Because MBT-2 tumor cell line itself is negative for PD-L1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), we next investigated whether PD-L1 expression could appear in tumor tissues after injection of MBT-2 tumor cells in mice. After injection of MBT-2 tumor cells into syngeneic C3/He mice, developed tumors were surgically resected. Single-tumor cell suspensions were prepared by digestion of tumor tissue and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-PD-L1 Abs. As expected, in contrast to the cultured alone tumor cell line, tumor tissues obtained from tumor-bearing animals were positive for PD-L1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>). To explore the nature of these PD-L1expressing cells, the PD-L1 + cells were isolated from tumor tissue. Morphology of tumor-infiltrating PD-L1-expressing cells closely resembled the morphology of tumor-associated macrophages with highly vacuolized cytoplasm and typical macrophage appearance (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>, Left, and Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). When PD-L1 + cells were placed in culture plastic plates (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>, Right), these cells, unlike the PD-L1 - tumor-enriched cell fraction, became highly adherent and acquired elongated shape characteristic for the cultured macrophages.</p><p>In contrast to PD-L1 + cells, their PD-L1 -cell counterparts were mostly represented by tumor cells. Collectively, these results and the data obtained from experiments with cocultured BM and tumors illustrate that recruited myeloid cells of BM origin, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MDSCs, can up-regulate PD-L1 expression in tumor vicinity. Notably, similar up-regulation of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells was also observed using other tumor models such as T24 bladder and LnCAP prostate tumors grown in NSG mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</p><p>Next, we explored possible mechanisms underlying the tumorinduced PD-L1 expression in myeloid cells. It has been shown earlier that tumors frequently affect metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) in myeloid cells which results in increased secretion of bioactive inflammatory and immunosuppressive AA lipid metabolites eicosanoids such as prostaglandins or leukotrienes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. We hypothesized that aberrant lipid metabolism in TAMs and MDSCs could affect PD-L1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we first isolated PD-L1 + cells from MBT-2 tumors and measured prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) production by the PD-L1 + and PD-L1 -cell fractions. The data presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref> demonstrate that PD-L1 + cells exhibited high levels of expression of PGE 2 -forming enzymes COX2 and microsomal PGE 2 synthase 1 (mPGES1) and also (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>) secreted substantial amounts of immunosuppressive lipid PGE 2 . obtained results demonstrate that tumor-infiltrating PD-L1 + myeloid cells express high levels of PGE 2 -forming enzymes COX2 and mPEGS1 and, subsequently, secrete substantial levels of PGE 2 . Moreover, inhibition of PGE 2 formation using pharmacologic inhibitors markedly attenuated the tumor-induced PD-L1 expression.</p><p>Because both BM-derived myeloid cells and tumor cells secrete PGE 2 , it was of interest to determine an individual contribution of myeloid and tumor cells to the mechanism of PGE 2dependent induction of PD-L1 expression. To this end, naïve murine BM cells and murine bladder tumor MBT-2 cells were separately pretreated or with pharmacologic PGE 2 inhibitors and then cocultured for 5 d before the measurement of PD-L1 expression. The obtained results demonstrated (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>) that only coculture of pretreated BM cells with untreated tumor cells, but not coculture of naïve untreated BM cells with pretreated tumor cells, prevented the up-regulation of PD-L1 in BM-tumor cells cocultures. These data suggest that expression of PD-L1 expression is regulated through enhanced metabolism of PGE 2 in the BM-derived myeloid cells but not in tumor cells. Nevertheless, tumor cells presumably are also involved in up-regulation of PD-L1 expression in macrophages through direct cell-cell contact (Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>), leading to deregulated PGE 2 metabolism in the myeloid cells and stimulating its enhanced PGE 2 secretion.</p><p>Genetic Overexpression of the PGE 2 -Degrading Enzyme 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenase Reduces PD-L1 Expression. It is well established that PGE 2 levels are regulated not only by its synthesis but also by its degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. The key enzyme responsible for the biological inactivation of already formed prostaglandins is NAD + -linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). By inactivating endogenous PGE 2 , this enzyme provides a natural way of reducing the level of this lipid mediator. According to previous publications, expression of PGE 2 -forming enzyme COX2 in bladder cancer is frequently up-regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, whereas expression of PGE 2 -degrading enzyme 15-PGDH is reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Moreover, earlier we demonstrated that the tumorinfiltrating myeloid cells also characterized by low 15-PGDH expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Thus, it is plausible that high COX2 and low 15-PGDH expression promotes increased accumulation of PGE 2 in tumor tissue leading to increased expression of PD-L1 observed in in patients with advanced bladder cancer (6). To investigate whether genetic restoration of 15-PGDH expression would be sufficient to prevent a tumor-induced up-regulation of PD-L1, we used a AdMBP adenoviral vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Unlike original parent Ad5 adenovirus, AdMBP vector efficiently transduces primary myeloid cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">S10A</ref>) and provides continuous transgene expression in transduced cells lasting up to 21 d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>). Taking in account high transduction efficiency of this vector, we generated AdMBP-mPGDH vector that encodes the murine 15-PGDH gene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>). To examine effect of AdMBP-mediated delivery of 15-PGDH gene on PD-L1 expression, the whole MBT-2 tumor cell suspensions obtained from surgically resected tumors were ex vivo transduced with AdMBP-mPGDH or control AdMBP vectors. Data presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> demonstrate that adenoviral-mediated expression of PGE 2 -degrading enzyme 15-PGDH results in substantial reduction of both PGE 2 production and PD-L1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">S10B</ref>).  <ref type="formula">3</ref>) vectors. The protein concentration in the cell lysates were determined by the Biuret method using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded for each sample and separated on SDS/PAGE, followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane (Millipore); 15-PGDH protein (predicted protein molecular mass: ∼31 kDa) expression was detected using anti-15-PGDH rabbit polyclonal Ab (Novus Biological) and then processed with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences).</p><p>We next examined whether in vivo administration of commercially available pharmacologic PGE 2 inhibitor such as celecoxib could influence the PD-L1 expression in mice with established bladder tumors. Mice with established MBT-2 tumors received daily intraperitoneal injections of celecoxib or vehicle control for 3 d. Twenty four hours after last injection tumors were collected and expression of PD-L1 was evaluated in tumor tissues. The obtained results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5C</ref>) indicate that in vivo inhibition of PGE 2 significantly reduces the PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that metabolism of PGE 2 regulates PD-L1 expression.</p><p>The tumor-promoting role of PGE 2 in cancer has been demonstrated through multiple mechanisms, including cancer inflammation, tumor-associated immune suppression, tumor angiogenesis, and proliferation/renewal of cancer stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Of note, it is technically challenging to delineate the individual contribution of cancer cells, inflammatory macrophages, and stromal cells to the enhanced PGE 2 production in cancer because all of those cells in the tumor bed interact with each other and can promote induction of COX2/mPGES1 expression through various mechanisms. Our in vitro coculture experiments revealed that tumor cells can induce the PD-L1 expression in BM-derived myeloid cells through cell-cell contact mechanism and in PGE 2 -depending manner. Further experiments showed that tumor-infiltrating PD-L1 + cells expressed the highest levels of PGE 2 -forming enzymes COX2 and mPGES1 and produced highest levels of PGE 2 . PGE 2 inhibition resulted in strong down-regulation of PD-L1 expression. Collectively, the obtained results suggest that bladder tumor cells affect PGE 2 metabolism in BM-derived myeloid cells driving their differentiation toward PD-L1 + macrophages. Recently published studies suggest that COX2/PGE 2 signaling is also important for the proliferation and renewal of bladder stem cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Macrophage-derived PGE 2 also promotes tumor cell dissemination, that is, spreading of metastatic malignant cell from parental tumor <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Therefore, harnessing PGE 2 metabolism in the tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and their predecessors MDSCs, could potentially exert the multipronged cancer therapeutic effects by (i) stimulating anti-tumor response through PD-L1 down-regulation and preserving function of immune T cells, (ii) attenuating renewal of cancer stem cells, and (iii) inhibiting metastatic cancer cell spreading. In addition, improved APC differentiation and reduction of MDSCs in tumor host is also expected.</p><p>Generally, inhibition of PGE 2 can be achieved in patients using COX2 inhibitors such as celecoxib. However, chronic inhibition of COX2 results in undesirable cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects that are due, in part, to reduced levels of prostacyclin PGI 2 and thromboxane A 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. Thus, based on the obtained results, it is reasonable to suggest that selective targeting PGE 2forming enzyme mPGES1 or targeted genetic overexpression of PGE 2 -degrading enzyme 15-PGDH could provide more effective and safe way to combat cancer. In summary, our results strongly imply that COX2/mPGES1/PGE 2 signaling regulates PD-L1 expression in the tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells of BM origin such as TAMs and MDSCs. Increased expression of PD-L1 in tumorrecruited myeloid cell serves as a mechanism for tumor escape from immune system, and therefore, targeting PGE 2 metabolism could help to reduce the PD-L1-mediated immune suppression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>Mice and Tumor Models. All experiments with mice were performed according to protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Florida. Female 6-to 8-wk-old C3/He and NSG mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. The MBT-2 murine bladder carcinoma, human bladder T24, and prostate DU-145 cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Tumor cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 humidified atmosphere in complete culture media. To establish subcutaneous tumors, mice were injected with 1 × 10 6 MBT-2 tumor cells into the left flank of C3/He mice or 3 × 10 6 human cancer cells into the left flank immunodeficient NSG mice. Once tumors reached 1-1.5 cm in diameter, tumor-bearing mice were euthanized in a CO 2 chamber and tumor cell suspensions were prepared from solid tumors by enzymatic digestion as described in SI Materials and Methods. Isolation of Tumor-Infiltrating PD-L1 + Cells. To obtain single-cell tumor suspensions, collected tumor tissues were disaggregated with collagenase mixture as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. For isolation of PD-L1 + cells, we lysed red blood cells with ACK buffer and labeled cells with biotin-conjugated anti-PD-L1 Ab (Biolegend). Positive selection of PD-L1 + cells was conducted using anti-biotin magnetic beads and MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). The viability of isolated cells routinely exceeded 90%, as determined by the expression of 7-AAD using flow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion assays.</p><p>Immunosuppression Assay. To induce PD-L1 expression in myeloid cells, red blood cell-free BM cells from C3/He mice were cocultured with syngeneic MBT-2 bladder tumor cells in 6-well plates (cell ratio, 5:1) for 7 d. PD-L1 + cells were isolated from mixture using anti-PD-L1 magnetic beads. Purified PD-L1 + cells were coincubated with splenic CD3 + T cells (cell ratio, 1:1 and 0.5:1) in 96-well plates in the presence of anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/mL monoclonal) mAbs (Biolegend), as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Seventy-two hours later, cells were collected and labeled with PE-conjugated anti-CD8 mAbs (Biolegend). The number of CD8 cells was enumerated using a fluorescent imaging system.

(A) Modified AdMBP-eGFP adenoviral vector demonstrates superior transduction efficiency of murine BM myeloid cells over parental nonmodified Ad5 adenoviral vector. Representative images demonstrating AdMBP-mediated eGFP expression in transduced cells are shown. CD11b myeloid cells were isolated from murine BM mice using anti-CD11b magnetic beads. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium 1640 supplemented with FBS, antibiotics, and M-CSF. Cells were infected with 5 × 10 3 viral particles (vp) per cell AdMBP-eGFP or control nonmodified Ad5-eGFP. eGFP expression was evaluated at days 3, 7, and 14 postinfection using fluorescent microscopy. (Scale bar: 400 μm.) Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. (B) AdMBP-mediated transduction of tumor cell suspension provides continuous expression of transgene. MBT-2 tumors were grown in mice and then surgically removed. Tumor tissue was digested with collagenase mixture and single tumor cell suspension infected ex vivo with AdMBP-eGFP. Transgene expression was examined on days 7, 14, and 21 using fluorescent microscope; representative images are provided. (Scale bars: 200 μm.) (C) Adenovirus-mediated expression of mouse15-PGDH protein. A549 cells were collected at 48 h after infection with 3 × 10 3 vp per cell AdMBP-eGFP (1), Ad5-mPGDH (2), or AdMBP-mPGDH (3) vectors. The protein concentration in the cell lysates were determined by the Biuret method using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded for each sample and separated on SDS/PAGE, followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane (Millipore); 15-PGDH protein (predicted protein molecular mass: ∼31 kDa) expression was detected using anti-15-PGDH rabbit polyclonal Ab (Novus Biological) and then processed with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences).</figDesc><graphic coords="4,373.73,542.37,71.67,62.78" type="bitmap" /></figure>

(A) AdMBP vector encoding murine 15-PGDH reduces PD-L1 expression in tumor cell suspension prepared from surgically resected MBT-2 murine bladder tumors. Representative images demonstrating overlay of PD-L1 expression (red) and bright field in control tumor suspension, tumor suspensions transduced with mock adenoviral vector, or those transduced with vector encoding murine 15-PGDH. Images taken on day 7 postinfection. (Scale bar: 200 μm.) (B) Forced ex vivo expression of 15-PGDH gene in tumor cell suspension with AdMBP-mPGDH vector results in diminished PGE 2 secretion. PGE 2 concentration was measured in cell-free supernatants using an ELISA kit. Average means ± SD are shown (n = 4). *P &lt; 0.05. (C) In vivo administration of PGE 2 inhibitor in bladder tumor-bearing mice decreases PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue. Mice with palpable MBT-2 tumors were treated with the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib or vehicle control for 3 d as described in Materials and Methods. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, tumors were collected and expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues was measured using fluorescent imaging microscope. Average means ± SD are shown (n = 4). *P &lt; 0.05.</figDesc></figure>
