<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Plasmonic colour printing based on engineered metasurfaces has revolutionized colour display science due to its unprecedented subwavelength resolution and high-density optical data storage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Working principle of the dynamic plasmonic colour display. The concept of our dynamic plasmonic colour display technique is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The dynamic plasmonic pixels comprise Mg nanoparticles, which are sandwiched between titanium (Ti)/Pd capping layers and a Ti adhesion layer. These particles reside on a silicon dioxide film (100 nm) supported by a silicon substrate. In order to render a palette of colours with a broad range, stepwise tuning of the lateral particle size s and the interparticle distance d is employed. Each square (10 mm), which presents a characteristic colour, contains Mg particles that are arranged in a lattice with periodicity of s and d.</p><p>The brilliant colours from the palette can be revealed using reflection bright-field microscopy as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. The charge-coupled device (CCD) image of the palette is captured using a 20 Â objective with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.4. The spectral analysis of the representative colour squares (indicated by the individual horizontal and vertical boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) is carried out and presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the corresponding structures are also included in the same figure. Enlarged SEM images of the representative structures can be found in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. When d increases successively (s ¼ 150 nm), a wide range of colours are observed (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). The reflectance peak exhibits evident red-shifts (see the red-dashed line) with increasing d and thus the periodicity, s þ d. The corresponding simulated reflectance spectra presented by the blue-dotted lines show an overall good agreement with respect to the experimental spectra. The simulated colours using the simulated reflectance spectra and the Commission Internationale de l'E ´clairage (CIE) 1931 colour matching functions agree well with the observed colours. On the other hand, when s increases successively (d ¼ 300 nm), colour tuning is less dramatic (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). The reflectance peak experiences red-shifts (see in the red-dashed line) with increasing s. Meanwhile, a new reflectance peak is observed at shorter wavelengths. The corresponding simulated spectra presented by the blue-dotted lines and the simulated colours both agree well with the experimental results. The details about spectral and colour simulations can be found in Methods.</p><p>To elucidate the underlying physics of the observed spectral characteristics, contour maps of the resonance positions in dependence on d (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>) and s (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) were calculated, respectively. The contributions from the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> of the individual Mg nanoparticles and the Rayleigh-Wood anomalies (RAs) of the particle arrays are indicated using black and white lines, respectively. As shown in Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, the longer-wavelength reflectance peak located in between the black and white-solid lines is associated with a hybrid plasmonic mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , which stems from the excitations of the LSPR and the RA for the Mg/SiO 2 interface. The RA for the air/Mg interface is presented by the white-dotted line.</p><p>To provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of the plasmonic modes, as a representative example, electric field and charge distributions at the respective resonance positions (indicated by the red arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) for the colour square (s150, d300) were calculated. At the resonance of 710 nm, the charge distribution reveals the excitation of a dipolar LSPR mode in the Mg nanoparticle (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). The corresponding electric field distribution demonstrates that the electric fields are confined at the corners of the particle near the Mg/SiO 2 interface. At the resonance of 430 nm, the charge distribution reveals the excitation of a quadrupolar LSPR mode (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). The associated electric fields are localized at the corners of the particle near the air/Mg interface.</p><p>The dynamic behaviour of the plasmonic pixels is enabled by the unique phase-transition of Mg in response to hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . Mg can absorb up to 7.6 wt % of hydrogen and subsequently undergoes a metal-to-dielectric transition to form magnesium hydride (MgH 2 ) (ref. 25). This remarkable capacity surpasses all known reversible metal hydrides in hydrogen uptake capability. Upon hydrogen exposure, the Pd capping layer catalyses the dissociation of hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms, which then diffuse through the Ti capping layer into the Mg particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . The Ti adhesion and capping layers help to release the mechanical stress from volume expansions of Mg (32%) and Pd (11%). The Ti capping layer also has an important role as spacer to prevent Mg and Pd from alloying <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . A movie that records the colour dynamics of the palette upon 10% hydrogen exposure (in nitrogen carrier gas) is presented in Supplementary Movie 1. Different colour squares undergo a series of vivid colour changes until all colours vanish. The hydrogenation process is rather complicated and essentially associated with a gradual decrease of the metallic fraction of the particles, formation of MgH 2 as dielectric surrounding, and simultaneous hybrid particle volume expansion. Such a catalytic process renders dynamic alterations to the reflectance spectra possible as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, thus leading to dynamic colour changes. After hydrogenation, the reflectance spectra become nearly featureless as observed from both the experimental and simulated reflectance spectra in Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">4a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. When all the Mg particles are transformed into MgH 2 particles, the colours of the palette are erased. The optical images of the palette under different illumination intensities can be found in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. It is worth mentioning that the colour changing speed during the hydrogenation process can be manipulated by several key parameters including the thickness of the Pd catalytic layer, the hydrogen concentration, and the substrate temperature. In this work, 10 nm Pd, 10% hydrogen, and room temperature are employed in the different display demonstrations, if not particularly specified.</p><p>To explore the colour transformation kinetics during hydrogenation, evolutions of the exemplary colour squares are investigated as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>. The snapshot images were extracted from Supplementary Movie 1 and are arranged as a function of ln(t). The top figure in  Importantly, the erased colours can be restored through dehydrogenation of the Mg particles in the presence of oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Such reversible colour transformations are of great importance for dynamic display applications. A movie that records the colour recovering of the palette at a concentration of 20% oxygen (in nitrogen carrier gas) is presented in Supplementary Movie 2. The dynamic reflectance spectra of the representative colour squares during dehydrogenation can be found in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>. The oxidative dehydrogenation process involves binding of oxygen with the desorbed hydrogen atoms from MgH 2 to form H 2 O (refs 29,30). This avoids a buildup of hydrogen at the Pd surface, thus facilitating hydrogen desorption. As shown in Supplementary Movie 2, the colours of the palette can be nicely restored. This indicates that the MgH 2 particles are converted back to Mg particles, therefore, displaying brilliant colours again. The dynamic CIE maps for the palette and the selected colour squares in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> during hydrogenation/ dehydrogenation can be found in Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>, respectively.</p><p>Hysteresis is observed, when the colours of the palette evolve along the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways, respectively. This is also seen from the recorded dynamic spectra of the selected colour squares as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The hysteresis behaviour can be attributed to the different changes of the particle geometries, the local hydrogen concentrations in the Mg particles, and the propagation directions of the Mg/MgH 2 interfaces during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, respectively. A simple model has been proposed that after hydrogenation a layer of MgH 2 is formed directly beneath the hydrogenated Ti layer and it proceeds towards the substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . This results in successive spectral red-shifts due to effective thickness decreases of the Mg particles (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>). Subsequently, during dehydrogenation the optical spectra exhibit spectral shifts with hysteresis (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>). A systemic study on the complex hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes in the Mg particles, for example, using environmental transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy will be highly desirable for providing an insightful understanding of the local catalytic kinetics in the Mg particles and their correlated dynamic optical spectra.</p><p>Dynamic display of the max-planck-society's minerva logo. Such plasmonic colour tuning, erasing and restoring based on catalytic metasurfaces open an avenue for a variety of dynamic colour display applications. A direct application is to produce high-quality colour-tunable plasmonic microprints. As a demonstration, the Minerva logo of the Max-Planck Society has been prepared using selected colours and their corresponding matrix numbers from the palette are indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>. A description about the layout generation approach can be found in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. A discussion about the NA dependence and the angle dependence of the colours can be found in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. The representative snapshot images of the selected colour squares during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>. The SEM images illustrating the details of the Minerva logo are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref> shows the performance of the dynamic plasmonic display, and the accompanying movie can be found in Supplementary Movie 3. Upon hydrogen loading, the Minerva logo undergoes dynamic colour changes with the individual colour blocks following the changing routes of the respective colour squares (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). A series of abrupt colour alterations take place within 23 s. Subsequently, the logo starts to fade and completely vanishes after 566 s. Owing to the identical sizing of the constitute Mg nanoparticles, different colours in the logo are erased nearly simultaneously, as discussed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>. Upon oxygen exposure, the logo is gradually restored to its starting state without experiencing drastic colour changes (see Supplementary Movie 4). The restoring process takes B2,224 s to complete. To enhance the durability of our samples, exhaustive optimization of the fabrication procedures has been carried out (see Methods). As a demonstration of excellent reversibility and durability, operation of the Minerva logo display in a number of cycles is shown in Supplementary Movie 5.</p><p>An interesting functionality of our display technique is image 'freezing' at any designated display state, owing to the unique hydrogenation process of Mg, which can be paused in between a fully metallic state (Mg) and a fully dielectric state (MgH 2 ). To demonstrate this aspect, in a new cycle of hydrogenation as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>, the logo display is held at an arbitrary state by switching off hydrogen. For example at 11 s, hydrogen is switched off and only pure nitrogen is present. As a result, the dynamic process halts immediately and the logo display is 'frozen' at the specific colour state (see the green box in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>). When hydrogen is switched on again, the dynamic process proceeds subsequently. The corresponding Movie is presented in the second cycle in Supplementary Movie 5.</p><p>Plasmonic subwavelength animations. Remarkably, the distinct colour transformation kinetics of the Mg particles allows for the realization of the first plasmonic animations with subwavelength resolution. To demonstrate this functionality, a variety of fireworks have been designed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>. The matrix numbers of the selected colours from the palette are labelled next to the individual firework schemes. One of the underlying design mechanisms lies in the fact that Mg particles of different sizes but identical interparticle distance are subject to dramatically distinct colour erasing times during hydrogenation. To this end, fireworks I and IV are designed to display radially explosive effects. Firework V is a spirally propagating animation. Firework II combines both the radial and spiral effects. On the contrary, the inner part of firework III essentially employs Mg particles of identical size but different interparticle distances, which allow for a propagating animation with rich colour variations. The outermost part of firework III utilizes the same design principle as firework I. Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref> presents the optical microscopy image of the fabricated plasmonic firework display. A movie that records the firework animations upon hydrogen exposure is shown in Supplementary Movie 6. The representative snapshot images of the fireworks during hydrogenation are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>. All the fireworks demonstrate dynamic animation effects, which agree well with our design. For example, the balloon firework I displays a clear radially explosive effect, dispatching wave-like colour changes from yellow to orange along the radial axis. Afterwards, the orange colour diminishes along the backward direction until the firework completely disappears. The spiral firework V exhibits a vivid propagating effect following a spiral route with the blue colour gradually disappearing from the exterior.</p><p>Highly secure information encryption. Importantly, our dynamic plasmonic display technique is ideally suited for highly secure information encryption and anti-counterfeiting applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . To achieve a superior security level, a fabrication protocol with smart material processing has been developed. The fabrication procedures are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>. The first information pattern (for example, a letter 'N') is defined in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist using electron-beam lithography (EBL), followed by Ti/Mg/Ti (3 nm/50 nm/5 nm) evaporation using an electron-gun evaporator. Subsequently, the sample is placed in ambient air for 10 min and then loaded back to the evaporator for Pd (10 nm) evaporation. After lift-off, the second information pattern (for example, a letter 'A') is created using EBL with alignment markers, followed by Ti/Mg/Ti/Pd (3 nm/50 nm/5 nm/10 nm) evaporation and lift-off. Due to the formation of thin oxide layers between Pd and Mg, the letter 'N' is inactive to hydrogen. On the contrary, the letter 'A' is active to hydrogen. As shown by the SEM images in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>, the letters in each line do not exhibit any discernable differences, neither can the encrypted information be differentiated using optical microscopy (see the left image in Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>). Only upon hydrogen exposure, the hidden code 'nano Printing' is decrypted as shown in the right image in Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>. The information decryption takes B10 min to complete. The accompanying movie is presented in Supplementary Movie 7. In this regard, information encoded on selected pixels, which are indiscernible to both optical and scanning electron microscopies, can only be read out using hydrogen as decoding key, demonstrating the superior security level of our display technique. Importantly, the information can be reversibly encrypted using oxygen within 40 min (see Supplementary Movie 8). The predicted display images before    demonstrate this ability, Vincent van Gogh's Flowers in a Blue Vase has been utilized as design blueprint (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>). To particularly highlight the colour dynamics of the flowers, the background of the original artwork was removed. The modified design and the optical microscopy image of the fabricated artwork display are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, respectively. The corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref> presents the colour erasing and restoring of the dynamic artwork display. The accompanying movie can be found in Supplementary Movie 9.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Fabrication of Mg metasurfaces. In order to enhance the durability of the samples, exhaustive optimization of the fabrication procedures was carried out. First, a double-layer PMMA resist (250k-2.5% and 950k-1.5%, Allresist) was spin-coated (5 s at  (100 nm)/Si substrate, followed by baking (4 min at 160 °C) on a hotplate. EBL (Raith eLine) was performed with 20 kV acceleration voltage, 20 mm aperture, 130 pA beam current, 6.4 nm exposure step size, 500 mC cm À 2 dose and 100 Â 100 mm 2 writing field. After development (90 s in MIBK and 60 s in isopropanol), an oxygen plasma treatment (5 s) was employed to clean the PMMA opening areas. In all, 3 nm Ti, 50 nm Mg, 5 nm Ti and 10 nm Pd were successively deposited on the substrate through electron-gun evaporation (PFEIFFER Vacuum, PLS-500). The presence of the Ti adhesion layer was found to result in significantly improved particle morphology. The deposition rates for Mg, Ti, and Pd were 1.0, 0.1 and 0.2 nm s À 1 . Instead of following a standard routine using n-methyl pyrrolidinone at an elevated temperature of 65 °C, metal lift-off was carried out in acetone at room temperature, which was found to help preserving the catalytic activity of the Mg nanoparticles over time very well.</p><p>Optical measurements. The colour images were revealed using a NT&amp;C brightfield reflection microscopy set-up (using a Nikon ECLIPSE LV100ND microscope) illuminated by a white light source (Energetiq Laser-Driven Light Source, EQ-99). A digital CCD Camera (Allied-Vision Prosilica GT2450C) was used to capture the colour micrographs with a 20 Â (NA ¼ 0.4) objective. The optical spectra were measured in reflection mode using a microspectrometer (Princeton Instruments, Acton SP-2356 Spectrograph with Pixis:256E silicon CCD camera) with the electric field of the unpolarized light in plane with the substrate surface. The measured reflectance spectra were normalized with respect to that of a bare substrate. All measurements were carried out at room temperature (B 25 °C). The flow rate of hydrogen and oxygen was 2.0 l min À 1 .</p><p>Numerical simulations. Numerical simulations were carried out using commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics based on a finite element method. Periodic boundary conditions and waveguide port boundary conditions were used for calculation of the structure arrays. Perfectly matched layers and background field conditions were used for calculations of the single structures. The simulations were carried out with the substrate. The refractive index of SiO 2 was taken as 1.5. The dielectric constants of Si, Mg, and MgH 2 were taken from Green 37 , Palik <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and Griessen <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . The dielectric constants of Pd and PdH were taken from ref. 40.</p><p>Chromaticity calculations. The colours of different colour squares were calculated using the simulated reflectance spectra and the colour-matching functions defined by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . The spectral power distribution is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P l ð Þ ¼ I l ð ÞR l ð Þ<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>I(l) is the relative radiance spectrum of the white light source. R(l) is the simulated reflectance spectrum. The tristimulus values X, Y and Z are computed through:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X ¼ 1 K Z l x l ð ÞP l ð Þdl<label>ð2aÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y ¼ 1 K Z l y l ð ÞP l ð Þdl<label>ð2bÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Z ¼ 1 K Z l z l ð ÞP l ð Þdl<label>ð2cÞ</label></formula><p>Here, x l ð Þ, y l ð Þ and z l ð Þ are the CIE standard observer functions. The integrals are computed over the visible range (from 380 to 780 nm). K is the normalizing constant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K ¼ Z l y l ð ÞI l ð Þdl<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>The CIE chromaticity coordinate (x, y, z) can be obtained by normalization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x ¼ X X þ Y þ Z<label>ð4aÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">y ¼ Y X þ Y þ Z<label>ð4aÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">z ¼ Z X þ Y þ Z ¼ 1 À x À y<label>ð4aÞ</label></formula><p>It is noteworthy that only two values of (x, y, z) are independent, because the intensity of the incident light source is normalized. To fit the real illumination condition, we transform the coordinate (x, y, z) into the HSL (h, s, l) colour space. HSL is the abbreviation for Hue, Saturation and Luminance. Hue specifies the base colour. Luminance corresponds to the intensity of the reflected light, and it can be adjusted based on the experiment to calibrate the chromaticity calculation conveniently.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 | Working principle and optical characterization of the dynamic plasmonic colour display. (a) Schematic of the plasmonic metasurface composed of hydrogen-responsive Mg nanoparticles interacting with incident unpolarized white light. These Mg nanoparticles are sandwiched between Ti/ Pd capping layers and a Ti adhesion layer. In each colour square (10 mm), they are arranged in a lattice with a period of s þ d along both directions. s and d are the size of the square-shaped particles and the interparticle distance, respectively. The colours of the plasmonic metasurface can be erased upon hydrogen exposure through phase-transition from Mg to MgH 2 . The colours can be restored upon oxygen exposure through transformation of MgH 2 back to Mg. (b) Colour palette obtained by stepwise tuning of s and d. (d) Experimental (black) and simulated (blue-dotted) reflectance spectra of the colour squares selected from b. The spectral curves are shifted upwards for clarity. In (c) and (d), the selected colours correspond to those indicated using solid (dashed) squares along the horizontal (vertical) direction in b. Experimental and simulated colours as well as the corresponding SEM images of the structures. The red dashed line indicates the shift of the reflectance peak. (e) Colour evolutions of the selected colour squares upon hydrogen exposure over time ln(t). The grey-dashed lines indicate the colour vanishing times in the two cases.</figDesc></figure>

It illustrates that smaller interparticle distances are associated with richer colour changes over time, exhibiting a dynamic transition from yellow, red, blue, colour fading to complete colour erasing. In contrast, larger interparticle distances are essentially correlated with a blue colour diminishing process. Interestingly, the erasing times for different colour squares are nearly identical (see the vertical grey-dashed line). The bottom figure in Fig.1epresents the evolution of the colour squares, in which the Mg particles have the same interparticle distance but different sizes. The erasing times differ significantly for different colour squares as indicated by the slanted grey-dashed line. Evidently, colour squares that contain smaller Mg particles vanish faster than those composed of larger particles. This elucidates clear size-dependent hydrogenation kinetics of the Mg nanoparticles.</figDesc><table /></figure>
