<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The first significant buildup in atmospheric oxygen, the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), began in the early Paleoproterozoic in association with global glaciations and continued until the end of the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion ca. 2,060 Ma. The exact timing of and relationships among these events are debated because of poor age constraints and contradictory stratigraphic correlations. Here, we show that the first Paleoproterozoic global glaciation and the onset of the GOE occurred between ca. 2,460 and 2,426 Ma, ∼100 My earlier than previously estimated, based on an age of 2,426 ± 3 Ma for Ongeluk Formation magmatism from the Kaapvaal Craton of southern Africa. This age helps define a key paleomagnetic pole that positions the Kaapvaal Craton at equatorial latitudes of 11°± 6°at this time. Furthermore, the rise of atmospheric oxygen was not monotonic, but was instead characterized by oscillations, which together with climatic instabilities may have continued over the next ∼200 My until ≤2,250-2,240 Ma. Ongeluk Formation volcanism at ca. 2,426 Ma was part of a large igneous province (LIP) and represents a waning stage in the emplacement of several temporally discrete LIPs across a large low-latitude continental landmass. These LIPs played critical, albeit complex, roles in the rise of oxygen and in both initiating and terminating global glaciations. This series of events invites comparison with the Neoproterozoic oxygen increase and Sturtian Snowball Earth glaciation, which accompanied emplacement of LIPs across supercontinent Rodinia, also positioned at low latitude.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Great Oxidation Event | Snowball Earth | Paleoproterozoic | Kaapvaal Craton | Transvaal Supergroup</formula><p>T he early Paleoproterozoic is characterized by dramatic changes in Earth's atmosphere and oceans, with the transition from anoxic to oxic conditions commonly referred to as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. It is generally thought that the onset of the GOE was a singular event <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, an assumption rooted in the perceived bistability of atmospheric oxygen (3). However, this inferred bistability in oxygen was challenged through additional modeling (4), allowing for multiple oscillations in atmospheric oxygen during the onset of the GOE. Geological evidence has also established that this transition was broadly coincident with emplacement of numerous large igneous provinces (LIPs) (5) on extensive continental landmasses positioned at low latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and glaciations interpreted to reflect global Snowball Earth conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Models linking these events have been hampered, however, by uncertainties in local and global stratigraphic correlations and age constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Evidence from the Huronian Supergroup on the Superior Craton in Canada, which hosts three Paleoproterozoic glacial intervals, indicates that the GOE is bracketed in age between ca. 2,460 and 2,308 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. New observations from the critical Transvaal Supergroup in southern Africa indicate that the GOE may have occurred by ca. 2,310 Ma (9) but requires a fourth glaciation at ≤2,250-2,240 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> before the development of the oldest widely accepted oxygenated paleosols <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and red-bed sandstones <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Discrepancies in correlations between these glacially influenced stratigraphic successions and the age of the GOE hinge on a disputed age for the Ongeluk Formation basalts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. By using high-resolution in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on microbaddeleyite grains coupled with precise isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) and paleomagnetic studies, we resolve these uncertainties by obtaining accurate and precise ages for the volcanic Ongeluk Formation and related intrusions in South Africa. These ages lead to a more coherent global perspective on the timing and tempo of the GOE and associated global glaciations and LIPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transvaal Supergroup</head><p>The Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic Transvaal Supergroup overlies the Kaapvaal Craton and is preserved in two main subbasins. In the Griqualand West subbasin, the Makganyene Formation consists of a series of glaciomarine diamictites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Paleomagnetic data for the Ongeluk Formation, which conformably overlies and interfingers with the Makganyene Formation, indicate that these glacial sedimentary rocks were deposited at low latitude, implying a glacial event of global extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>. The age of the Ongeluk Formation basalts has long been accepted at 2,222 ± 13 Ma based on a whole-rock Pb-Pb isochron date <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and correlation with the noncontiguous basalts of the ≤2,250-2,240 Ma Hekpoort Formation in the Transvaal subbasin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, although this correlation has been questioned recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. The Ongeluk Formation is overlain by banded iron and manganese deposits of the Hotazel Formation, which in turn, are followed by carbonate rocks of the Mooidraai Formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Pb-Pb and U-Pb dating of the Mooidraai Formation carbonates has yielded dates of 2,394 ± 26 and 2,392 ± 23 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>, respectively, in conflict with the 2,222 ± 13 Ma Pb-Pb date on the stratigraphically</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p>We present U-Pb ages for the extensive Ongeluk large igneous province, a large-scale magmatic event that took place near the equator in the Paleoproterozoic Transvaal basin of southern Africa at ca. 2,426 Ma. This magmatism also dates the oldest Paleoproterozoic global glaciation and the onset of significant atmospheric oxygenation. This result forces a significant reinterpretation of the iconic Transvaal basin stratigraphy and implies that the oxygenation involved several oscillations in oxygen levels across 10 -5 present atmospheric levels before the irreversible oxygenation of the atmosphere. Data also indicate that the Paleoproterozoic glaciations and oxygenation were ushered in by assembly of a large continental mass, extensive magmatism, and continental migration to near-equatorial latitudes, mirroring a similar chain of events in the Neoproterozoic.</p><p>lower Ongeluk Formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The Hotazel Formation hosts giant Mn deposits with a negative Ce anomaly that are unequivocally interpreted to reflect deposition after the onset of the GOE (7, 21), whereas the Koegas Subgroup underlying the Makganyene Formation contains detrital pyrite and uraninite grains signifying deposition before the GOE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. In the Transvaal subbasin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the start of the GOE has been placed in the middle of either the Duitschland Formation or the Rooihoogte Formation by different authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, with the age of the upper Duitschland Formation constrained by detrital zircon to ≤2,424 ± 24 Ma (11). A 2,316 ± 7 Ma Re-Os age for diagenetic pyrite (25) and a 2,309 ± 9 Ma U-Pb age for tuff in the lower Timeball Hill Formation (9), which conformably overlies the Rooihoogte Formation, suggest that the GOE began by ca. 2,309 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. All chronological and redox records for the Transvaal Supergroup are provided in Tables <ref type="table">S1</ref> and<ref type="table">S2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling</head><p>To test and resolve some of these critical correlations, we have dated by U-Pb isotopic methods a number of dolerite and basalt samples that are linked geologically and paleomagnetically to the Ongeluk Formation basalts (SI Methods, Sampling, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). An N-trending dolerite dike from the Griqualand West subbasin (G02-B) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) (26) as well as an intrusive dolerite sheet from the southeastern Kaapvaal Craton (NL-13c) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> were dated using U-Pb ID-TIMS on baddeleyite. Samples TGS-05 and OLL-2, a coarse-grained, thick basalt flow and a dolerite sill, respectively, from near the base of the Ongeluk Formation basalts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) (6) were dated by in situ U-Pb SIMS on microbaddeleyite grains. To couple geochronological and paleomagnetic records for these mafic units, complementary paleomagnetic studies were conducted on specimens from the TGS-05 and MDK-05 sample sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) using conventional demagnetization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Samples G02-B and NL-13c produce upper intercept baddeleyite dates of 2,421 ± 3 and 2,423 ± 7 Ma, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, SI Methods, Geochronology-ID-TIMS Analysis, Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), whereas samples TGS-05 and OLL-2 yield upper intercept dates of 2,424 ± 32 and 2,397 ± 22 Ma, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, SI Methods, Geochronology-SIMS Analysis, Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). The upper intercept dates of 2,424 ± 32, 2,423 ± 7, and 2,421 ± 3 Ma are interpreted as reliable crystallization ages and overlap within 2σ uncertainty, whereas the date obtained from OLL-2 is likely affected by a minor contribution of secondary zircon as  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. A selection of previously published ages is schematically shown (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) along with redox indicators and ranges of carbon isotope values in carbonates (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). The redox records within the two subbasins tracks the rhythm of GOE and reflects at least two O 2 oscillations back through 10 -5 PAL after the onset of GOE (bold pink arrows and variable intensity pink background shading). Redox indicators requiring more detailed studies are denoted with question marks. All ages are quoted at 2σ uncertainty.</p><p>indicated by SEM imaging. We, therefore, interpret the 2,397 ± 22 Ma date of OLL-2 as a minimum age. In support of this interpretation, one baddeleyite grain (spot F861b) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) yielded a 207 Pb/ 206 Pb date of 2,421 ± 22 Ma.</p><p>A structurally corrected virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) for the dated sample TGS-05 is located at -0.7°N and 288.2°E, whereas the VGP of sample MDK-05 is located at -0.9°N and 283.7°E (SI Methods, Paleomagnetism, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>). Samples OLL-2, G02-B, and NL-13c already have published shallow magnetization directions similar to those reported for the Ongeluk Formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The Ongeluk LIP. All samples were collected stratigraphically from within or below the lower Ongeluk Formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and represent either the feeder system of dolerite dikes and sills to the Ongeluk Formation basalts or coarse-grained interiors of thicker basalt flows. We interpret the Westerberg Sill Province and the N-trending dolerite dike swarm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), both intruding into the Griqualand West subbasin stratigraphy, as parts of the same shortlived magmatic event based on their temporal, spatial, and stratigraphic proximities and similar paleomagnetic results. The age of the Westerberg Sill itself was defined by an upper intercept date of 2,441 ± 6 Ma composed of five discordant baddeleyite analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. However, excluding the most discordant analysis from this result yields a more probable upper intercept date of 2,428 ± 4 Ma. This reinterpretation is supported by concordant baddeleyite analyses from a second sill dated at 2,426 ± 1 Ma as part of the same study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Combining all of these dates, we calculate a weighted mean date of 2,425.5 ± 2.6 Ma (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) as the age of a single relatively short-lived magmatic event, which is now clearly distinguished from ≤2,250-2,240 Ma Hekpoort Formation volcanism with which it was previously correlated. Because sample NL-13c is located ∼1,000 km to the east of the other sample sites, our results indicate a defined craton-scale LIP, the Ongeluk LIP.</p><p>The Ongeluk Key Paleomagnetic Pole. The VGPs presented in this study overlap with previously published paleopoles for the Ongeluk Formation and associated intrusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Collectively, the combined VGPs from all of these studies for the basalts from the Ongeluk Formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and their intrusive feeders (26-28) define a grand key paleomagnetic pole for the Ongeluk LIP that is nearequatorial (29) at 4.1°N, 282.9°E (Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>), with an A 95 of 5.3°t hat achieves five of seven on the quality scale by Van der Voo <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</p><p>Revising the Transvaal Supergroup Stratigraphy. The age for Ongeluk Formation volcanism demands the revision of stratigraphic correlations between the successions of the Griqualand West and Transvaal subbasins of the Transvaal Supergroup (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Previous studies have correlated the Postmasburg and Pretoria Groups using the 2,222 ± 13 Ma Ongeluk Formation and the ≤2,250-2,240 Ma Hekpoort Formation volcanic rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. This correlation is now shown to be incorrect based on the 2,426 ± 3 Ma age constraint provided by the Ongeluk Formation volcanic rocks and associated intrusions. In addition, lithologic and chemostratigraphic data for the Duitschland and Rooihoogte formations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref> coupled with recent age constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref> and arguments relying on basin architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> indicate that the Duitschland and Rooihoogte formations are younger than the Postmasburg Group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A more complete discussion on the Transvaal Supergroup stratigraphy and the proposed revisions is provided in the stratigraphic synthesis (SI Methods, Stratigraphic Synthesis).</p><p>Atmospheric Oxygen Oscillations. This stratigraphic interpretation indicates a dynamic state of atmospheric oxygen levels during the early Paleoproterozoic glacial period. The onset of the GOE occurred in the immediate aftermath of the Makganyene Formation glaciation with deposition of the world's largest manganese deposit, the Hotazel Formation, with a negative Ce anomaly, both indicative of oxygenation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. This oxygenation was followed by a return to anoxic atmospheric conditions as indicated by the lack of a Ce anomaly in foreslope carbonates of the Mooidraai Formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) (21, 32) and a mass-independent fractionation of sulfur (MIF-S) signal recorded by early diagenetic sulfides from the lower Duitschland Formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Subsequent oxygenation events occurred during deposition of the upper Duitschland Formation ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and once again, in the middle of the Rooihoogte Formation (24) as indicated by the reappearance and disappearance of the MIF-S signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Detrital pyrite grains persist above the oldest glacial diamictite in the Mississagi Formation in the Huronian Supergroup of the Superior Craton, Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> and support oscillations in atmospheric oxygen herein inferred from the records of the Transvaal Supergroup (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Our geochronologic and stratigraphic framework argues against a simple, monotonic rise of atmospheric oxygen in the early Paleoproterozoic, a time period further characterized by four glaciations. Instead, the onset of the GOE was followed by oscillations in atmospheric oxygen content across the 10 -5 present atmospheric level (PAL) threshold over an ∼200-My interval, adding empirical evidence to atmospheric modeling predictions (4).</p><p>Linking Snowball Earth and the GOE. The Makganyene Formation, deposited in the tropics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, records the oldest known Snowball Earth event <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Makganyene Formation diamictites are now constrained to be slightly older than ca. 2,426 Ma and likely correlate with glacial units of the Ramsay Lake Formation in the Huronian Supergroup, Canada and the Campbell Lake Formation from the Snowy Pass Supergroup on the Wyoming Craton in the United States. Other correlative glacial units worldwide include the ca. 2,435 Ma Polisarka Formation on the Kola-Karelia Craton in Fennoscandia <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> as well as possibly, the Meteorite Bore Member on the Pilbara Craton in Australia, defining the wide extent of the oldest Paleoproterozoic glaciation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). This early Paleoproterozoic glaciation is broadly coeval with the onset of the GOE; both events are now tightly bracketed between ca. 2,460 Ma, the age of volcanic rocks near the base of the Huronian Supergroup (8, 10), and ca. 2,426 Ma, the approximate age of the Makganyene Formation glaciation and near-coeval Ongeluk Formation volcanic rocks in the Transvaal Supergroup. In addition, the 2,442 ± 2 Ma Seidorechka Formation and the overlying 2,435 ± 2 Ma Polisarka formations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref> overlying the Kola-Karelia Craton may tightly bracket the oldest Paleoproterozoic glacial event between ca. 2,442 Ma and 2,435 Ma, respectively, implying that it lasted less than 7 My (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>Our results add to the growing evidence for large low-latitude continental landmasses in the early Paleoproterozoic, including Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

Shown is a comparison of upper intercept dates with 2σ uncertainties (red columns) from five samples of the Ongeluk LIP, including the Westerberg Sill Province (samples TGS-01 and M03WA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, with a calculated weighted mean age of 2,425.5 ± 2.6 Ma (green bar). The result from a single analysis spot (F861b in OLL-2) is shown for comparison (blue column) (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</p><p>the Kaapvaal Craton (6) and the clan of cratons that defines supercraton Superia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>: Superior, Wyoming, Hearne, and Karelia-Kola. These landmasses, at least in part contiguous, record a series of LIP events between 2,510 Ma and 2,440 Ma and include the Mistassini, Kaminak, Baltic, Baggot Rocks, and Matachewan LIPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) (5) before the ca. 2,426 Ma Ongeluk LIP of the Kaapvaal Craton. Cumulatively, these large juvenile volcanic provinces on extensive low-latitude continental landmasses are likely to have triggered near-equatorial glaciations via enhanced chemical weathering of aerially extensive, nutrient-rich continental flood basalts. This weathering resulted in increased carbon dioxide drawdown <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref> and an enhanced flux of phosphorus and other essential nutrients (40) onto extensive continental margins and into intracratonic basins. An enhanced nutrient flux would have greatly increased photosynthetic activity and oxygen production, temporally linked to higher net burial of organic carbon in accumulating sediments, as reflected by δ 13 C values of carbonates in the upper Tongwane Formation of the Transvaal Supergroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. The Tongwane Formation is locally preserved above the ca. 2,480-2,460 Ma iron formations (41) but below the major unconformity documented in the entire Transvaal basin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Thus, even an incipient rise of free atmospheric oxygen would have led to rapid oxidation of atmospheric methane <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, forcing catastrophic climate change and plunging Earth into a global glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. Importantly, the dated near-equatorial Ongeluk LIP, conformably overlying and interfingering with the uppermost Makganyene Formation glacial diamictites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), illustrates the dual role of LIPs in these global events, in that they would also have contributed carbon dioxide to rebuilding the greenhouse atmosphere that led to abrupt termination of the first Snowball Earth state of the early Paleoproterozoic.  <ref type="table">S1</ref>) of the glaciations and atmospheric oxygen oscillations according to the related redox indicators in the Huronian and Transvaal basins (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) using the same symbols as used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Also shown are dated mafic and felsic magmatic events as well as δ 13 C ranges for carbonates (Tables <ref type="table">S1</ref> and<ref type="table">S2</ref>) and the extent of stratigraphic records in each basin denoting gaps in records at unconformities and disconformities. (B) The early Paleoproterozoic geography of the Superior, Kola-Karelia, Hearne, and Wyoming cratons as integral parts of the supercraton Superia (5, 36)* with the addition of the Kaapvaal and Pilbara cratons in the supercraton Vaalbara configuration <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. The early Paleoproterozoic basins developed on these cratonic fragments include both ca. 2.51-2.43 Ga volcanic rocks and glacial units, which can be correlated across the cratons. The glacial units in bold denote the glacial deposits likely recording the first glaciation. All of the cratonic fragments also contain dolerite dikes and sills emplaced between ca. 2.51 Ga and 2.43 Ga, showing the extent of the LIPs formed during this time. Available paleomagnetic studies indicate that the majority of the cratonic fragments (as part of supercraton Superia) were positioned near the paleoequator. The arrows denoting present-day true north in the crustal blocks illustrate the rotations necessary to make the reconstruction. (Inset) The hypothesized paleolatitude of these Archean cratons in the early Paleoproterozoic.</p><p>Comparing the Paleoproterozoic with the Neoproterozoic. In the Neoproterozoic, a remarkably similar sequence of events occurred, involving successive emplacement of multiple LIPs on the supercontinent Rodinia, a low-latitude position of this supercontinent, and incipient rifting and breakup <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. The massive Franklin LIP at ca. 717 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> immediately preceded the most dramatic and longest global glaciation of the Neoproterozoic, the Sturtian <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. This overall period is characterized by the second most dramatic change in surface redox conditions linked with Snowball Earth glaciations (47) and accompanied high rates of organic carbon burial <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref>. Although substantial differences between the Paleo-and Neoproterozoic glacial periods might be expected, for instance, in the triggering mechanisms for the initial global glaciations, because methane was probably a more important greenhouse gas before the Makganyene glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref> than before the Sturtian glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>, there are also uncanny parallels. Examples include supercraton-or supercontinent-size continental landmasses that were capped by continental flood basalts, incipient rifting and/or breakup, and rapid transit to low latitudes. All of these factors enhanced chemical weathering of juvenile basaltic material and greatly increased the flux of biolimiting nutrients to depositional basins, thus leading to a biotic response of higher organic carbon burial <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref> as well as deposition of giant iron and manganese deposits. It seems likely that these similar scenarios are not coincidental but that the critical factors (assembly of large landmasses, LIPs, incipient rifting, and relief enhancement-all resulting in a lithospheric mass anomaly and movement to low latitudes, high rates of organic carbon burial, surface oxygenation, and Snowball Earth glaciations) are mechanistically linked. In this case, a critical link might be true polar wander caused by the lithospheric mass anomaly that nudged the basalt-covered and rifting supercontinental landmasses to the equator <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>, where chemical weathering and nutrient fluxes kicked into high gear and triggered the biotic, redox, and climatic responses.</p></div>

Samples in this study were taken from dolerite intrusions that intruded into the basement of the Kaapvaal Craton and the overlying cover succession of the Transvaal Supergroup in the Griqualand West subbasin, South Africa, except for one sample taken ∼1,000 km to the east (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, SI Methods, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).
