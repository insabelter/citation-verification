<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>How to improve the teaching management model has always been an important part of the research and exploration of university music teaching management. Based on the random matrix network theory, this paper builds a random matrix network model and uses the random matrix network of Internet/Intranet to realize the electronic and networked multimedia information management, which makes the data query more flexible and convenient. In the random matrix network environment, the security of the model network is greatly improved, which solves the expansion problem of the random matrix network. During the simulation process, the model integrates the relevant image, audio, video, animation, and other multimedia processing technologies and storage technologies. *e system adopts object-oriented analysis and design ideas to analyze the requirements, adopts the random matrix network architecture, and uses tomcat as the server, and the SQL Server database launched by Microsoft is used as the backend data support, and the Struts architecture is designed by using the MVC development mode to ensure the system has good maintainability and enhanced data processing capabilities. *e experimental results show that the response time of the system login verification is less than 2 seconds, the response time of adding users is less than 2 seconds, the response time of downloading assignments is less than 2 seconds, the response time of uploading courseware is less than 3 seconds, and the response time of checking the results is less than 2 seconds. *e separation of technology effectively improves the scalability and maintainability of the system.</p></div>

A set of data can be replicated to multiple mobile disconnected users, allowing those users to work autonomously. In addition, the use of this system will play a significant part in promoting school teaching reform, improving students' autonomy in learning and reducing teachers' workload.</p></div>

From the point of view of control theory, Wang et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> research on stochastic systems mainly includes modeling and identification (that is, establishing a mathematical model or estimating the parameters of the model based on measurement data), filtering (that is, estimating noise affected by noise based on measurement data and system model), performance analysis such as stability and observability, stochastic control (designing a controller for the system to minimize some specific performance indicators), stochastic adaptive control (combining system identification and control), and so on. In the requirement analysis and acquisition stage of the system, it is mainly to give an overall overview of the development of the system, clarify the development direction of the system, and then divide the system into three major functional modules according to the acquired requirements, clarify the role of each user, and provide a detailed understanding of the system. *e design aspects of the research provide the corresponding basis. *e wide application range of stochastic systems reflects the importance of research on the basic issues of control theory for stochastic systems.</p><p>When using random matrix theory to analyze problems, sometimes it is necessary to the influence of a single state variable on the whole. In this case, an augmented matrix construction method with increased weights can be used. Guerrero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> introduced and analyzed the feasibility of the music teaching system from the aspects of operational feasibility, economic feasibility, and technical feasibility.

For areas with coarse texture, the P(i, j) values in the gray level co-occurrence matrix are more concentrated near the main diagonal because for coarse textures, pairs of pixels tend to have the same grayscale.

In addition, system management includes basic information management in education and teaching management, mainly including adding, modifying, deleting, and querying basic information such as departments, majors, and so on, which is the basic module used by system administrators. *e department, class, and data dictionary information of the college music education teaching system are described.</p><p>*e main user role of system management is the administrator of the system shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, which has the right to add, delete, and modify specific basic information. *e system adopts unified identity authentication. When users log in to the system with different identities, they can only see the functions corresponding to the identities. *e main window of the system provides users with five functions to choose from: class management, student file management, course management, and grade management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Network Teaching Data Flow</head><p>. *e operation of network teaching data files is mainly realized through the FILEINFO class. In FILEINFO, there are methods, such as create, copy to , delete, and move to, to realize the creation, copying, moving, deleting, and other operations of files, and the FILEINFO class provides a lot of methods to get file attributes, such as existing name and so on. ASP-NET operates on folders mainly through the directoryinfo class, which has many of the same methods and properties as fileinfo. Many operations on folders are easily accomplished through directoryinfo. Also, it can use filestream class and GZIPstream class to realize the online compression and decompression function of the file in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Student file management function mainly realizes the management of personal information of university students, including the modification of personal information by students, the management of files by teachers in the academic affairs office, and the management of student status by teachers in the academic affairs office, so as to facilitate the university management department to quickly understand the basic situation of the school.</p><p>Because the physical meaning and value range of each component are different, they need to be internally normalized, so that each component can have the same weight when calculating the similarity distance. *e integrated result is returned to the user's browser, and the user directly operates the feedback data for viewing, browsing, and processing.</p><p>*e system adopts the multilayer architecture design mode of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>. In order to reduce the load pressure on the server side, the system uses two servers, one of which is used as a dedicated database access server, and the other is used as a web deployment server. In the design of the system management class diagram structure, the system management interface class diagram object is provided, which includes different subordinate objects such as the user management interface class, the role management interface class, and the menu management interface class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Music Network Topology Architecture</head><p>. *e multimedia management system mainly realizes the browsing of music network topology files, the retrieval of multimedia files, the statistics of multimedia files, the upload of multimedia files, the registration of users, the management of data, and the management of systems. *at is, for a given reference to a base class (or interface), the consuming object has no way of knowing whether a derived class (or implementing class) exists. In order to utilize the information of the gray level direction, interval, and variation range of the image provided by the gray level co-occurrence matrix, the first-order and second-order statistics are calculated on the basis of the co-occurrence matrix as its texture features. Based on these numerical statistics, quantitative description and matching retrieval of texture features of images can be performed. So,   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>all these derived classes (or implementation classes) are interchangeable, thus encapsulating the type nicely.</p><p>When the mode of the system tends to infinity, the calculation of the performance index of the system in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> is simplified, thus reducing the computational complexity; the method of asymptotic analysis makes the calculation of the performance index no longer depend on the specific channel matrix. Specifically, in most cases, the asymptotic analysis method based on stochastic theory guarantees that the empirical singular value distribution of the channel matrix H has the following important characteristics that are very convenient for analyzing wireless channels when satisfied.</p><p>*e Gaussian normalization method is a better normalization method, which is characterized by a small number of super large or super small element values that have little effect on the distribution of the entire normalized element value. *e purpose of this design is to better communicate with the front and back offices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Module Feasibility Analysis</head><p>. *e course management module sets the courses of each class in the university. *e course management module can set the selection of teaching materials for each course of music and art teaching, which facilitates the work of the teaching management personnel of the teaching materials management department and the academic affairs office of the university. *is module includes functions such as curriculum development, initialization of classroom resources, and class selection. During the course information query process, select the course information to be deleted in the course list and send a deletion request. *e system receives the primary key of the course to be deleted and prompts the deletion result according to whether the operation is successful. *is development mode greatly reduces the load on the client computer programmatically and at the same time reduces the tasks and costs caused by the later maintenance and upgrade of the system. With this mode, users can enter and modify their own information so that other authorized persons can easily view and share the various information shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>.</p><p>In the process of uploading multimedia data, AJAX is widely used. When selecting a file, the system will asynchronously obtain the attributes of the file and other related attributes, so that some search information can be accurately counted in the background without user participation, which can not only improve the information but also improve the efficiency of adding information and the user experience.</p><p>Here, one person is set as the system administrator, and the information technology teacher is the teacher. Because the information technology teacher is familiar with the use of the database system and the teaching structure, it is the most suitable. If these two controls are used alone, it cannot be achieved. *is is a bug of VS. In this way, the only way to change the code of the AJAX control is to make it compatible with the file upload control.</p></div>

Music Data Preprocessing. Music data design adopts the three-level management mechanism of resources, roles, and users, flexibly assigns roles to users, and assigns accessible resources to roles, so that the permissions of users can be configured. *e roles used by the system are stored in the role table. For example, in the multimedia information management system of colleges and universities, the users of the system include system developers, school administrators, teachers, students, learning media teachers, and so on, and each has its own authority. *ese approximate expressions are usually relatively simple and can lead to corresponding conclusions for the characteristic parameters of most interest in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>.</p><p>After the user is registered, if the user information changes, such as the user's contact information, the department to which the user belongs, and the user's responsibilities and permissions, the administrator or user with the user's modification authority can be allowed to modify the user information.

According to the characteristics of the users of the system, the design of the music education and teaching system in universities adopts the framework development mode of JSP technology, random matrix and C/S combination, JDBC connection database, and Struts technology implementation. *e C/S structure is used for the course arrangement management part of the music education and teaching system in universities, which has relatively centralized management and complex interaction; the relatively mature and stable opensource MVC framework Struts separates display, control, and business logic, improving the maintainability and scalability of the music education and teaching system in universities.</p><p>In this management system, the system administrator has the greatest authority. *e system information includes the user management part. Since there are many modules in the multimedia information management system in universities, a single test is definitely not feasible. *is paper uses N unit software to test. *e following explains how to use it to test the modules of the multimedia information management system in universities.</p><p>*e data flow in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> is a form of expressing the work of the data processing system through the two aspects of data and data processing. *is description can be more easily understood by designers, developers, and users. Struts is a framework technology based on the MVC pattern. Struts ActionServlet controls the navigation flow. It is a web-tier application framework that is highly configurable and has an ever-growing list of features. In the design process of functional modules, four different functional modules are designed according to three different user roles and their functional requirements. In the aspect of database design in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, it mainly starts from the two aspects of logical structure and physical structure design.</p><p>*e classes that complete the management functions of student files in student file management include the student file management control class StudentsArchivesAction, the student file management business logic class Stu-dentsArchivesService, the student file management entity class StudentsArchivesBean, the student file management form class StudentsArchivesForm, and the database connection class ConnDS. *e student file management control class StudentsArchivesAction mainly includes the definition of methods in student file management, such as adding file method executeAddFiles0, managing student status man-agementStatus0, managing basic information method   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Example Application and Analysis.</head><p>Course management is an indispensable functional module in the music teaching and education management system in universities. *e main functions involved in the core functional modules will be implemented through the class management control class ClassAction, the class management business logic class ClassService, the class management form class ClassForm, and the class management entity class. After the user enters the new class data, the request is sent by submitting, the class management control class ClassAction calls the class management business logic class ClassService to add the class method, the parameters in the class management form class ClassForm are encapsulated with the class management entity class ClassBean, and the statement is added through the new class in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>.</p><p>*e student file management control class in the system receives the student status data in the form and determines whether the same record exists in the database. *e system class control class receives user query conditions and queries the database for corresponding class information. After the query, it is judged whether there is a corresponding record, and the page displays the class query result.</p><p>*e main classes in the achievement management include the achievement management control class ResultAction, the achievement management business logic class ResultService, the achievement management entity class ResultBean, the achievement management form class ResultForm, and the database connection class ConnDS. *e grade management control class CourseAction defines a number of grade management related methods, such as the method for setting the test type setExamType0, the method for checking grades checkGrades0, the method for initializing transcripts, ini-tializationTranscript, and the method for summarizing grades, summaryResults, and so on. When the system is used by 200 users at the same time, the server CPU usage is less than 65%, the memory usage is less than 60%, the login verification response time is less than 2 seconds, the response time for adding users is less than 2 seconds, the download job response time is less than 2 seconds, the response time for uploading courseware is less than 3 seconds, and the response time for viewing results is less than 2 seconds. *e experiment uses LoadRunner to simulate the scenarios of 200 users online and 300 users at the same time through the simulator (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>). When adding a new student status, after the clerk fills in the new student status, the page will use JavaScript to verify the page form data. After the student status information is in the correct format, a new request will be sent. *e student file management control class of the system receives the student status data in the form and determines whether the same record exists in the database. If there is, it needs to be filled in again; otherwise, the corresponding data in the form are saved to the data, and the result of the operation result of adding student The design value of the database of the network  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>status information returns the value display page, and it is to add request for student status information. *e information does not match and needs to be filled in again, bringing a better user experience to teachers or students. Operating permissions are set, and the corresponding permissions can only view or download multimedia resources of the corresponding level. Because the physical meaning and value range of each component are different, they need to be internally normalized, so that each component can have the same weight when calculating the similarity distance. Various types of information can be added, modified, deleted, etc., so that specific functions can be implemented in one window, simplifying the system and making user operations more convenient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In the development process of this paper, the random matrix technology is applied to the management of music education. Based on the hierarchical structure of random matrix network, the informatization of music education and teaching management is realized, which has a positive significance for the construction of university informatization. *is system uses the principle of software engineering and completes the management system of music education and teaching through the analysis of random matrix system requirements, system design and detailed design, and system testing. *e random matrix-assisted teaching management system is divided into three types of user roles, and the system administrator is mainly responsible for managing basic information; for teachers, its functions include personal information management, courseware management, homework management, homework review, and grade management; for students, its functions include personal information management, courseware management, homework management, and grade query. It is a relatively scientific approach to let users register, which allows the administrator to easily collect some information and make some accurate judgments on the application of the system, but it is necessary to improve the user registration process. *e development process of the music education teaching management system is carried out in strict accordance with the steps, and in the whole process of system research, analysis, and design of the system, it strives to be scientific and rational. *e teaching management function implemented in the random matrix system has a friendly interface, relatively complete functions, convenient and quick use, and is safe and efficient.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :Figure 3 :</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Music hierarchy architecture.</figDesc></figure>
