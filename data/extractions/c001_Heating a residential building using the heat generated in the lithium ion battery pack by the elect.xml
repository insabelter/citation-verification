<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article simulates the cooling of three packs of lithium-ion batteries using airflow in a ventilation channel. Battery packs include 12 cell batteries. Air heated by the battery is used to provide some of the energy needed for a two-story residential unit in a cold, dry environment. The energy required for this building is estimated using Design Builder software for different months of the year, and the ability to supply this energy is measured by cooling the batteries. By changing the air velocity in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 m/s and seven arrangements of battery packs in the ventilation channel, the temperature values of the battery cells, the outlet temperature of the channel, etc. are estimated. COMSOL 5.5 Multiphysics software is used to simulate the ventilation channel with battery packs. The results show that the average and optimal temperature of the battery cells can be reduced to 4.14 and 11.01 • C, respectively, by enhancing the air velocity. However, the increment in air velocity reduces the air outlet temperature, so that the minimum reduction is 4.23 • C with doubling the velocity. The designed system can supply up to 74.3% of the energy required for the house (October) from the total energy required for heating. Using this battery cooling system leads to a reduction of the amount of annual energy required by the building using urban energy sources from 17 to 14.2 kWh.</p></div>

Reducing energy consumption in this area can reduce energy consumption in the world. Batteries have found wide applications. One of the most important uses of batteries is to use them to store electricity from solar panels in buildings. Batteries generate considerable heat during charging and discharging, especially at high charging and discharging rates. If you do not cool down and dissipate this heat, the battery will be seriously damaged. Due to these two important challenges mentioned, in this paper, the heat generated by a battery is used to heat a building. For this purpose, the cooling of a lithium-ion battery is first simulated. Then, the heated fluid in the battery is used to heat a building. The battery is cooled and part of the heat required for a building is provided simultaneously. Briefly, the innovation of the present work is the cooling of a battery pack with special geometry and the use of its generated heat as a part of the energy required for a house.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and discussion</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> demonstrates velocity contours for different models of 3 battery packs with 12 battery cells in each pack at a velocity of 0.015 m/s. The air tends to go in a direction with a lower pressure drop. Therefore, the amount of air velocity is higher in parts that there is no battery cell. By changing the location of the battery pack, more air passes through these areas. The lowest maximum velocity is seen in model 1. In this model, due to the placement of the battery pack in the middle of the channel, there is a large space for air to pass on either side of the channel. Hence, the amount of air velocity is also increased less. In other models, due to the absence of battery cells, the maximum velocity is close to each other. In models 2 and 3, which have two primary and last battery packs on one side and a middle battery pack on the other side, the maximum velocity is also higher. The first and the last pack of batteries have a greater impact on the maximum velocity than the original pack as well as the direction where the highest air velocity occurs. The velocity values among the battery cells in the first pack of the battery are higher than the other two packs. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>. shows airflow path lines for different models of 3 battery packs with 12 battery cells in each pack at a velocity of 0.015 m/s. Model 1 has streamlines with a temperature symmetrical to the horizontal midline of the ventilation channel. This model has a symmetrical flow due to its geometric symmetry. In other models, the amount of flow passing through one side of the ventilation channel is always higher, leading to that the amount of fluid temperature in this area is lower. The passage of more fluid in this area means faster airflow, which reduces the time for heat exchange in this area and therefore the temperature is lower. The maximum air temperature always occurs in the middle of the ventilation channel. The temperature is higher in this area due to the passage of air between the battery cells and heat transfer with the battery cells. This area has a lower velocity due to more pressure drop and has more time to exchange heat with the battery cells. There are two high vortices in the entrance corners of the air channel and two small Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>.

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>. depicts isothermal lines for different models of 3 battery packs with 12 battery cells in each pack at a velocity of 0.01 and 0.02 m/s. In the first model, it can be seen that the isotherms are symmetric for both velocities. But, in other models of battery packs, one side of the channel is warmer than the other side. More airflow from one side of the channel compared to the other sides causes this issue. The batteries in the middle of the battery pack are at a higher temperature than the side batteries. The air velocity at the sides of the channel is higher, which makes the batteries have lower temperatures in those areas. Also, the first pack of batteries is at a lower temperature than the other two packs. The outlet- </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>side packs have the hottest batteries. The batteries laced in the first pack have a lower temperature than the other two packs due to contact with air. The last pack is warmer due to contact with air at higher temperatures (air is at the temperature of previous batteries). The increase in air velocity in the channel causes the temperature of the batteries in the battery packs to decrease. Air velocity causes the air to be in the channel in less time and as a result, its temperature in each section of the channel is less than the low-velocity case. Thus, it can exchange heat efficiently with the battery cells and cool the batteries. Besides, the increase in air velocity causes the battery cells in a battery pack to have a closer temperature to each other and the temperature of the middle batteries to be closer to the side batteries.   Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">8</ref>. depicts the maximum temperature on 36 battery cells for three different velocities and different models of three battery packs. The maximum battery cell temperature occurs on the middle batteries of the pack at the outlet side of the channel for all cases. These batteries are at a higher temperature than other battery cells due to the passage of airflow with a lower velocity and higher temperature. An enhancement in the air velocity causes the maximum temperature to be lower than the average temperature of the battery cells. Increasing the air velocity allows the air to receive more heat from the battery cells and cool them. The highest maximum battery cell temperatures for velocities of 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 m/s correspond to models 2, 3, and 1, respectively. The minimum temperature of the battery cell for velocities of 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 m/s corresponds to models 4, 5, and 3, respectively. The maximum and minimum temperature reduction occurs for model 3 and models 4 and 5, respectively. These values are 11.01 and 10.33 • C.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C</head><p>T E D increment in the air velocity reduces the heat exchange time between the battery and the air in the air channel. Hence, the air remains less next to the battery cells and the cells have less temperature. As a result, the increase in velocity causes the amount of air temperature in the ventilation channel to decrease. The output temperature difference between various models of battery packs at low air velocities is greater than that at high velocities. The maximum air outlet temperature at different velocities corresponds to models 2 and 3, while the minimum outlet air temperature is related to model 1. Enhancing the air velocity from 0.01 to 0.02 m/s causes a slight decrease in the inlet and inlet temperature of the air for models 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively, which is 4.23, 4.98, 4.6, and 4.45 • C. The maximum and minimum temperature reduction corresponds to models 2 and 1, respectively. Therefore, with the doubling of the air velocity in the ventilation channel, the difference between the inlet and outlet air temperature is reduced by less than 50%. Considering the constant heat capacity of the air, more heat can be transferred from the battery packs to the air at higher air velocities. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">10</ref>. demonstrates the heat transfer coefficient on 36 battery cells for three different velocities and different models of three battery packs. Increasing the air velocity slightly enhances the heat transfer coefficient on the battery cells. An increment in the air velocity makes the velocity boundary layer thinner on the battery cell. Therefore, due to the     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C</head><p>T E D Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">12</ref>. depicts the percentage of supply energy from the total energy required by the building for different months of the year at different air velocities in the ventilation channel. It is seen that the higher the air velocity in the channel, the more heat is transferred from the batteries to the air. It can be seen that the use of air with a higher velocity in the ventilation channel, despite the battery packs, causes to receive a greater amount of energy required from the battery packs. In the cold seasons, the percentage of supply energy by cooling the batteries from the total energy is reduced due to the higher need of the building for heating energy. The supplied energy from batteries is constant in different months and the percentage of supply energy from batteries decreases with the increase of building energy needs. In January and February, the contribution of supply energy from the total energy is minimum and this contribution is maximum in June and October. Also, in summer, the figure does not show a number due to the lack of need for heating energy. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">13</ref>. illustrates the annual heating energy required by the building at different air velocities in the ventilation channel. It can be seen that the annual energy required by the building is usually about 17 kWh. Now, in the presence of the battery packs, the amount of energy required for the home heating system from fossil fuels is reduced by using the ventilation system. This amount of energy can also be reduced by about 14.2 kWh.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This paper simulates the airflow around three lithium-ion battery packs with 12 battery cells in each battery pack in a ventilation channel to heat the building. The air velocity is changed between 0.01 and 0.02 m/s for different models of battery packs, and the values of battery cell temperature, air outlet temperature, heat transfer coefficient, etc. are determined. The results of this study demonstrate:</p><p>1. An increment in the air velocity in the ventilation channel causes the average and maximum temperature values of the battery cells and the air outlet temperature from the channel to decrease.    However, doubling the inlet velocity gives the maximum heat transfer coefficient (105%) for this model. 7. By placing three battery packs in the ventilation channel when air velocity is 0.02 m/s, 74.3% of the supply energy required by the building can be provided in the best condition in October. 8. For air velocities of 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 m/s, the values of 1.4, 2.1, and 2.8 kWh of the annual supply energy required for the building can be obtained from the cooling of the battery packs.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 +Fig. 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

A reduction in battery temperature occurs for all battery pack modes by enhancing the fluid velocity. An enhancement in the air velocity from 0.01 to 0.015 m/s reduces the average temperature. Due to the similarity of the arrangements of packs, the average temperatures of models 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are very close to each other. The minimum average temperatures of battery cells correspond to models 4 and 5, and the maximum one is related to model 1. This is valid for all velocities. It can be seen that an increment in the velocity from 0.01 to 0.02 m/s reduces the temperature of models 4 and 5 by 4 • C, while reducing the temperature of model 1 by 5.14 • C, indicating that an enhancement in the air velocity has a greater impact on model 1.</figDesc></figure>

Also, an enhancement in the air velocity intensifies the amount of temperature difference between the battery and the fluid, especially in the last pack of the battery, leading to an increase in the amount of heat transfer coefficient. Model 1 has the minimum heat transfer coefficient at all velocities. However, this model has the maximum heat transfer coefficient by enhancing the velocity; its value increases by 105% by doubling the velocity. The maximum heat transfer coefficient is different for different velocities. Models 2 and 3 have a maximum heat transfer coefficient for the velocity of 0.01 m/s. Model 2 has a maximum heat transfer coefficient for the velocity of 0.015 m/s and models 4 and 5 have a maximum heat transfer coefficient for the velocity of 0.02 m/s. The lowest heat transfer coefficient corresponds to models 2 and 3 by doubling the velocity, which is by 102%. Fig.11. illustrates the pressure drop in the ventilation channel for three different velocities and different models of three battery packs. Increasing the air velocity between the battery cells enhances the amount of pressure drop. An increment in the air velocity causes the velocity difference in the close layer of the stationary battery cells to increase. The vertical velocity gradient enhances the amount of shear stress on the battery cells. An increment in the shear stresses generally causes an intensification in the pressure drop in the ventilation channel. The amount of pressure drop is the same for different models, and only model 1 has a greater pressure drop than other ones.</figDesc></figure>
