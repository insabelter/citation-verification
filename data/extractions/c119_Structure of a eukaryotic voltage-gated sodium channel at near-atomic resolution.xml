<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are ubiquitously present in eukaryotes and responsible for the initiation of electrical signaling in excitable systems such as nerve and muscle. The Nav channels remain closed at resting potentials and activate upon membrane depolarization, allowing for the Na + influx that corresponds to the rapid upstroke of an action potential. Nav channels inactivate rapidly; meanwhile, the activation of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels resets the membrane electric field to resting state. Defects in Nav channels underlie a variety of neurological and cardiovascular disorders. Over 1,000 mutations have been identified in human Nav channels that are associated with epilepsy, arrhythmia, muscle paralysis, chronic pain, and other syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.

The α subunit is sufficient for voltage-dependent ion conductance, while the β subunits facilitate membrane localization and modulate channel properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. There are 9 isoforms of Nav α subunits in human, designated Nav1.1-Nav1.9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. A sequence related protein, now named NavX, was found to function in salt sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. The α subunit, similar to the closely related Cav channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, is comprised of a single polypeptide chain that folds to four homologous repeats (domains I-IV) each containing six transmembrane segments S1-S6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>). The four sets of S5 and S6 segments and their intervening sequences enclose the ion permeation pore domain, while the S1-S4 segments in each repeat form a voltage sensing domain (VSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. The α subunit is subjected to multiple posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and palmitylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>.

The residues that determine ion selectivity are identical in each protomer in the homotetrameric bacterial channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19)</ref> and in the four homologous repeats of eukaryotic Cav channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21)</ref>.

The inner tetrahelical bundle of the pore domain screws at the cytoplasmic boundary of the membrane, forming the intracellular activation gate. Essential for voltage gating, VSDs contain the "gating charges" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>, which are a set of highly conserved positively charged residues occurring at every third place along S4 segment. Upon depolarization, according to measurements in Kv channels, approximately 12 gating charges per channel are transferred across the membrane from the intracellular side to the extracellular side <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.

However, the S4-S5 helices are missing in the recently resolved structures of Eag1, Slo1, HCN1, and CNG channels whose domains are not swapped, suggesting potentially different electromechanical coupling mechanism for these channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>.</p><p>While the activation mechanism has not been fully understood, at least as bewildering are the intricate inactivation mechanisms for voltage-gated channels.

During prolonged depolarization, slow inactivation takes place by a mechanism that is not well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>, although it is thought at least in some cases that a conformational change of the selectivity filter underlies this process in Nav and Kv channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43)</ref>.</p><p>Detailed atomic model of a eukaryotic Nav channel is required to reveal the molecular basis for ion selectivity, voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, as well as recognition of toxins, agonists and inhibitors.

The recent structural elucidation of the Cav1.1 channel complex provides a more relevant template for homology modeling of Nav channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50)</ref>.</p><p>The bottleneck for structural determination of a eukaryotic Nav channel exists in the generation of sufficient amount of high-quality proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(51)</ref>. Unsuccessful in obtaining homogeneous proteins from either electric eel or mammalian Nav channel preparations, we turned to insect Nav channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(52)</ref>. Similar to their mammalian relatives, the insect Nav channels have single-chain α subunit and auxiliary subunit exemplified by TipE <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>. Among the insect homologs tested, we succeeded in purifying sufficient recombinant proteins for a putative Nav channel from the American cockroach Periplaneta americana <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>. To facilitate description, the protein that was originally named PaFPC1 is designated NavPaS. Here we report the structure of NavPaS at a nominal resolution of 3.8 Å determined using single-particle cryo-EM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural determination of NavPaS</head><p>NavPaS shares 36-43% sequence identities with human Nav1.1-1.9, containing the signature DEKA residues on the selectivity filter and highly conserved transmembrane segments (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). The variations mainly exist in the intracellular linkers between repeats. NavPaS, consisting of 1553 amino acid residues, has considerably shorter I-II and II-III linkers than the mammalian and other insect homologs, whose sequence lengths range between 1800 to 2050 residues. The III-IV linker of NavPaS is of identical length with those of the human channels, but lacks the Ile/Phe/Met/Thr (IFMT) or similar motif that is critical for fast inactivation (55) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>).</p><p>The electrophysiological properties of NavPaS have not been characterized. We attempted to record NavPaS in several expression systems, including HEK293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Xenopus laevis oocytes, in the presence or absence of the β subunits PaTipE and PaTEH1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57)</ref>. Despite that the channel can be expressed on plasma membrane even in the absence of any β subunit (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2A</ref>), no Na + current could be unambiguously assigned to NavPaS in all three tested systems, a problem that is occasionally encountered for heterologously expressed channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56)</ref>. While the physiological function and biophysical properties of NavPaS remain to be investigated, it possesses all the hallmarks of a Nav channel except for the fast inactivation motif and displays good solution behavior (figs. S1 and S2B). We thereby proceeded with structural determination using cryo-EM.</p><p>Details of grid preparation, cryo-EM data acquisition, and structural determination of NavPaS are presented in Supplemental Methods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, and figs. S2 and S3). We selected 1.3 million particles and calculated an EM map to 3.8 Å according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, C and D, and figs. S2, C to G). The EM maps are well resolved for most of the extracellular and transmembrane sequences (figs. S4 and S5). In total 1323 residues are structurally modeled with 1177 side chains assigned, covering the complete voltage-gated ion channel fold, extracellular loops of the pore domain, the intact III-IV linker, and the carboxy terminal domain (CTD). A poly-Ala backbone was built for the amino terminal domain (NTD) containing residues 47-120 that immediately precede the VSD of repeat I (VSDI).</p><p>The missing segments are all on the intracellular side, including the N-terminal 46 amino acids, the I-II linker (residues 436-501) and II-III linker (residues 747-832), and the C-terminal 32 residues. In addition to the polypeptide chain, 20 sugar moieties are built into 7 glycosylation sites on the extracellular loops, namely the L5 loops between S5 and P1 segments and the L6 loops between P2 and S6 segments on February 9, 2017 <ref type="url" target="http://science.sciencemag.org/">http://science.sciencemag.org/</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref> and table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</p><p>The overall structure resembles that of the α1 subunit of the rabbit Cav1.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>. The sequence for NTD, which is located below VSDI and between VSDI and S6I, is conserved in Nav channels and harbors a number of disease-related mutations (50) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref> and figs. S1 and S6). We will refrain from detailed analysis of NTD due to the low resolution for this domain (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2F</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The asymmetric selectivity filter</head><p>In NavPaS, the SF vestibule is enclosed by the side groups of the signature residues Asp375/Glu701/Lys1061/Ala1353 at the upper position and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the two preceding residues in each repeat at lower level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2,  A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Above DEKA, the outer negative ring composed of Glu378/Glu704/Gln1065/Asp1356 guards the entrance to the SF vestibule. In human Nav channels, a conserved Asp in repeat III occupies the position corresponding to Gln1065 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). In EM reconstructions, the densities for the carboxylate groups of Asp and Glu residues are usually invisible due to radiation damage. Fortunately, the backbone and the alkyl groups are discernible for most of the negatively charged residues in SF and the P1 and P2 helices of NavPaS (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>The SF vestibule of a bacterial Nav channel is also composed of side groups for the outer site and eight carbonyl oxygen atoms for the inner site <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45)</ref>. However, the SF vestibule of the eukaryotic Nav channel is distinct from that of the bacterial counterparts with respect to both chemical composition and structural conformation, providing the molecular basis to investigate the different selectivity mechanisms between eukaryotic and bacterial Nav channels (58) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>). The SF sequence in repeat II is one residue shorter than in the other three repeats. Consistently, the backbone conformation of SFII deviates from the other three, further adding to the asymmetry of the SF vestibule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>).</p><p>At current resolution, we refrain from assessment of the precise dimension of the SF vestibule <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(59)</ref> or analysis of the interactions between D/E and K. Nevertheless, the side group of Lys1061 appears to adopt a downward conformation with the amino group pointing away from Asp375 and Glu701 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). The protein for data acquisition was prepared in the presence of 50 mM NaCl. Discontinuous densities are observed in the SF vestibule. However, the relatively weak signal and the slight positional variations between half maps make it difficult to distinguish between the densities of Na + ions and noises (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A closed pore with one small fenestration</head><p>The pore domain of NavPaS is well resolved in the EM re-construction, allowing accurate assignment of side groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref> and figs. S4 and S5). Unexpectedly, the complete extracellular L5 and L6 loops are also resolved, suggesting their structural stability even in the absence of binding partners. Indeed, four pairs of disulfide bonds are identified within the L5I, L5III, and L6IV loops. An additional disulfide bond is found between the P2 helix and S6 in Repeat II (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>). All these disulfide-forming Cys residues are invariant in the human and insect Nav channels (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>).</p><p>The L5 loops in Repeats I and III are particularly long, containing short helices and anti-parallel β-strands. These bulky extracellular structures provide the scaffold for binding with the auxiliary β subunits through covalent or noncovalent interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. A recent characterization identified Cys910 in hNav1.2, a residue on the L5II loop, to be disulfide-bonded with the β2 subunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref>. Despite that the specific Cys is not conserved in NavPaS, the similar length and general sequence conservation of L5II loop between NavPaS and human Nav channels will facilitate structural modeling of complex formation between α and β subunits of Nav channels (figs. S1 and S6).</p><p>Compared to the extracellular loops in Cav1.1 that are involved in the interactions with the α2δ subunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49)</ref>, the L5 and L6 loops of NavPaS have more folded secondary structural elements and are heavily glycosylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, A and B, and fig. <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>). The extracellular loops of NavPaS leave a spacious opening to the outer mouth of the SF vestibule. The surfaces above SF are enriched in negatively charged residues distributed on the L5 loops in Repeats I-III and the L6IV loop, a structural shield that would attract cations and exclude anions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>).</p><p>The S6 tetrahelical bundle encloses a distinctive permeation path that is sealed at the intracellular boundary by two layers of hydrophobic residues Leu, Ile, Val, and Ala (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>). Interestingly, the central cavity between the SF vestibule and the intracellular gate appears to have a smaller volume than that of Cav1.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>. In particular, a number of polar and charged residues line up the wall of the central cavity, including the highly conserved Asn residue (Asn409/Asn729/Lys1105/Asn1404) on each S6 segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure">S7B</ref>).</p><p>Similar to Cav1.1, the four-fold pseudosymmetry of the pore domain is disrupted by the conformational variations of the S5 and S6 segments (fig. <ref type="figure">S7C</ref>). Unexpectedly, only one small pore fenestration is observed on the side constituted by repeats III and IV whereas the other three sides are completely sealed from the lipid bilayer, a conformational state that differs from the structures of prokaryotic Nav channels and Cav1.1, wherein pore fenestrations are present on all four sides <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49)</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3E</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure">S7D</ref>).  <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4A</ref>). The III-IV linker is involved in the fast inactivation gating of Nav channels, with the hydrophobic cluster IFM being a critical motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(61)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(63)</ref>. The solution structure of an isolated III-IV linker and the cryo-EM structure of Cav1.1 both revealed the presence of a short α helix presumably following the IFM motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64)</ref>. However, the residues corresponding to IFM are missing in Cav1.1, preventing modeling of this motif in the context of the overall structure.</p><p>In the reconstruction of NavPaS, the complete III-IV linker is resolved, comprising a helix followed by a long unwound segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The IFM-corresponding residues are 1127Ala/Thr/Asp1129 (ATD) in NavPaS, which are located at a short turn connecting the C terminus of S6III and the III-IV helix (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4B</ref>). In the side view, the ATD and the following III-IV helix are sandwiched between the Cterminal tips of S6III and S6IV, with the ATD motif at similar height to the C-termini of S6III and S6IV, approximately 15 Å away from the lower level of the intracellular gate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4B</ref>). Because the adjacent structural elements, including S4-S5IV, S6III, S6IV, and CTD, are conserved between NavPaS and human Nav channels, the position of ATD may reflect those of the corresponding IFM in the human Nav channels (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). The structure implies that the short linker between the C terminus of S6III and the IFM motif may impede the latter from reaching the intracellular gate unless S6III and S6IV undergo a pronounced conformational rearrangement. Notwithstanding the structural analysis, it remains to be characterized whether NavPaS undergoes fast inactivation.</p><p>The polar interactions along the intracellular surface of repeat IV are extensive, involving the III-IV linker, CTD, VSDIV, S4-S5IV, S6IV and S6III (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4C</ref>). In addition to the contacts with CTD, the III-IV linker also binds to some cytoplasm-facing residues in VSDIV, S6IV and S6III. The first αhelix of CTD interacts with VSDIV and S4-S5IV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). The structure of NavPaS-CTD is nearly identical to that of the Nav1.5-CTD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4D</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65)</ref>. The interface residues between CTD and the S4-S5IV linker, exemplified by the three consecutive negatively charged residues on the first α helix of CTD and the repetitively occurring positive residues on the S4-S5IV linker, are highly conserved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4C</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). Therefore, the cytoplasmic interfaces observed in NavPaS are likely preserved in the human Nav channels. The extensive interactions among the functional elements including VSDIV, S4-S5IV, S6III, S6IV, III-IV linker and CTD provide a molecular foundation to interpret the critical role of VSDIV in inactivation in the recently proposed "asynchronous gating model" (4, 66-68) and the involvement of CTD in inacti-vation <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The voltage sensing domains in distinct conformations</head><p>In the structure of NavPaS, the four VSDs including the connecting loops are completely resolved (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4A</ref>). Unlike the homotetrameric Kv channels and bacterial Nav channels, the relative angles between neighboring VSDs of NavPaS are all several degrees deviated from 90° (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5A</ref>). The lengths and sequences of VSDIV are similar between NavPaS and human Nav1.7 (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). However, the S3 and S4 segments in NavPaS-VSDs are each one helical turn shorter than those in the chimeric VSD generated by fusing the extracellular halves of VSDIV from Nav1.7 to the scaffold of NavAb (designated as the NavAb-1.7 VSD4) (71) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5B</ref>). The four VSDs have different numbers of gating charge residues (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). Similar to the numbering system used in Cav1.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>, we define the Arg/Lys on the last helical turn of the S4 segment as R6. Thereby S4I and S4III have R2-R5, while S4II and S4IV have R2-R6. The invariant Lys (K1) on S4III in human Nav channels is replaced by Gln948 in NavPaS (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>).</p><p>In mammalian Nav channels, the four repeats display distinct activation kinetics with the molecular basis unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(67)</ref>. In the structure of NavPaS, the corresponding gating charges are at different positions relative to the charge transfer center (CTC) and An1, with VSDII and VSDIII at the most and least activated conformations, respectively, among the four (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</p><p>The S4 segments adopt 310 helical conformations in the VSDs of repeats I-III, while the two extracellular helical turns of S4IV relax to α-helix (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5D</ref>). Only R2 in VSDIII is coordinated by An1, while those in the other three VSDs are out of reach of An1. R3 is coordinated by An1 in three VSDs other than VSDII, in which R4 is "up" enough to interact with An1. R5 is similarly coordinated by An2 and the conserved Asp on S3 in VSDI and VSDII. The Cα of R5 in VSDIV is at a further "down" position relative to CTC, but its side chain can still bind to the two CTC negative residues. VSDIII represents the least activated one as its R4 is coordinated by the negative residues of CTC below the occluding residue Phe901 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5D</ref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the Cα atoms of all the gating charges are at similar heights in S4III and S4IV. It is the swing of the long side chain of Arg that places the guanidinium group of R4 below or above the occluding Phe in VSDIII and VSDIV, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5E</ref>). A more pronounced difference involves the backbone shift. The backbone of S4III moves down by one complete helical turn relative to S4II and by half a helical turn in height relative to S4I when the corresponding VSDs are aligned with respect to CTC and An1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5E</ref>). The molecular determinants for the heterogeneous conformations of the VSDs at 0 mV remain to be elucidated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural comparison between NavPaS and Cav1.1</head><p>Among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic Nav and Cav channels whose structures are available, Cav1.1 is most closely related to NavPaS (fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>). Structural comparison of NavPaS and Cav1.1 reveals similarity in the general structural organization and, more interestingly, pronounced conformational changes of both the pore domain and VSDs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6A</ref> and Movie 1).</p><p>When the structures of NavPaS and Cav1.1 are overlaid relative to the funnel constituted by the selectivity filter and pore helices (the P1-SF-P2 segments in the corresponding repeats), VSDII and VSDIV of NavPaS exhibit a slight clockwise rotation from the corresponding domains of Cav1.1 in the intracellular view, while the respective positions of VSDI and VSDIII are similar in the two structures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6A</ref>).</p><p>Despite that both channels are closed at the intracellular gate, the pore domain of NavPaS appears to be further tightened by an overall right-handed screw of the S5 and S6 segments as well as the S4-S5 constriction ring around the central axis of the pore domain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6A</ref> and Movie 1). Similar structural shifts also occur between NavPaS and bacterial Nav channels (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S9</ref>).</p><p>Accompanying the overall twisting of the S6 tetrahelical bundle, each S6 segment undergoes axial rotation starting at the relatively conserved G(S/T)F motif or corresponding positions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6B</ref>, Movie 2, and figs. S1 and S8). Consequently, the afore-mentioned Asn residues point to the central cavity in NavPaS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>), whereas the corresponding ones in Cav1.1 are outside the cavity and able to contact residues in the neighboring S4-S5 segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6B</ref>, Movie 2, and figs. S1 and S8). Single point mutation of the conserved Asn on S6I or S6III alters slow inactivation in Nav1.2 and Nav1.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(72)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(73)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(74)</ref>. The pronounced shifts of the corresponding residues between NavPaS and Cav1.1 provide a clue to the mechanistic understanding of their involvement in slow inactivation.</p><p>The structural comparison between NavPaS and Cav1.1 suggests a potential mechanism for the gating of the pore domain fenestrations (Figs. 3E and 6C and Movie 3). From NavPaS to Cav1.1, the S5 and S6 helical bundles are relaxed through the overall iris-like rotation. Accompanying this motion, all the closed pore fenestrations in the structure of NavPaS become open (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6C</ref> and Movie 3). The fenestration constituted by S6III and S6IV was suggested to be the receptor site for local anesthetic drugs, involving Phe1764 and Tyr1771 in Nav1.2 and Phe1579 in Nav1.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">76)</ref>. The corresponding residue for Nav1.2-Phe1764 and Nav1.4-Phe1579 is Cys1399 in NavPaS, which sits on one side of the fenestration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6C</ref>, inset). Tyr1406, which corresponds to Tyr1771 in Nav1.2, is on the opposite side of the fenestration in the structure of NavPaS, but encloses the fenestration in the conformation of Cav1.1 owing to the axial rotation of S6IV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6C</ref>, inset, and Movie 3). These structural observations may facilitate mechanistic elucidation of the statedependent action of local anesthetics targeting Nav channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Despite that NavPaS and Cav1.1 are both captured at closed conformations and their functional states are yet to be defined, the concerted conformational shifts of pore domain elements and VSDs between the two structures may shed light on the understanding of electromechanical coupling mechanism of voltage-gated ion channels (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and Movies 4 and 5).</p><p>In the cryo-EM structure of Cav1.1, all four VSDs display similar conformations with R5 coordinated by CTC and R4 close to An1 (49), a state reminiscent of NavPaS-VSDII. Therefore, VSDs I, III, and IV in Cav1.1 appear to be more activated than the corresponding ones in NavPaS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). From NavPaS to Cav1.1, the S4 segments in these three VSDs indeed display a tilting motion, which is a combination of upward shift of the helix and outward displacement of the intracellular tip of S4 from the central axis (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref> and Movie 4). The ensuing S4-S5 segments are pulled outward by the S4 segments accordingly. Due to the tight connection between S4-S5 segment and the ensuing S5 segment, any shift of S4-S5 can be immediately translated to S5 in the same repeat.</p><p>The coupled motions between VSDs and pore domain are more evident for VSDI and VSDIII and their respective neighboring pore domain segments (Movie 4). S5II and S5IV appear to undergo concerted shifts with S4I and S4III, respectively, as the involved interfaces are largely preserved in NavPaS and Cav1.1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref> and Movie 4). The neighboring S4-triggered shift of a S5 segment may in turn drag its preceding S4-S5 segment to move accordingly. The motion of one S4-S5 segment would then be coupled to the neighboring S4-S5, S5 and S6 segments. The conformation and position of S6 can also be affected by both S5 in the same repeat and S6 from the neighboring repeat (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>). To be brief, the electromechanical coupling of a voltage-gated ion channel, which is like a delicate gear, may involve extraordinarily intricate interactions among S4-S5, S5, and S6 segments in the same repeat and between neighboring repeats and subsequent re-arrangement of these interactions once the motion is triggered by the voltage-dependent conformational shifts of VSDs (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>).</p><p>More than 1,000 disease-associated mutations have been identified in human Nav channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50)</ref>. It is known that the selectivity filter, gating charge residues, and the III-IV linker are hotspots for disease mutations, while the diseasecausing mechanism for the majority of the mutations remains enigmatic. The structure of NavPaS provides a tem-plate to map hundreds of disease mutations and serves as a framework to mechanistically investigate these mutations (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S10</ref>). For instance, a number of mutations are mapped to the interfaces between S4 and S5 of neighboring repeats. Alteration of the interface residues may affect electromechanical coupling as analyzed above (Fig. <ref type="figure">7, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, and Movie 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The near atomic resolution structure of a single-chain eukaryotic Nav channel establishes an important foundation for investigating the function and disease mechanisms of Nav channels and for structure-guided drug development. Despite the exciting features revealed by the structure, many important questions remain to be answered. The Na + selectivity cannot be explained by a single structure, especially in the absence of the bound Na + in the SF vestibule. The near atomic resolution structure of NavPaS provides the template for molecular dynamics simulations analysis. The conformational changes between NavPaS and Cav1.1 may shed light on the molecular understanding of electromechanical coupling mechanism of Nav and Cav channels. Nonetheless, we have to interpret the conformational changes with caution because the comparison is made for two channels with considerable sequence variations and the functional states of the structures are yet to be defined. A series of structures of the same channel in distinct states are required to establish the structure-function correlation. The technological advances of cryo-EM and a protein that can be conveniently manipulated will make this premise possible.</p></div>

Extensive interactions between the III-IV linker, CTD and adjacent structural elements. (A) The α helix-containing III-IV linker interacts with the globular CTD. An enlarged view of the III-IV linker, the CTD, and the adjacent pore-forming segments are shown in the inset. Residues Ala/Thr/Asp (ATD), which correspond to the fast inactivation motif IMF, are shown as spheres. (B) The IFM motif-corresponding residues are located on a turn connecting S6III and the III-IV helix. Inset: The ATD motif is distanced from the lower layer of the intracellular gate by approximately 15 Å. (C) Extensive interactions between the III-IV linker, CTD, VSDIV, S4-S5IV and S6IV. The polar and charged residues that may contribute to the interactions are shown as sticks. The corresponding residues in human Nav channels, if different from those in NavPaS, are annotated in bracket. (D) NavPaS-CTD is structurally similar to Nav1.5-CTD. The structures of NavPaS-CTD and Nav1.5-CTD (PDB code: 4DCK) can be superimposed with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.318 Å over 71 Cα atoms.</figDesc><graphic coords="14,54.16,72.16,504.00,277.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>

(A) All four VSDs are completely resolved. A bottom view is shown with the intracellular segments omitted for visual clarity. The relative angels between neighboring VSDs are estimated in Chimera, wherein the respective and common centroids of the VSDs are determined and the relative angles are calculated based on the distances between these centroids. (B) The NavPaS-VSDs have shorter S3 and S4 segments than the chimeric NavAb-1.7 VSD4. The structural comparison is made between VSDII and VSDIV of NavPaS with NavAb-1.7 VSD4 (PDB code: 5EK0). (C) The four VSDs exhibit distinct conformations. The four VSD structures are superimposed relative to the charge transfer center (CTC) and An1 on S2. The same reference is used for all the domain comparisons shown in this figure. The shifts of the backbone of S4 and the ensuing S4-S5 linker are indicated by red arrows. Two opposite side views are shown. (D) Structures of the NavPaS-VSDs. For visual clarity, the S1 segment in each VSD is omitted. The side chains of the gating charges on S4, the CTC residues (An2 and the occluding Phe/Tyr on S2, and a conserved Asp on S3), and An1 are shown. The gating charge residues that are coordinated by An1 and An2 are labeled blue and red, respectively. (E) Pairwise comparison of the VSDs.

(A) Comparison of the overall structures of NavPaS and Cav1.1 (PDB code: 5GJV, chain A). The structures are superimposed relative to the funnel constituted by the P1-SF-P2 segments in the four repeats. The CTDs are omitted in the intracellular view. Right panel: The S4-S5 constriction ring appears to be relaxed from NavPaS to Cav1.1. The red arrows indicate the shifts of the corresponding structural elements from NavPaS to Cav1.1 in the intracellular view. (B) The S6 segments undergo axial rotation between NavPaS and Cav1.1, placing the conserved Asn residues inside or outside the central cavity of the pore domain, respectively. Structural alignment suggests that the rotations initiate at the G(S/T)F motif or corresponding positions on S6. (C) Structural shifts of S5 and S6 are coupled to the opening or closure of the fenestrations. Inset: the corresponding residues that are involved in the binding of local anesthetic drugs adopt distinct conformations in NavPaS and Cav1.1. The residues Cys1399 and Tyr1406 correspond to Phe1764 and Tyr1771 in Nav1.2, respectively (75). Please refer to Movies 1 to 3 for detailed analysis of the conformational changes between NavPaS and Cav1.1.</figDesc><graphic coords="16,51.06,72.16,510.20,391.10" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The electromechanical coupling of voltage-gated ion channels with "canonical" fold may involve intricate and extensive interactions between adjacent S4, S4-S5, S5, and S6 segments in the same and neighboring repeats. The potential interactions that are responsible for coupled motions between intra-and interrepeat elements are indicated by orange and red arrows, respectively. (C) A number of disease-related mutations of Nav channels mapped to the interface between S4 and S5 segments in the neighboring repeats. The Cα atoms of representative disease-related residues are shown as spheres and the interface residues are shown as sticks. The residues are color-coded for the Nav subtypes in which the mutations were identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50)</ref>. When mutations occur to the same locus in different channels, the one in the channel with higher number is shown. Please refer to Movies 4 and 5 for the conformational changes illustrated in this figure. Movie 4. Coupled motions between VSDs and pore domain elements. The shifts of S4 and S4-S5 linker in one repeat appear to be coupled to the concerted motion of S5 and S6 in the neighboring repeat.</p><p>Movie 5. Representative disease-related mutations mapped to the interface between S4 and S5 segments in the adjacent repeats.
