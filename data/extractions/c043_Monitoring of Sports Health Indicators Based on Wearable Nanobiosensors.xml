<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Biochemical Experiments of Nanomaterials and Related Investigations on Exercise Health of the Elderly</head><p>*e traditional methods to measure PNK activity include radioisotope labeling and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the disadvantages of these traditional methods are obvious, such as time-consuming, complicated operating procedures, and radioactive isotopes that threaten the safety of the experimenters. In recent years, to solve these problems, researchers have designed and developed many new methods; the most common is the method based on fluorescence. Compared with traditional methods, although these analytical methods have obvious advantages, the disadvantages of these methods are still inevitable. *is method is mainly based on the degradation of phosphorylated DNA by λ exonuclease and the amplification of the electrochemical signals by streptavidin-gold nanoparticle complexes (SA-AuNPs) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>. λ exonuclease is an exonuclease that can degrade and digest 5′ phosphorylated double-stranded DNA but has very low activity on unphosphorylated DNA. Due to their large specific surface area and good biocompatibility, gold nanoparticles are very suitable for use as biomolecular carriers for related analytical research. In this paper, gold nanoparticles were mainly used as carriers of streptavidin (SA) to construct streptavidin-gold nanoparticle complexes (SA-AuNPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. *rough the combination of SA on its surface and biotin, it can capture more biotinylated alkaline phosphatase (biotin-ALP) molecules, thereby amplifying the electrochemical signal. When PNK exists in the system, the substrate probe immobilized on the surface of the gold electrode will be phosphorylated <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>. When the phosphorylated substrate probe hybridizes with the detection probe, the substrate probe will be recognized and degraded by λ exonuclease so that the biotinylated detection probe will dissociate from the electrode surface. SA-AuNPs and biotin-ALP could not be captured on the electrode surface, resulting in a decrease in the electrochemical signal. *e degree of electrochemical signal reduction correlated with the active concentration of PNK <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>. According to this principle, we established a new method to detect the active concentration of PNK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">0e Basic Principle of Signal Amplification Electrochemical Method to Measure PNK Activity</head><p>. *e basic principle of measuring PNK activity based on the signal amplification electrochemical method is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. *e method is mainly based on the degradation of phosphorylated DNA by λ exonuclease and the two-step amplification of the electrochemical signal based on SA-AuNPs and biotin-ALP <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.">Electrochemical Determination of PNK Activity.</head><p>In this paper, gold nanoparticles were used as carriers for SA due to their large specific surface area <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. Several SA molecules may be adsorbed on each gold nanoparticle so that it can bind more biotin-ALP and obtain a larger electrochemical signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, when there is no PNK in the system, under the same experimental conditions, we compared the effect of SA and SA-AuNPs on electrochemical signal amplification. *e results show that the electrochemical signal received when using SA-AuNPs (curve A) is much stronger than that of SA alone (curve B). From this, we can conclude that SA-AuNPs indeed play a good role in amplifying the electrochemical signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Electrochemical Characterization of Electrodes.</head><p>A chemically modified electrode is an electrode made of a conductor or semiconductor. *e surface of the electrode is modified by chemical or physical methods and designed according to people's intentions to form a thin film with expected functions, such as accelerated electron transfer reaction, selective membrane permeation, preferential enrichment, higher selectivity, sensitivity, and stability. Electrochemical impedance is a very effective method for characterizing electrode modification processes. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, each step of the self-assembly of the gold electrode corresponds to an electrochemical impedance spectrum; for example, curve A is the electrochemical impedance spectrum of the bare gold electrode. When the substrate is bound to the electrode surface via Au-S bonds, the electrochemical impedance increases significantly (curve B); when the electrode is blocked with MCH, the electrochemical impedance increases further (curve C). At this time, if we drop 10 U/mL PNK on the electrode surface, after a period of time, add λ exonuclease and detection probe. When the detection probe hybridizes with the substrate probe, the phosphorylated end of the substrate probe is recognized by λ exonuclease, the substrate probe is degraded, and the detection probe will detach from the electrode surface. *is reduces the electron transfer resistance on the electrode surface, resulting in a greatly reduced electrochemical impedance (curve D). *en the electrochemical impedance increases due to the blocking effect of BSA on the nonspecific adsorption sites (curve E). It can be seen that the sensing interface has been successfully constructed and can be used for PNK activity detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5.">Optimization of Experimental Conditions</head><p>. *e test results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. *e I/I0 gradually decreased with the increase of SA-AuNPs collection. When the combination ratio of SA-AuNPs was 1 : 50, the I/I0 value reached the minimum value. It continues to grow, instead of increasing the value of I/I0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. *erefore, in this experiment, the dilution ratio of SA-AuNPs was selected as 1 : 50. We have also optimized the optimal amount of λ exonucleases. *e experimental results show that when the amount of λ exonuclease is 10 U, it is enough to degrade all phosphorylated DNA so that I/I0 reaches the minimum value, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. *erefore, the dosage of λ exonuclease was set as 10 U for the best effect.</p><p>In this experiment, ATP provides phosphate groups for the phosphorylation of DNA, so its concentration is also very critical. We studied the effect of different concentrations of ATP on the process of DNA phosphorylation, and the experimental results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. When the ATP concentration was less than 1 mM, the peak current decreased with increasing ATP concentration. However, when the concentration of ATP continued to increase, the peak current did not continue to decrease, which indicated that the degree of phosphorylation did not increase when the concentration of ATP continued to increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>. *erefore, in the subsequent determination of PNK activity, the ATP concentration was selected as 1 mM.     Under the optimal experimental conditions, we scanned the DPV spectra at different PNK active concentrations, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8(a)</ref>. *e experimental results showed that, with the increase of the active concentration of PNK, the peak current decreased gradually. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8(b)</ref> shows the peak current values corresponding to different active concentrations of PNK. It can be seen from the inset in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>(b) that when the active concentration of PNK is in the range of 0 U/mL to 5 U/mL, the peak current value of the system has a linear relationship with the logarithm of the active concentration of PNK, and the detection limit is 0.01 U/mL.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Structural Design and Performance Regulation of Flexible Piezoresistive Materials.</head><p>A large number of works have shown that the introduction of rough microstructures into FPM can significantly weaken the hysteresis viscoelasticity of the polymer matrix, improve its sensitivity, and reduce the response time, which is one of the important means to prepare high-performance FPM. Not only can the use of the intrinsic rough structure (Ra � 39.4) on the surface of the cotton fiber film save the tedious preparation process of constructing the microstructure in the early stage, but also the cotton fiber film is completely biodegradable. It has a wide range of sources and low prices. It can be used to prepare FPM by loading conductive fillers on the surface of cotton fibers, which opens up new ideas for the preparation of new electronic functional materials. *e internal structure of the microstructure-based FPM is simple, and the sensing mechanism is easy to understand. It is generally believed that the contact area (Ac) of the upper and lower microstructures is squeezed and deformed under the action of external loads (such as pressure, bending, and twisting). *erefore, the increase of the contact area (Ac) leads to the decrease of the contact resistance (Rc) of the entire FPM, and the external mechanical signal is converted into an electrical signal to realize sensing. *is sensing mechanism based on contact resistance can better explain the resistance change law of FPM based on microstructure. However, the contact resistance is still a relatively apparent physical parameter, and explaining the sensing mechanism of the FPM by the contact resistance mechanism cannot penetrate into the core of the FPM.</p><p>As we all know, FPM is the first and foremost conductive material, and its electrical signals (current, resistance, or voltage) are realized by the transmission of electrons. *erefore, the sensing essence of FPM is the change of the conduction path or conduction state of the material before and after the application of the external load. A deeper level is the difference in the electron transport or transfer state before and after the external load is applied. *erefore, designing the difference in the electron transport mechanism before and after the external load is applied is the key to designing the FPM and the core means to realize the performance regulation of the FPM. *e transfer and transport of electrons require conductive fillers as the medium, and the transport of electrons in different media is quite different. For example, the transport of electrons in metals such as gold, silver, and copper is very easy, but the transport in defective carbon materials (such as graphene and carbon nanotubes) is relatively difficult. Because electrons need to traverse a high energy barrier, choosing the right filler to achieve this is particularly critical.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">and Discussion</head><p>. Due to the large number of oxygen-containing functional groups (such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy) on the surface of GO, we can have strong hydrogen bond interactions with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose molecular chain of cotton fibers. *erefore, in this paper, a simple "dip coating-drying" process was used Advances in Materials Science and Engineering 7</p><p>to assemble GO networks on the surface of cotton fibers, and the cleaned cotton fiber films (5 cm × 6 cm × 200 μm) were immersed in 2 mg•mL -1 GO aqueous dispersion. *e color of the cotton fiber film changed from white to light yellow after drying, indicating that GO had been assembled on the surface of the cotton fiber. After the GO cotton fiber film was sealed in a polytetrafluoroethylene liner and reduced by hydrazine hydrate steam, the color of the cotton fiber film became dark black, indicating that GO was reduced to rGO, and a conductive rGO cotton fiber film was obtained.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> shows the change in the mass and resistance of the rGO cotton fiber film with the number of "dippingdrying" times. It can be seen that the quality of the rGO cotton fiber film increases linearly with the increase of the "dip coating-drying" time, and the resistance of the rGO cotton fiber film decreases regularly and gradually with the increase of the "dipping-coating-drying" time. It is shown that the resistance of the rGO cotton fiber film can be regulated simply by adjusting the number of "dippingdrying" times. When the number of "dipping-drying" times is 1 time, the volume resistivity of the rGO cotton fiber film is about 5.1 Ω cm; when the number of "dipping-coatingdrying" times is 8 times, the volume resistivity of the rGO cotton fiber film is about 0.26 Ω cm. *e resistance of rGO cotton fiber film is closely related to the intrinsic conjugated structure of rGO. In contrast, AgNWs cotton fiber films exhibited lower volume resistivity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Attitudes and Cognitions on Exercise Health among the</head><p>Elderly in Urban Communities in Jilin Province. From the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, it can be seen that most of the elderly in urban communities in Jilin Province have a clearer understanding of exercise on health. More than half of the people believe that exercise has a great impact on health and believe that participating in sports can experience a lot of fun and feel good after exercise and it is a part of life. 35% of people think that exercise is more helpful to health; 88% of the respondents think that exercise is of great help to health. On the whole, most people have accepted that exercise is good for health, but 12% think that exercise is less helpful for health, and it is not clear why. *e impact of exercise on health has been scientifically proven, and it has a good effect on the health of the human body. *erefore, we need to make more efforts in the promotion and explanation of sports health knowledge and the training of sports health skills. Secondly, when providing sports health services, whether it is repaid or free, it is necessary to cultivate the correct concept of healthy consumption of the elderly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">0e</head><p>Participation of the Elderly in Sports. *ere are four main motivations for the participation of the elderly in urban communities through data review. In the survey of a total of 210 people, 163 people chose to improve their physical fitness, 115 people chose hobbies, and the third place was to make friends and have fun. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>, it can be seen that the main motivation for the elderly to participate in sports in urban communities in Jilin Province is to improve their physical fitness, which is quite different from the number of people selected for the option of curing diseases and maintaining health. *e elderly have a profound understanding of the promotion of health through exercise and can recognize that exercise is a defense against disease, not a cure. *e second is hobbies. From the perspective of the elderly, we believe that the elderly have a high enthusiasm for sports, and making friends and entertainment also account for a large reason. *e elderly regard  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D R E T R A C T E D</head><p>sports and fitness as the pleasure of life, which are basically some low-intensity and highly interesting sports activities. Due to their own physical characteristics, the elderly should try to choose nonconfrontational sports with low exercise intensity, long exercise time, and simple and easy operation. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, after a survey in Jilin urban communities, it was found that many people chose running sports, and 41% of the elderly would prefer running in the choice of fitness sports. Running is simple and easy to implement and has the advantages of easy regulation of exercise volume, no need for special venues, and single or multiperson exercise. *e second is chess and cards, which is interesting and competitive and is one of the favorite events of the elderly, and there are relatively few martial arts and dance exercises. *e main reason is that there are certain gender restrictions; most of the martial arts sports are male, and women like less. While women in dance gymnastics are more common, such as square dance, men participate less. In sports, there is basically a situation in which one dominates, and many go hand in hand.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>, the elderly tend to have a variety of exercise and fitness methods. In terms of fitness methods, the elderly basically choose to exercise freely by themselves and occasionally participate in sports activities organized by the neighborhood committee. *ey participate in tutoring centers, clubs, or units. From the data, only 15% of the elderly have participated in sports activities specially organized the neighborhood committee or an organization for the elderly. *is also reflects that most of the former elderly exercised on their own initiative and hardly participated in sports activities organized by teams and associations, which reflects the current shortage of sports health services for the elderly, and many needs are not met.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref>, according to the survey statistics, most people exercise in the morning and evening, and nearly half of the people in the survey sample will choose to exercise in the morning or evening. *e number of people who exercise in the morning and evening is basically the same, the second is that the number of people who choose to exercise in the evening is relatively small, and a small number of people choose to exercise at other time periods. It can be seen that the time of the elderly is relatively loose and discretionary.</p><p>After investigation and research, the total number of venues of various types in the surveyed sample communities is shown in the numerical column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">6</ref>, and the chess and card venues ranked first, accounting for 22.83%, followed by martial arts, healthcare, and running; of course, these two sports do not have very high requirements on the venue, and they are basically universal. *e values are relatively close, and other types of venues also account for a relatively high proportion, mainly because of a wide variety. From the data, it can be seen that there are relatively few sports venues for elderly water, and it is more suitable for the </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>*ere are many types of biosensors, and different types of biosensors have specific uses in specific environments. And biosensors are closely related to nanomaterials, so the research and development of nanomaterials is of great significance in the development of biosensors. In the future, we will continue to develop nanomaterials to make them more suitable for current needs. With the rapid development of nanomaterials, the application of new nanomaterials has also been continuously expanded, and the problem of sports health of the elderly has always puzzled many scientists. *e biochemical properties of nanomaterials and the health of the elderly have become the mainstream research directions. In this paper, an electrochemical research method for detecting the kinase activity of polynucleotides by streptavidin-gold nanoparticles and enzyme amplification is proposed based on the thermophysical properties of materials and the properties of nanoparticles. *e experimental results show that, compared with the traditional electrochemical method, the method has the advantages of simple operation, high sensitivity, and high selectivity, its linear range is from 0 U/mL to 5 U/mL, and the detection limit is 0.01 U/mL. In contrast, AgNWs cotton fiber films exhibited lower volume resistivity. Future work is needed to develop a more sensitive nanoparticle biosensor to address current market needs. In any case, the experimental design of this paper provides a direction for future research and is of great significance to related researchers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>4. 1 .Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the basic principle of biosensors.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,381.95,81.80,85.24,79.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
