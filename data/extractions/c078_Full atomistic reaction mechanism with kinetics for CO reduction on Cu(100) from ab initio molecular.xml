<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A critical step toward the rational design of new catalysts that achieve selective and efficient reduction of CO 2 to specific hydrocarbons and oxygenates is to determine the detailed reaction mechanism including kinetics and product selectivity as a function of pH and applied potential for known systems. To accomplish this, we apply ab initio molecular metadynamics simulations (AIMμD) for the water/Cu(100) system with five layers of the explicit solvent under a potential of -0.59 V [reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] at pH 7 and compare with experiment. From these free-energy calculations, we determined the kinetics and pathways for major products (ethylene and methane) and minor products (ethanol, glyoxal, glycolaldehyde, ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, ethane, and methanol). For an applied potential (U) greater than -0.6 V (RHE) ethylene, the major product, is produced via the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism using H 2 O + e -. The rate-determining step (RDS) is C-C coupling of two CO, with ΔG ‡ = 0.69 eV. For an applied potential less than -0.60 V (RHE), the rate of ethylene formation decreases, mainly due to the loss of CO surface sites, which are replaced by H*. The reappearance of C 2 H 4 along with CH 4 at U less than -0.85 V arises from *CHO formation produced via an ER process of H* with nonadsorbed CO (a unique result). This *CHO is the common intermediate for the formation of both CH 4 and C 2 H 4 . These results suggest that, to obtain hydrocarbon products selectively and efficiency at pH 7, we need to increase the CO concentration by changing the solvent or alloying the surface. T o reduce the carbon footprint while converting renewable energy sources (such as the wind or solar) into stable chemical forms, we need to develop an economical process for the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to chemicals and fuels. Copper (Cu) is the only nonalloyed metal that can electrochemically catalyze the formation of significant amounts of hydrocarbons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. However, Cu leads to an overpotential of almost 1 V for a reasonable current (5-10 mA•cm -2 ) and faradaic efficiency (&gt;69%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and it leads to a fairly broad mixture of major and minor products, including hydrogen (H 2 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), and methane (CH 4 ) as major products plus small amounts of other C 2 s and oxygenates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Although Cu remains far from ideal for CO 2 reduction, it provides a benchmark for determining and validating the mechanism underlying Cu's unique ability to catalyze hydrocarbon formation. This mechanism can then provide a basis for designing new catalysts that increase product selectivity and rates while simultaneously lowering overpotentials. Some excellent reviews summarize previous research associated with CO 2 RR on copper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Although many aspects of the mechanism remain unknown, CO is established as an important intermediate producing both C 2 H 4 and methane CH 4 as major products. Indeed electroreduction of CO leads to similar product distributions and onset potentials as observed for CO 2 RR (5-8). Online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) was used to identify the products formed from the electroreduction of various compounds that might be intermediates on the C 2 H 4 and ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</p><p>The formation of CH 4 from CO depends on pH in such a way that the rate-determining step (RDS) must involve the transfer of a proton and an electron <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. Recent experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the key intermediate in the formation of CH 4 are *CHO on Cu(100) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and Cu(211) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> and *COH on Cu(111) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. On the other hand, the formation of C 2 H 4 from CO does not depend on pH. Therefore, a dimer of CO, whose formation does not involve the transfer of a hydrogen atom but does depend on potential, has been suggested as the key intermediate in the C-C coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</p><p>The selectivity toward C 1 and C 2 production also depends on the surface structure of the copper electrode. For example, the formation of CH 4 is favored on Cu(111), whereas formation of C 2 H 4 is dominant on Cu(100) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>, and C 2 H 5 OH is generated at Cu(110) and Cu(511) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Evidence also exists that Cu polycrystalline (PC) generates ample amounts of C 2 H 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>, indicating that Cu(100) is the dominant crystal facet of Cu PC. Indeed, operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy showed that a Cu PC electrode held at a fixed negative potential undergoes stepwise surface reconstruction to establish the Cu(100) surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> shows the competition between C 2 H 4 formation, hydrogen evolution (HER), and CH 4 formation as a function of applied potential (U) observed experimentally in CO reduction reactions (CORR) on Cu(100) at pH 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. C 2 H 4 formation starts at U = -0.40 V [reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and increases to a maximum at -0.60 V with a high current that is hard to explain by the reduction of a surface-adsorbed species <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p>Converting CO 2 to fuels is of great interest nowadays. Copper (Cu) is the only metal that produces hydrocarbon products, making it of interest for learning the reaction mechanisms underlying the selectivity and activity of Cu catalysts. In this report, we examine the reaction mechanism of CO reduction on Cu(100) at pH 7 including explicitly the aqueous solvent with ab initio molecular metadynamics simulations (AIMμD) freeenergy calculations, which we find to explain all experimental observations. We expect that this understanding will suggest how to modify the Cu catalyst or replace it with a new material to enhance production of just a single such product while reducing the energy requirements (overpotential).</p><p>Significant H 2 initiates at U = -0.4 V (RHE) and increases monotonically as U becomes more negative, which is the major contribution to current <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. C 2 H 4 formation decreases from -0.60 V (RHE) down to 0 at U = -0.80 V (RHE), whereas H 2 production increases but without producing CH 4 . At U = -0.85 V (RHE), the formation of CH 4 first appears with C 2 H 4 again observed, with both amounts increasing monotonically for more negative potentials.</p><p>Quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations can provide atomistic mechanistic insight about CORR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. However, previous studies have all been deficient in not fully including solvent effects. Early calculations ignored the solvent in the simulation but corrected afterward <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>, whereas later studies used a variety of implicit solvation methods sometimes with a few explicit solvent molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. These various studies led to a range of inconsistent results. For example, the predicted freeenergy barriers for CO dimerization range from 0.33 to 1.22 eV, depending on the solvation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.

These free-energy calculations provide a thorough reaction mechanism for major hydrocarbon productions (ethylene and ethane) and minor productions in CORR, which should help guide the design of new generations of catalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Applied Potentials Less Negative Than -0.6 V (U greater than -0.6 V).</p><p>C 2 H 4 is the product with the lowest kinetic barrier. For U = -0.4 to -0.6 V (RHE), our calculations with explicit solvent find that the most favorable reduction of CO is C-C coupling to form *CO-CO, which has a free-energy barrier for the transition state saddle point (ΔG ‡ ) of 0.69 eV. We find that *CO-CO is quickly hydrated to *CO-COH, which then is quickly reduced to *COH-COH. The reaction barriers for these two steps are both within 0.14 eV. Indeed, we observe these reactions directly in our ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, because the low reaction barriers are surmounted within a few picoseconds. These reactions are via the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism using H 2 O + e -. Actually, in our calculations, we found that when adding hydrogen to oxygen, reactions via ER always have lower Summarizing, we find that adding hydrogen to carbon species through the ER mechanisms always has a lower reaction barrier than reactions through LH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) in the C 2 H 4 formation pathway. Therefore, at U = -0.59 V (RHE) and pH 7, the lowest kinetic reaction pathway for C 2 H 4 formation is purely through the ER mechanism, so that no step requires surface hydrogen (H*). This ER pathway explains the high current for C 2 H 4 formation observed experimentally, which is beyond that expected from surface reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. In this ER pathway of C 2 H 4 formation, CO dimerization is the RDS with ΔG ‡ = 0.69 eV.</p><p>The second pathway to the C 2 H 4 product. A second pathway for C 2 H 4 formation is through *CCO, which was first proposed by Calle-Vallejo and Koper <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Indeed, *CCO formation is energetically more favorable on Cu(100), but ΔG ‡ for *CCO formation (0.69) is 0.67 eV higher than that of *COH-COH formation (0.02), making it kinetically forbidden. Thus, the *CCO pathway provides only a minor contribution to the C 2 H 4 formation.</p><p>In this *CCO pathway for C 2 H 4 formation, *CCO is first reduced to *CH-CO via LH with ΔG ‡ = 0.69 eV. Then, *CH-CO is reduced to *CH-COH with ΔG ‡ = 1.49 eV via LH, which merges into the *COH-COH pathway to also form C 2 H 4 .  The entire reaction pathway for CH 4 formation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. Snapshots of reactive intermediates from AIMD simulations are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>.</p><p>At pH 7, *CHO formation is the RDS for CH 4 formation with ΔG ‡ = 0.96 eV via LH, whereas CO dimerization is the RDS for C 2 H 4 formation with ΔG ‡ = 0.69 eV. Therefore, at pH 7, C 2 H 4 is predominant for U greater than -0.8 V (RHE), as experimentally observed. Note that *CHO formation is pH dependent, whereas C-C coupling is pH independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Thus, at pH 0, ΔG ‡ of *CHO formation decreases to 0.55 eV (0.96 -0.0592 × 7), whereas the reaction barrier of C-C coupling remains at 0.69 eV. This pH dependency explains why CH 4 is predominant at pH 0, as experimentally observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>HER is the major side reaction competing with CO reduction, which limits the faradaic efficiency. It is known that the presence of CO retards HER due to the stronger binding of CO to Cu metal surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. On the Cu(100) surface, our QM calculations with full solvation lead to a binding energy (ΔE b ) of -0.80 eV for CO and -0.11 eV for H atom (hollow site) reference to H 2 . Therefore, at zero applied potential (U = 0 V), the binding energy of CO is much larger than that of H*. The maximum CO coverage can reach 1/3 ML, as predicted in a previous DFT calculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref>.</p><p>Comparison with experiment and previous calculations. On the Cu(100) surface, C 2 H 4 formation starts at U = -0.4 V and is pH independent (RHE dependent) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, indicating that the RDS does not involve hydrogen. Additionally, no CH 4 formation is observed at this potential, pointing out that the mechanism is different from at U less than -0.8 V, where there is branching to both C 2 H 4 and CH 4 . These experimental observations agree with the theory that the first step of C 2 H 4 formation is related to coupling of two CO molecules mediated by electron transfer to form *CO-CO.</p><p>We find that ΔG ‡ = 0.69 eV for the RDS. Previous calculations of the reaction barrier for CO dimerization have ranged from 0.33 to 1.22 eV, depending on the solvation models and applied potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Potentials from -0.6 to -0.8 V. The above tendencies for U greater than -0.8 V are reversed for more negative U. As U becomes more negative, the ΔE B of H increases with a slope close to 1 eV/V [H 2 O(aq) + e -→ OH -(aq) + H*]. In contrast, more negative U has little impact on ΔE B of CO, because charges barely transfer during CO adsorption. To validate this, the charge transfers during CO adsorption were calculated under fixed applied potentials by optimizing the number of electrons (N e ) along the reaction path <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref> within the framework of joint density functional theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref>, and the solvation effects was handled by the charge-asymmetric nonlocally determined local-electric implicit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(29)</ref>. We find that, for increasingly negative U, ΔE B of H* increases, and finally matches the CO binding at U = -0.69 V (RHE). Consequently, at U more negative than -0.69, surface H* and *CO compete for surface sites. Although no experimental data are available about the surface coverage of H under CORR condition, previous experimental studies (analyzed based on Volmer-Heyrovsky pathways and Volmer-Tafel pathways) estimated the surface coverage of H* to range from 0.3 to 1.0 at large negative overpotentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, experiments on Cu(100) starting from U = -0.64 to -0.70 V (saturated calomel electrode) or -0.40 to -0.46 V (RHE) suggest that H* induces reconstruction leading to a concomitant increase in HER <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref>. A recent in situ surfaceenhanced spectroscopic experiment shows that at -0.7 V H* is  capable of partially displacing *CO; however, *CO is unable to displace H* to any detectable level <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(33)</ref>. This increase in H* coverage causes a decrease in CO surface coverage that significantly slows the CO dimerization and hence C 2 H 4 formation. We consider that site-blocking effects explain the decline of C 2 H 4 formation down to 0 as U = -0.60 goes to -0.80 V <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. Of course, we cannot exclude that other effects may contribute, such as deposition of metal impurities <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref> and mass diffusion limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref>. Potentials are more negative than -0.8 V. Interestingly, we found that this site-blocking effect at very negative U does not block *CHO formation, which can be explained by *CHO formation proceeding via an ER mechanism from nonadsorbed CO. To demonstrate this, we carried out simulations for the extreme case of full H* (1 ML) coverage to block all available sites for CO adsorption. Under this condition, any CO on the surface would quickly desorb. With explicit solvent, we calculate that at 1-ML H* coverage, the distance of CO from the Cu surface is ∼3.35 Å (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>). We find that ΔG ‡ = 1.01 eV for this solvent CO to react with a surface H* to produce *CHO, very close to the value (ΔG ‡ = 0.96 eV) derived at low H* coverage for adsorbed CO to react with H*. As a consequence, the H* site-blocking effect does not block *CHO formation. Because *CHO formation can proceed from a reaction pathway in which CO is not adsorbed (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>), we can understand the appearance of CH 4 at U less than -0.85 V (RHE).</p><p>We calculate that recurrence of C 2 H 4 for U less than -0.85 arises from the pathway in which nonadsorbed CO reacts with *CHO, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>. In this case, a second nonadsorbed CO reacts with *CHO to form *CO-CHO with ΔG ‡ = 0.71 eV. Goodpaster et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> first proposed this reaction pathway to explain the recurrence of C 2 H 4 production. Although our predicted ΔG ‡ is close to the Goodpaster value, 0.68 eV, our reaction pathways are significantly different. Goodpaster assumed CO already adsorbed on the Cu surface based on his implicit solvation model, whereas we find that a nonadsorbed CO is a reactant in our explicit solvent calculations. Consequently, our mechanism involves only one surface site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>), which we expect to be close to the experimental conditions at U less than -0.85 V (RHE).</p><p>Summarizing, we find that the recurrence of C 2 H 4 at U less than -0.85 V (RHE) is due to the coupling of nonadsorbed CO with *CHO. Consequently, C 2 H 4 and CH 4 formation share a common intermediate, which explains the appearance of C 2 H 4 and CH 4 following each other for U &lt; 0.85 V (RHE).</p><p>Summary of Reaction Mechanism for CH 4 and C 2 H 4 Products for All Potentials. Armed with the complete free-energy information from above, we can now explain the reaction mechanism of CORR on Cu(100) at pH 7 as follows:</p><p>For U greater than -0.6 V (RHE), C 2 H 4 is the major product through CO dimerization with ΔG ‡ = 0.69 eV. We find that H 2 O is the hydrogen source for all these reduction steps in C 2 H 4 formation, leading to a high current as experimentally observed. CH 4 was not observed at U greater than -0.85 V (RHE), because *CHO formation is unfavorable due to the high reaction barrier (ΔG ‡ = 0.96 eV via adsorbed CO and the ΔG ‡ = 1.01 eV via nonadsorbed CO). As U decreases from -0.6 to -0.8 V, the H* binding energy increases, leading to an increased surface concentration of H*, with a concomitant decreased concentration of *CO, which significantly slows C 2 H 4 formation and finally totally blocks this reaction for U = -0.80 V. At U less than -0.85 V, a nonadsorbed CO hydrogenation pathway contributes to the occurrence of CH4 in addition to the adsorbed CO pathway. The reoccurrence of C 2 H 4 formation for U less than -0.85 V in parallel with CH 4 arises from *CO-CHO formation through nonadsorbed CO coupling with *CHO. Thus, *CHO is the common intermediate for both C 2 H 4 and CH 4 formation at U less than -0.85 V.</p><p>Other Hydrocarbon and Oxygenate Products. Apart from the two major hydrocarbon products, small amounts of several other C1 to C3 products are observed experimentally under CO 2 reduction conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The mechanisms for the formation of these minor productions are also an important part of CORR and CO 2 RR. We find the lowest kinetic reaction pathways to minor products of C 2 products at pH 7 proceed as follows (in each case, the number below the arrow is the ΔG ‡ ):   [4]</p><p>v) Acetaldehyde (CH 3 -CHO):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CH 2 = CHOH ! 1.22 CH 3 -CHO.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Summarizing, we carried out AIMD reactive dynamics simulations with five layers of explicit water to determine the mechanism of CORR on Cu(100) surface at pH 7. We determined the reaction pathways including free-energy reaction barriers for major products (C 2 H 4 and CH 4 ), and for six minor C2 products (ethanol, glyoxal, glycolaldehyde, ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, ethane, and methanol). These computations fully explain experimental observations, including the competition between electrochemical reactions and surface sites.</p><p>At U greater than -0.6 V, we found that C 2 H 4 formation dominates over CH 4 formation. Two *CO couple to form a C-C bond with an energy barrier of 0.69 eV, much lower than for *CHO formation (0.96 eV). Therefore, C 2 H 4 is the major hydrocarbon product for U greater than -0.8 V. Interestingly, we find that C 2 H 4 proceeds purely via ER mechanisms, explaining why experiments observe high currents associated with the C 2 H 4 formation in this regime.</p><p>For U less than -0.6V and U greater than -0.8V, H* displaces CO from the surface sites, because H* has a stronger binding energy than CO. Consequently, the surface coverage of H* increases monotonically for more negative potentials, blocking CO adsorption. This decrease of CO surface coverage slows CO dimerization to shut off C 2 H 4 production as U = -0.6 V goes to -0.8 V. Of course other factors, such as HER-induced surface reconstruction, deposition of metal impurities <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref>, and mass diffusion limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref>, may also contribute to blocking CO adsorption.</p><p>At U less than -0.8 V, we found that both CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are produced by using nonadsorbed CO. Here, *CHO becomes the common intermediate for both CH 4 and C 2 H 4 formation.</p><p>Considering this full picture of CORR, we see that U greater than -0.6 V is the optimum region to obtain hydrocarbon products selectivity. To increase the reaction rates in this regime, we need to accelerate CO dimerization. Ways to achieve this include the following: increasing the local concentration of CO (for example, by modifying the electrolyte or by conjoining the Cu with another element such as Ag or Au that can produce CO from CO 2 ) (36); and increasing the binding energy of CO, perhaps by alloying or using nanotechnologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38)</ref>.</p></div>

The formation of *COH-COH explains the experimental observation of C 2 oxygenated products containing two oxygens, such as glycolaldehyde (CH 2 OH-CHO) and ethylene glycol (CH 2 OH-CH 2 OH) (3). Dihydroxylation of *COH-COH leads to the formation of *C-COH with ΔG ‡ = 0.62 eV via ER. Reduction of *C-COH to *CH-COH has ΔG ‡ = 0.44 eV via ER (0.91 eV via LH). The next step is dihydroxylation of *CH-COH to *CH-C with ΔG ‡ = 0.61 eV via ER by using H 2 O + e -. The reactions from *CH-C to C 2 H 4 seem straightforward, showing selectivity toward hydrocarbon species. Thus, *CH-C is reduced to *CH 2 -C instead of *CH-CH, because ΔG ‡ = 0.61 eV (ER) for *CH 2 -C formation (ΔG ‡ = 0.93 eV via LH) is lower than the ΔG ‡ = 1.07 eV (ER) for *CH-CH formation (1.41 eV via LH). We find that *CH 2 -C is reduced to *CH 2 -CH with ΔG ‡ = 0.49 eV (ER) (1.10 eV via LH). Finally, formation of C 2 H 4 from *CH 2 -CH has ΔG ‡ = 0.38 eV (ER) (1.15 eV via LH).</figDesc></figure>
