<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The toxic proline:arginine (PR n ) poly-dipeptide encoded by the (GGGGCC) n repeat expansion in the C9orf72 form of heritable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) binds to the central channel of the nuclear pore and inhibits the movement of macromolecules into and out of the nucleus. The PR n poly-dipeptide binds to polymeric forms of the phenylalanine:glycine (FG) repeat domain, which is shared by several proteins of the nuclear pore complex, including those in the central channel. A method of chemical footprinting was used to characterize labile, cross-β polymers formed from the FG domain of the Nup54 protein. Mutations within the footprinted region of Nup54 polymers blocked both polymerization and binding by the PR n poly-dipeptide. The aliphatic alcohol 1,6-hexanediol melted FG domain polymers in vitro and reversed PR n -mediated enhancement of the nuclear pore permeability barrier. These data suggest that toxicity of the PR n poly-dipeptide results in part from its ability to lock the FG repeats of nuclear pore proteins in the polymerized state. Our study offers a mechanistic interpretation of PR n poly-dipeptide toxicity in the context of a prominent form of ALS.</p><p>C9orf72 repeat expansion | PR n poly-dipeptide | nuclear pore | FG domain | labile cross-β polymers E xpansion of the (GGGGCC) n hexanucleotide repeat within the first intron of the C9orf72 gene is the genetic alteration leading to the most prevalent heritable form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.

Expression of either the glycine:arginine (GR n ) or proline:arginine (PR n ) poly-dipeptide in Drosophila melanogaster leads to toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, and synthetic forms of both peptides are toxic to mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Three previous reports have led to the common finding that toxicity of RNA transcripts of the hexanucleotide expansion, or of poly-dipeptides encoded by the expansion, can be rescued by altered expression of specific cellular proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. An unbiased screen of D. melanogaster genes that, when deleted, either exacerbate or mitigate C9orf72 toxicity led to the discovery of proteins involved in both RNA biogenesis and nuclear transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Similar findings were reported for the underexpression or overexpression of yeast proteins that modulate toxicity of the PR n poly-dipeptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, two independent proteomic approaches have been used to examine the distribution of intracellular proteins targeted by the toxic PR n and GR n poly-dipeptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. Prominent among the intracellular targets of these toxic polydipeptides are nucleoporin proteins, including those composed of phenylalanine:glycine (FG) repeats (Nup54, Nup98, Nup153, and Nup214).</p><p>Here we report that the toxic PR n poly-dipeptide binds to the central channel of the nuclear pore and inhibits the transport of macromolecules into and out of the nucleus. The PR n polydipeptide also binds to polymeric forms of FG repeats derived from two proteins of the nuclear pore complex (Nup54 and Nup98). These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how the PR n poly-dipeptide might poison a fundamental aspect of cell function in the context of ALS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Toxic PR n Poly-Dipeptide Binds the Central Channel of Nuclear Pores and Impedes the Import and Export of Macromolecules. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked to 20 repeats of the PR n polydipeptide was applied to Triton X-100-permeabilized mammalian cells. This GFP:PR 20 fusion protein bound to the nuclear periphery in a punctate pattern. Colocalization of the GFP:PR 20 fusion protein with labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) suggested that it might be binding to nuclear pores (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined hand-isolated giant nuclei from Xenopus laevis oocytes. A peptide composed of 20 repeats of PR 20 was synthesized with a fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) or Atto-647 dye attached to the amino terminus. In these experiments, a large fragment of the nuclear envelope was attached to a coverslip and viewed face-on by super-resolution microscopy. Both PR 20 and WGA bound to the nuclear envelope in a punctate pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Some envelopes treated with PR 20 or WGA were immunostained with an antibody against gp210, a protein known to occupy the periphery of the nuclear pore complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. In both cases, a gp210 label surrounded the PR 20 or WGA label (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We conclude that PR 20 , like WGA, binds to the central channel of the nuclear pore complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p>A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene represents the most prominent form of heritable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Bidirectional transcription and ATG-independent translation of the expanded (GGGGCC) n repeat specifies the production of toxic glycine:arginine (GR n ) and proline:arginine (PR n ) poly-dipeptides. The present study provides evidence that the PR n poly-dipeptide binds directly to the central channel of nuclear pores, causing inhibition of both the import and export of macromolecules to and from the nucleus. Nuclear pore binding is shown to be mediated via direct interaction between the toxic PR n poly-dipeptide and polymeric forms of nuclear pore proteins enriched in phenylalanine:glycine repeats.</p><p>A more detailed analysis of the localization of the dye-labeled PR 20 poly-dipeptide on X. laevis nuclear pores is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. These data reveal an annular pattern of peptide binding corresponding to a ring with an outside diameter of 68 nm. This observation closely corresponds to the physical dimensions of nuclear pores as deduced by a previous independent super-resolution microscopy study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, which used dye-labeled WGA to visualize the central channel of nuclear pores and was interpreted to reflect WGA staining of nucleoporin proteins rich in FG repeats. FG domains are heavily glycosylated by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine, thus accounting for avid binding by the WGA lectin probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Given the similarity in WGA and PR 20 staining patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), it is possible that the PR 20 polydipeptide might also bind to the FG domains of nucleoporin proteins located within the central channel of nuclear pores.</p><p>Having observed PR 20 binding to the nuclear pore complex, we next tested whether cells exposed to the peptide might show changes in the transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. We examined export by comparing the accumulation of polyA + RNA in nuclei of control U2OS cells with that in nuclei of cells exposed to the synthetic PR 20 peptide. In situ hybridization of cells treated with the PR 20 peptide showed an increase of polyA + RNA in nuclear foci. This finding may be attributable to deficits in the export of macromolecules from the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>), and also may be consistent with PR 20 -mediated impediments to pre-mRNA splicing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. We also examined nuclear import by comparing the localization of a GFP protein tagged with both nuclear localization and export signals in control U2OS cells and in cells treated with the PR 20 peptide. The peptide impeded the nuclear import of GFP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</p><p>To further test the effect of PR 20 on nuclear import, we permeabilized HeLa cells with digitonin and exposed them to HeLa cytosol and fluorescent-tagged bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to a nuclear localization peptide. Microscopic analysis of control cells revealed exclusive nuclear localization of the fluorescent-tagged BSA (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). The same experiment performed in the presence of increasing doses of the PR 20 peptide resulted in graded exclusion of BSA from the nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure">3D</ref>). No impediment to the transport of BSA was observed when permeabilized HeLa cells were exposed to either 2.5 μM or 5 μM concentrations of synthetic PG 20 or PA 20 poly-dipeptides (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). Thus, among the three poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9orf72 repeat expansion analyzed in this study, only the PR 20 variant was able to impede nuclear pore function.</p><p>Toxic PR n Poly-Dipeptide Binds to Polymeric Forms of the FG Domains of Nup54 and Nup98. FG repeats are found in several proteins of the nuclear pore complex, including those in the central channel, and are believed to form the major filtration barrier of the nuclear pore <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. WGA binds to glycosylated FG domains, thereby inhibiting nuclear transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. The similar patterns of PR 20 and WGA staining of nuclear pores (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) suggests that the toxic PR n poly-dipeptide might bind to FG domains of nuclear pore proteins as well.</p><p>When expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and incubated under physiological salt concentrations at neutral pH, the lowcomplexity (LC) domains of many RNA-binding proteins polymerize into labile, cross-β fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Previous studies of nucleoporin proteins have described polymerization of FG domains into cross-β fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. We observed similar evidence of the polymerization of recombinant proteins composed of the FG domains of the human Nup54 and Nup98 nucleoporin proteins. We used three methods to characterize these polymers: transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and semidenaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE). After negative staining and visualization by electron microscopy, both Nup54 and Nup98 polymers appeared as unbranched fibers ∼10 nm wide and of indefinite length (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). Polymers concentrated by centrifugation were buffer-exchanged into deionized water, lyophilized, and evaluated by X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>, both Nup54 and Nup98 polymers yielded diffraction rings prototypical of amyloid polymers (4.7 and 10 Å, respectively). When evaluated by SDD-AGE, both polymers dissolved and migrated in the monomeric state (Fig. <ref type="figure">4C</ref>). Thus, although polymers formed by the FG repeats of Nup54 and Nup98 display morphologies and X-ray diffraction patterns indistinguishable from those of highly stable, prion-like amyloids, both are markedly different in being labile to depolymerization on dilution.</p><p>We next performed a chemical footprinting assay to probe the structure of Nup54 polymers. Nup54 protein existing in either the polymeric state or the denatured state was exposed to N-acetylimidazole (NAI), a relatively nonspecific acetylating agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Unlabeled protein was probed by NAI modification in the polymeric state. Protein probed in the denatured, monomeric state was isotopically labeled with 13  culture (SILAC) mass spectrometry. As first described by Xiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, the difference map in NAI-mediated acetylation of polymeric vs. monomeric samples can yield a chemical footprint diagnostic of the polymeric state. For Nup54 polymers, we observed a chemical footprint centrally located within the FG domain (Fig. <ref type="figure">4D</ref>).</p><p>We probed the functional relevance of the NAI footprint of Nup54 polymers by mutagenesis, wherein phenylalanine residues were mutated to proline. The effects of F-to-P mutations on polymerization of the Nup54 FG domain were assessed by a thioflavin-T polymerization assay (Fig. <ref type="figure">4E</ref>). Polymer formation for one mutant, which changed phenylalanine residues 25 and 28 to proline, was only mildly impeded. Intermediate impediments to polymerization were observed for three of the mutants (F41/53P, F53/ 61P, and F87/90P), whereas complete inhibition of polymerization was observed for the double mutant that altered phenylalanine residues located at the center of the NAI footprint (the F39/41P double mutant).</p><p>We next performed tests of PR 20 binding to Nup54 and Nup98 polymers. Fluorescent-tagged PR 20 peptide bound the polymeric forms of both FG domains, but not to the soluble forms of the proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Binding was competed by unlabeled PR 20 peptide, but not by either of the PG 20 or PA 20 peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5 B</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). No binding of the PR 20 probe was observed for the F39/41P double mutant of Nup54 even after incubation under conditions fully adequate for polymerization of the native FG domains of Nup54 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5E</ref>). Finally, Nup54 and Nup98 FG domain polymers were exposed to FITC-labeled PR 20 peptide and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent peptide bound rapidly, decorating the full length of each FG domain polymer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5F</ref>).</p><p>Aliphatic Alcohols Melt FG Domain Polymers and Impede Binding of the Toxic PR n Poly-Dipeptide. Aliphatic alcohols, including 1,6hexanediol (1,6-HD), are known to compromise the permeability barrier of the nuclear pore <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. Having observed that the FG domains of the Nup54 and Nup98 nucleoporins can polymerize into labile, cross-β polymers, we then exposed the samples to either 1,6-HD or 2,5-hexanediol (2,5-HD). Polymeric fibers formed from the FG domains of Nup54 and Nup98 were effectively dissolved by 1,6-HD, but less so by 2,5-HD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6A</ref>). The 1,6-HD also inhibited PR 20 binding to the polymeric fibers to a far greater degree than achieved by 2,5-HD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6B</ref>).</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6C</ref>, 70-kDa dextran does not normally enter the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells; however, it does enter the nucleus when the buffer is supplemented with 7% 1,6-HD, but not with 2,5-HD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> C and D). We hypothesize that 1,6-HD compromises the permeability barrier of nuclear pores by dissolving polymeric FG domains of nucleoporins. To test this assumption, we pretreated cells with either the PR 20 peptide or WGA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> C and E), both of which bind FG domains. In both cases, the ability of 1,6-HD to facilitate nuclear import of the 70-kDa dextran was impaired, suggesting that nucleoporin polymers had been stabilized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Three independent studies have reported that the movement of macromolecules in and out of the nucleus is compromised in cells that carry the hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) n in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Modifiers of this toxicity include genes encoding nucleolar proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and components of the nuclear pore complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. Toxicity related to the (GGGGCC) n expansion has been variously attributed to functional disruption of the C9orf72 gene itself (1, 2), to deleterious effects of either the sense or antisense transcript of the repeats <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>, and to repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation products of the transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. Of the five poly-dipeptides encoded by the sense and antisense transcripts of the (GGGGCC) n expansion, the arginine-rich GR n and PR n polydipeptides have been reported to exert significant toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, two independent proteomic studies identified hundreds of intracellular targets of the toxic GR n and PR n polydipeptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. Both studies found a wide range of RNAbinding proteins, intermediate filament proteins, constituents of intracellular puncta not surrounded by investing membranes, and nuclear pore proteins as targets of the toxic poly-dipeptides. Common among many of these intracellular targets is the presence of intrinsically disordered or LC domains, which have been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for binding of the PR n poly-dipeptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In the present study, we concentrated on the mechanism(s) by which the PR n poly-dipeptide might affect the transport of macromolecules into and out of the nucleus and thus lead to the disruption of normal cellular metabolism. Specifically, we show by super-resolution microscopy that a synthetic PR n poly-dipeptide, PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , binds to the central channel of the nuclear pore. Furthermore, PR 20 affects both import and export of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope under several experimental conditions, as would be expected if it interferes with normal functioning of the pore complex.</p><p>Both the localization of PR 20 and its interference with transport across the nuclear envelope suggest that proteins of the central channel might be targets of the peptide. These proteins (and other proteins of the nuclear pore complex) are rich in FG repeats, which are known to be involved in the transport process itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. For these reasons, we examined the interaction between PR 20 and purified FG repeats. We found that PR 20 did not bind to the unstructured monomeric form of FG repeats, but did bind to labile, amyloid-like FG polymers. Moreover, PR 20 binding was reversed when the amyloid-like fibers were melted by exposure to the aliphatic alcohol 1,6-HD.</p><p>The latter properties of labile, amyloid-like fibers formed from the FG domains of the Nup54 and Nup98 proteins are reminiscent of polymers formed from LC domains derived from RNA-binding proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. A prominent feature of the latter category of LC domains is repetitive occurrence of the tripeptide sequence glycine/serine-tyrosine-glycine/serine (G/S-Y-G/S). We predict that LC domains enriched in either FG or G/S-Y-G/S repeats may use similar structural features to enact their respective biological function. Both types of LC domains form labile polymers that are selectively sensitive to melting by 1,6-HD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, and both bind the toxic PR n poly-dipeptide in a polymer dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5 A-D</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. We speculate that iteratively exposed epitopes along the surface of both categories of LC domain polymers allow for Velcro-like interaction with the iterative PR repeats of the toxic PR n poly-dipeptide.</p><p>Another similarity shared by LC domains typified by either FG or G/S-Y-G/S repeats is their involvement in translocations causative of many different forms of cancer. The DNA sequences encoding FG domains of nucleoporins, or G/S-Y-G/S domains of certain RNA-binding proteins, when translocated onto sequences encoding any of various gene-specific DNA binding domains, form oncogenic fusion proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. In both cases, the FG and G/S-Y-G/S repeats function as potent transcriptional activation domains. Studies of fused in sarcoma (FUS) and TAF15 have provided evidence that their G/S-Y-G/S repeats must be capable of polymerization to function as transcriptional activation domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Whether FG domains, when translocated onto the DNAbinding domains of gene-specific transcription factors, function in a polymer-dependent manner remains to be tested.</p><p>Our results support a model in which the FG repeats of nuclear pore proteins exist in equilibrium between polymerized and unpolymerized states. The high concentration of FG domains within the central channel of nuclear pores, predicted to be in the range of 50 mM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, favors interprotein interactions. We emphasize that the proposed cross-β segments of FG repeats within nuclear pores are likely to be very short and dynamic, perhaps composed of only a handful of polymerized subunits. By binding to polymerized FG repeats and stabilizing them, the PR 20 peptide may shift the equilibrium toward the polymerized state, with consequent impediments to transport across the nuclear envelope. To this end, we make note of the findings of Freibaum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> showing that knockdown of the Nup98 protein suppresses the toxicity of the C9orf72 GGGGCC n repeat expansion, perhaps by loosening the permeability barrier of the central channel of the nuclear pore.</p><p>We further show that treatment of cells with the aliphatic alcohol 1,6-HD may enhance the movement of macromolecules through nuclear pores, perhaps by shifting the equilibrium toward the unstructured state of FG repeats. The effects of the PR 20 peptide and aliphatic alcohols represent extreme conditions; more subtle changes in the equilibrium between structured and unstructured FG repeats may regulate transport in living cells.</p></div>

A PR 20 peptide with an HA tag at the carboxyl terminus was synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. FITC and Atto-647 NHS ester were covalently conjugated to the amino terminus of glycine-PR 20 -HA peptide and purified by reverse-phase chromatography. Nuclear Envelope Preparation and Imaging. Nuclear envelope preparations were made from the giant oocyte nucleus of the frog X. laevis as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. Unfixed envelopes were treated for 20 min with 1 mg/mL nonhydrolyzable RanL43E-GTP, a kind gift from Shusheng Wang and Yixian Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. This treatment enhanced the binding of PR 20 peptide, but was not essential. Envelopes were then incubated in either 20 μM FITC-PR 20 or 1-5 μM Atto 647N-PR 20 in PBS for 1 h. The resulting preparations were fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde for 10 min before being mounted in ProLong Diamond mounting medium (Molecular Probes). For dual-color images, an antibody against nucleoporin gp210 was applied before the PR 20 peptide or Alexa Fluor 555-WGA (2 μg/mL). The anti-gp210 antibody was a kind gift from Georg Krohne <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.

X-Ray Diffraction of Nup Fibers. For X-ray diffraction, the Nup fiber samples were dialyzed twice in 1 L of Milli-Q water (EMD Millipore) for 12 h each time. The dialyzed samples were lyophilized overnight and then exposed to an X-ray beam to obtain cross-β diffraction as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>SDD-AGE. The stability of cross-β fibers of Nup proteins was tested by SDD-AGE as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. In brief, Nup fibers and amyloid fibers of yeast Sup35NM protein were diluted in a gelation buffer at 1 mg/mL and briefly sonicated. Sonicated fibers were incubated in gelation buffer containing different concentrations of SDS (0-2%, wt/vol) at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel to separate fibers and monomers. The agarose gel was then stained with Krypton Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) overnight and subsequently scanned with a fluorescent scanner (Typhoon 9200; GE Healthcare) to visualize the proteins. Scanned images were analyzed with ImageJ.</p><p>N-Acetylimidazole Acetylation Footprinting of Nup54 Fibers. These experiments were carried out in accordance with previously published protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Nup54 was expressed in E. coli and labeled with either light ( 12 C) or heavy ( 13 C) phenylalanine ( 13 C 6 ; labeled with 13  Nuclear Pore Permeability Assay. HeLa cells at near confluency were permeabilized with 0.005% digitonin (wt/vol) at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were exposed to buffer only containing 0.5 mg/mL of Texas Red-labeled 70 kDa dextran or to buffers containing an additional 7% (wt/vol) 1,6-HD or 2,5-HD. Permeabilized cells were also incubated with either 0.8 mg/mL WGA (Sigma-Aldrich) or 20 μM HA-PR 20 before being exposed to buffer containing dextran and 7% (wt/vol) 1,6-HD.
