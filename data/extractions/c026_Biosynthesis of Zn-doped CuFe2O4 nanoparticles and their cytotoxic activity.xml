The cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs were evaluated on macrophage normal cells and A549 lung cancer cells. The cytotoxic effects of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs on A549 cancer cell lines were analyzed. The Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs demonstrated IC 50 values 95.8 and 278.4 µg/mL on A549 cancer cell, respectively. Additionally, Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs had IC 80 values of 8.31 and 16.1 µg/mL on A549 cancer cell, respectively. Notably, doping Zn on CuFe 2 O 4 NPs displayed better cytotoxic effects on A549 cancer cells compared with the CuFe 2 O 4 NPs alone.

After complete dissolution of salts, the pH of the mixture was increased from 4 to 7 by adding NaOH 1 M under the same conditions. After that, 15 mL of deionized water was added dropwise to the mixture and sterilized continuously for 2 h at room temperature. The resulting mixture was transferred to an autoclave and placed in an oven at 170 °C for 13 h. The synthesized NPs were washed several times with deionized water.

XRD data of plant extract and nanostructures are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>. The presence of strong peaks in 2θ range 35.7°, 62.5°, and 39° confirmed the crystalline phases of copper-ferrite (CuFe 2 O 4 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101</ref> and zinc-doped copper ferrite (Zn doped CuFe 2 O 4 ) NPs in the synthesized NPs, respectively. The reflection planes 111 (18.5°), 220 (30°), 311 (35.7°), 400 (43°), 422 (53.5°), 511 (57°), 440 (62.5°), and 533 (72.5°) verified the spinel crystallites phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102</ref> of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104</ref> .</p><p>In the XRD pattern, the reflection (311) is the most intense peak.

The crystallite size was calculated as a function of Zn content x using Debye-Scherrer's formula (D = 0.9λ/β cos θ).

As a result, the crystallite size of NPs was found to be ~ 20 nm.</p><p>FTIR analysis of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs in the range of 300 to 4000 cm -1 with KBr pellet was performed by tensor II (Bruker Company, Germany) device.

According to the results obtained from anticancer tests, ZnO and CuO NPs exhibited an increased A549 cell mortality. However, CuO NPs had high toxicity on macrophages normal cells. In recent decades, the application of biogenic NPs together with the phenolic compounds of medicinal plants can be considered as an attractive alternative for the treatment of cancers.

Additionally, by increasing the phenolic compounds of Nasturtium extract, the antioxidant activity was enhanced with the lowest IC 50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">121</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 nanopowders were successfully synthesized in one step using Nasturtium plant extract. The NPs were characterized by XRD, FTIR, EDS, TGA, and SEM. The biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs were evaluated on macrophages cell Line. Additionally, the anticancer properties of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs against A549 lung cancer cells were evaluated. As a result, doping Zn on CuFe 2 O 4 NPs displayed better cytotoxic effects on A549 cancer cells compared with the CuFe 2 O 4 NPs alone. Also spinel crystallites of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 (~ 13 nm) had a minimum toxicity (CC 50 = 136.6 µg/mL) on macrophages J774 Cell Line. The Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 are multi-metallic with suitable applicability and biocompatibility, which should be further studied particularly for the treatment and diagnosis of cancers and infectious diseases. Additionally, these nanomaterials with unique optical and magnetic properties can be considered as attractive candidates for catalytic applications. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

SEM image with bright-field background demonstrated spherical NPs with size range less than 30 nm. In the EDS diagram, the elements of zinc, copper, iron, and oxygen are shown. The presence of Cu, Zn, Fe and O elements in EDS spectra confirmed the formation of deposited Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 spinel ferrite. The elemental composition of all samples was correlated to the stoichiometric theoretical composition of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 .Thermal analysis of not calcinated Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs was performed to investigate the formation of the spinel ferrite phase of the prepared spinel ferrite, as previously described<ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111</ref> . Changes in the physical behavior of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs were evaluated using TGA based on temperature and time using TG 209 F3Tarsus®, NETZSCH Germany Company device (Fig.4). TGA and DTA evaluations of the NPs were performed under N 2 atmosphere at the heating rate of 10 °C/min within the temperature range 25-800 °C. Weight loss at about 200 °C was attributed to the decomposition of metal hydroxide and the crystallization of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs<ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112</ref> .Anticancer properties ofZn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs. The cytotoxicity properties of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs were evaluated on macrophage normal cells and A549 lung cancer cells for 72 h, respectively. On the other hand, for better evaluation of anticancer effects of the components in Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 NPs, the aforementioned tests were performed on ZnO, CuO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs. Results obtained from cytotoxicity analysis of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 , ZnO, CuO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs on murine macrophages, with CC 50 values of 136.6, 762.36, 98.5, and 309.3 µg/mL, are shown in Fig. 5a, respectively. According to CC 50 values, Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 , ZnO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs displayed no significant cytotoxic effects against macrophage cells, but CuO NPs illustrated significant cytotoxic effects against normal macrophage cells. Based on our results, Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 , ZnO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs were safer for mammalian cells. According to the results, CuO NPs caused oxidative stress and genetic toxicity in mammalian normal cells 113,114 . The cytotoxic effects of Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 , ZnO, CuO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs exposed to 1-1000 µg/mL on A549 cancer cell lines are shown in Fig. 5b. The Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 , ZnO, CuO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs demonstrated IC 50 values 95.8, 113.1, 120.2, and 278.4 µg/mL on A549 cancer cell, respectively. Additionally, Zn-doped CuFe 2 O 4 , ZnO, CuO, and CuFe 2 O 4 NPs had IC 80 values of 8.31, 12.81, 8.7, and 16</figDesc></figure>
