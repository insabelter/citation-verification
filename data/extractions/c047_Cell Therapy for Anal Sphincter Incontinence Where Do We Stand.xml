<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Anal sphincter incontinence is a chronic disease, which dramatically impairs quality of life and induces high costs for the society. Surgery, considered as the best curative option, shows a disappointing success rate. Stem/progenitor cell therapy is pledging, for anal sphincter incontinence, a substitute to surgery with higher efficacy. However, the published literature is disparate. Our aim was to perform a review on the development of cell therapy for anal sphincter incontinence with critical analyses of its pitfalls. Animal models for anal sphincter incontinence were varied and tried to reproduce distinct clinical situations (acute injury or healed injury with or without surgical reconstruction) but were limited by anatomical considerations. Cell preparations used for treatment, originated, in order of frequency, from skeletal muscle, bone marrow or fat tissue. The characterization of these preparations was often incomplete and stemness not always addressed. Despite a lack of understanding of sphincter healing processes and the exact mechanism of action of cell preparations, this treatment was evaluated in 83 incontinent patients, reporting encouraging results. However, further development is necessary to establish the correct indications, to determine the most-suited cell type, to standardize the cell preparation method and to validate the route and number of cell delivery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Anal sphincter incontinence (ASI) is defined by an involuntary loss of gases, solids and/or liquid materials. The prevalence of ASI is widely underestimated and ranges from 0.4 to 24% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. ASI is an underrated pathology in regards to its morbidity and its impact on the society and is associated with impaired quality of life and psychopathologies such as depression, anxiety disorder and impaired sexual function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the USA, ASI's global cost has been estimated to be around 11 billion dollars per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The physiopathology of ASI is not completely understood but results from a functional impairment of one or more of the four anatomic components that allow a normal continence: The internal anal sphincter (IAS), the external anal sphincter (EAS), the pelvic floor muscles and the sensory-motor apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. ASI is primarily managed conservatively but sphincter repair surgery is proposed for large defects of either EAS, IAS or both with conservative treatment failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. However, long-term results of anal sphincter repair are unsatisfactory, notably regarding IAS repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Several strategies have been developed to improve sphincter repair surgery or to replace it without outstanding successes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Since more than a decade, the transplantation of stem cells (multipotent cells with limited proliferation ability) or progenitor cells (multipotent cells with limited proliferation ability) has been proposed as an adjunct or direct therapy for ASI following the hypothesis that transplanted cells will either commit differentiation into EAS or IAS muscle or produce growth factors that will favor sphincter healing (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>). A consensus among researchers was never reached, and various source cells and protocols have been proposed and investigated with preclinical and clinical studies. We present herein a critical analysis of cell therapy for ASI. Of note, as transplanted cells were heterogenous regarding their origin and phenotype, the generic term "multipotent cell" will be used to describe the transplanted cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Physiopathology of Anal Sphincter Injuries, Models and Cell Therapy-Based Strategies 2.1. Mechanisms of Sphincter Injuries</head><p>In patients with ASI, there are at least two mechanisms leading to a modification in the pelvic floor structure or function. First, sphincters can be injured by perineal tearing, stretching and/or ischemia; obstetric trauma being the most common cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The episiotomy procedure is also associated with anal incontinence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A second mechanism involves the degeneration of pelvic floor muscles, which appears with ageing, but rapidly after menopause as pelvic floor structures are hormone responsive <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Proposed animal models of anal incontinence tried to simulate distinct clinical situations where continence is impaired by an acute or chronic mechanism. In these models, various methods were used to harm these structures, including muscle section or excision, thermal injury and even nerve crushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, these experimental models of ASI do not consider the stretching effect of pelvic floor that can occur during childbirth. Thus, some authors have proposed a more realistic rodent model of childbirth injury by means of a balloon inflated in the vagina for a prolonged time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. This model was, however, never used to assess the potential of cell therapy to cure ASI.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> Rabbit, NHP 50% excision of ventral portion of anal sphincter IAS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Acute Anal Sphincter Injury and Healing</head><p>The classical clinical situation of acute anal sphincter injury is well illustrated by childbirth trauma, which still occurs in 11% of vaginal deliveries and can extend up to the IAS and sometimes the rectum (starting from posterior wall of vagina) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In the case of extending traumatism to the level of rectal wall, dedicated stem cells of the anal canal transition zone, positive for cytokeratin 17, participate in the healing process of the mucosa of the rectum and the anal canal <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. On the other hand, the healing process of anal sphincters has not been thoroughly studied and it is supposed to be very similar to other muscle-healing processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Under optimal conditions, healing ultimately leads to the generation of new myofibers/smooth muscle cells from muscle satellite cells/progenitor smooth muscle cells or the reparation of damaged myofibers after fusion with muscle satellite cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. After anal sphincter injury, it is thought that inflammatory cells' cross-talk produces cytokines and growth factors that will recruit stem cells and progenitor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. These cells could be mobilized from bone marrow or the surrounding tissues and might favor healing, be incorporated into the wound or further recruit stem cells and progenitor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Especially, skeletal muscle satellite cells, which are localized in periphery of myofibers, near vascular or nerve structures, are a source of myoblasts and, further, new myocytes after their activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. However, Lorenzi et al. reported in rats, after direct anal sphincter injury and repair, the persistence of fibrous tissue with dilated blood vessels and muscle cell degeneration patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Progenitor cells produce cytokines like stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) that are both chemoattractive for progenitor cells (including myoblasts and smooth muscle progenitor  <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. (A): The tear will induce a phase of inflammation where polymorphonuclear cells are attracted in the first hour and are responsible to maintain the function of macrophages that will arrive later. At the same time, platelets recruitment following the rupture of small vessels induces the releasee of SDF-1 following their degranulation. SDF-1 is primordial for anal sphincter regeneration and acts by attracting non-resident progenitor cells, myoblasts and smooth-muscle progenitors to the wound and by promoting the survival, migration and proliferation of these cells. (B): Macrophages of M1 (CD68 + ) polarity arrives after the polymorphonuclear cells and largely contribute to the acute inflammation phase. (C): During the healing phase, activated satellite cells contribute to new muscle formation (black arrows) and each step is characterized by a specific hallmark protein expression (blue boxes). Then, macrophage polarity switches to M2 (CD163 + ) and they produce cytokines such as Il-10 helping proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. (D): During the healing phase, different kinds of non-myogenic local progenitor cells are activated, and some of them, like the fibro-adipogenic progenitors, are conditioned by the presence of IL-4 secreted by eosinophils, with this pathway being necessary for skeletal muscle regeneration. Non-myogenic local progenitor cells interplay indirectly by the production of cytokines like FGF-2 and IGF-1 but can also fuse (camel arrows) with other nonmyogenic local progenitor cells, satellite cells, myoblasts or even myofibers, inducing hypertrophy. Finally, in case of damage to the rectal wall mucosa, local stem cells of the anal transition zone contribute to the reparation of the rectum and anal transition zone mucosa. qSC: Quiescent satellite cell, aSC: Activated satellite cell, SMC: Smooth muscle cell, pSMC: Progenitor smooth muscle cell. ATZ: Anal transition zone.</p><p>Progenitor cells produce cytokines like stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) that are both chemoattractive for progenitor cells (including myoblasts and smooth muscle progenitor cells) but also contribute to cell proliferation, migration and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. SDF-1 seems to be a prominent cytokine for anal sphincter healing. Salcedo et al. reported a rapid local burst of SDF-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3) expression in rats one hour after sphincter injury and up to 21 days after injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Moreover, an injection of plasmids with SDF-1 directly into EAS muscle or transplantation of SDF-1 transfected progenitor cells both improved continence in rodents after partial sphincterectomy with the same extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p>In theory, progenitor cells could be transplanted soon after injury and this is considered to be the best option to maximize the effect of transplantation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Indeed, it is supposed that progenitor cells might increase the natural healing process notably through the local release of cytokines such as SDF-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. This strategy was evaluated in several preclinical studies where progenitor cells were either directly injected after injury with surgical reparation, or not, to mimic the situation of a direct repair of sphincters <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Of note, some authors delayed this intervention by 24 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, progenitor cells have never been injected in a patient with acute anal sphincter injury.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Unrepaired Anal Sphincter Injury</head><p>Most often, an anal sphincter tear is usually identified after delivery and surgically repaired <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Sometimes, the diagnosis can be missed, resulting in an occult anal sphincter injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. As for an acute anal injury, little is known about the long-term healing and remodeling of damaged muscle, and an analogy can be made with the repair processes of skeletal and smooth muscles from other localizations (cf. Section 2.2). Probably, some unrepaired anal sphincter lesions could spontaneously heal. There exists evidence that a clear cut through anal sphincters in rats can heal spontaneously without inducing ASI <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. As a result, almost all models of ASI in rats imply the partial resection of anal sphincters. In rat models where simple anal sphincters section were performed, acute and chronic inflammation was seen at the site of injury, characterized by neutrophils, monocytes macrophages infiltrations and fibrous tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, disorganization of striated fibers of the EAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, but also mucin pool inclusions with histiocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In rabbits, Rajasekaran investigated the effects of an EAS clear-cut section over time. The authors reported early collagen deposits from one week after injury, but also extensive fibrosis appearing three weeks after injury, at the site of myotomy but also beyond <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The presence of fibrosis was confirmed by other authors in rabbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. In dogs, three weeks after IAS and EAS partial excision, Kang et al. reported focal interstitial inflammation, fibrosis and atrophy of smooth and striated muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Anal sphincters encircle the anal canal, and the loss of this circular shape, as a result of injury, directly impairs the continence function <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. However, during sphincter repair surgery, one can observe that the retracted muscle edges are held together with fibrous tissue, which bridges the defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Thus, unrepaired damage to IAS or EAS does not evolve into a hole in the sphincter ring (EAS and/or IAS), but rather into altered tissue, which fills the breach. In rats, this tissue contained mast cells and other inflammatory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the importance of this tissue was never investigated in humans but could be of importance, especially if the muscle gap is the target of cell therapy. </p></div>

In rabbits, Rajasekaran investigated the effects of an EAS clear-cut section over time. The authors reported early collagen deposits from one week after injury, but also extensive fibrosis In the majority of preclinical studies, researchers investigated the direct injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the area of muscle injury (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). This approach could be wrong as recent evidence stated that the transplantation of stem cells of mesenchymal origin during the late phase of healing can be deleterious and increase fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Surprisingly, in the majority of fundamental studies modeling anal injury, the recovery time before cell therapy was very short (days) whereas after sphincter injury, ASI appears years or even decades after the initial trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Therefore, future models should also consider a realistic healing time after anal sphincter injury before applying cell therapy. Indeed, trials with patients suffering from long-lasting ASI with EAS lesions have investigated the direct injection of multipotent cells into EAS lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, muscle edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> or entire muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</p><p>Another strategy to treat patients with ASI is the transplantation of a biosphincter. Bitar's group, from the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, has been working for decades on the implantation of bioengineered anal sphincters composed of innervated smooth muscle cells (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>). The results are promising and the group recently implanted the construct in large animals, including non-human primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. This strategy is interesting as it provides a complete and functional IAS substitute and might be part of a reconstruction strategy for patients in whom IAS has been totally or partially removed such as for ultra-low rectal cancer resections. However, IAS engineering has some hurdles to overcome. First, this approach uses IAS or digestive smooth muscle cells and intestinal neuronal cells. For translation to the clinic, tissue might be procured from organ donors, requiring further immunosuppression and exposing patients to its associated risks. Those risks need to be balanced with the fact that ASI is a non-life-threatening condition. Moreover, Araki et al. recently demonstrated the feasibility of anorectal transplantation in a dog model, with this approach being serious concurrent to allogenic biosphincters <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Further, the tissue culture of such constructs requires 6 to 8 weeks of culture, which increases the risk of microbial contamination. Finally, the cost of the creation of an organic construct seems to be higher than cell isolation and expansion.</p></div>

Park's sphincteroplasty is the most common procedure where the two edges of the damaged sphincters are brought together with an overlapping suture <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Usually, the surrounding fibrous tissue, which also connects the retracted muscle, is not dissected as it offers a firm support for knotting <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the healing of such a delayed repair has never been investigated. Due to the poor long-term results of sphincteroplasty, the idea to strengthen the reparation with multipotent cells has emerged. As mentioned above, in preclinical studies, some authors injected multipotent cells during sphincter repair surgery but this was never done after secondary repair in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. However, Sarveazad et al. successfully and safely injected adipose tissue-derived multipotent cells after EAS sphincteroplasty in five women and two men (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Chronic Anal Sphincter Impairment</head><p>In some patients with ASI, a clear injury event cannot be found, and patients have either weak anal sphincter tonus without an anomaly on imaging or hypotrophy of anal sphincters on imaging. This could be the result of aging, denervation or degenerative mechanisms inducing a chronic injury to the anal sphincters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. IAS is responsible for the anal sphincter basal tone and contributes to up to 85% of the pressure necessary to keep the anal canal closed <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Indeed, IAS basal tonus is maintained without neural stimulus by the high expression of proteins inducing contractility in the IAS smooth muscle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. A high content of smooth muscle actin and myosin isoforms has been reported in IAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, but spontaneous contraction property is driven by the continuous phosphorylation of myosin light chain by protein kinase C (PKC) and Rho kinase systems; indeed proteins of these cascades, such as PKCα, RhoA, CPI-17 and HSP27 were prominent in human IAS smooth muscle cells compared to smooth muscle cells sampled from a human colon used as a control <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Specifically, it was demonstrated in humans that the RhoA/ROCK system is the main effector of the IAS basal tone and is constitutively activated by the renin-angiotensin system and arachidonic acid products <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. On the other hand, IAS non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves negatively regulate the basal tone, essentially through nitric oxide (NO), which is the main neurotransmitter negatively affecting IAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated in rats that RhoA/ROCK system proteins were the target of microRNA, which were reducing the IAS basal tone by a diminution of the expression of components necessary for signal transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Particularly, micro-RNA-133a was increased with aging in rats and might partially explain the degeneration of IAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Other effects of aging, observed in colon smooth muscle cells, could also be present in IAS, including a diminution of RhoA translocation, a diminution in the association of the pairs actin/myosin and tropomyosin/HSP27 and a decrease in the phosphorylation of HSP27 <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. These elements could partially explain the weakness of anal sphincters seen in older people.</p><p>Diabetes has been associated with ASI <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> and may affect anal sphincters from the cellular to the nervous level <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. However, the precise mechanism of diabetes on anorectal function has been poorly investigated. At the cellular level, the expression of miRNA-133, linked to IAS degeneration, was also increased in diabetic rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Diabetic neuropathy affects gastrointestinal motility <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> and measures of anal function in diabetic patients showed a reduction of maximal squeeze pressure (which is a reflection of EAS function) in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Furthermore, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease are more prone to report ASI. There is probably an overlap between the alteration in bowel motility, the decrease in rectal compliance due to rectum inflammation and the sequel of repeated anal fistula surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. However, further investigation of muscle alteration during inflammatory bowel disease has never been carried out.</p><p>To date, there is unfortunately no model mimicking a degeneration of the muscles of EAS or IAS. Hosokawa et al. proposed a model of EAS and IAS injury using cardiotoxin but the injury was finally similar to sphincter resection <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. This model was never used to assess cell therapy efficacity/efficiency.</p></div>

Bioengineered constructs used smooth muscle seeded with neuronal cells from different origins. Finally, only one publication evaluated the potential of human umbilical cord matrix cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Skeletal muscle-derived cells seem to be an interesting source for ASI therapy. Different multipotent cells can be extracted from skeletal muscle: Satellite cells and other resident multipotent cells, the former having the ability to become new satellite cells or myoblasts, the precursors of myocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. Thurner et al. demonstrated that smooth muscle cells can eventually be derived from myogenic progenitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>. The function of other muscle resident multipotent cells is not completely understood and this category encompasses different kinds of multipotent cells such as adult pericytes, PW1+ interstitial cells and fibro-adipogenic progenitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>Satellite cells have the ability to reform muscle fiber <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> and have been proposed to treat conditions such as Duchenne disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, coronary artery disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> and also urinary incontinence <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. It is supposed that skeletal muscle multipotent cells differentiated into new myocyte and could resupply EAS with new fibers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Indeed, the apparition of new fibers in EAS and the expression of muscle proteins have been observed by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr">92]</ref>. However, the appearance of new muscle fibers does not necessarily indicate that anal function is improved. In this regard, several in vivo studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> using myogenic cells were inconclusive concerning anal function recovery despite cell engraftment confirmation.</p><p>Cells derived from adipose tissue constitute an interesting option, as subcutaneous fat tissue is easily accessible. The cells used in the reported studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref> had the characteristics of MSC including the ability to differentiate into various tissues. MSC are multipotent cells that have been evaluated over the last years to treat various conditions including spinal cord injury, corneal or uvea injury, lung injury, cerebral injury, colitis, alopecia, muscular degenerative disease, myocardial infarction, liver injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, cancer and to improve wound healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. Indeed, allogeneic adipose tissue MSCs became popular because of their poor immunogenicity and their availability after liposuction surgery. However, recent evidence demonstrated the development of donor-specific antibodies, and MSC rejection has been documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. Besides MSC's ability to differentiate into various cells, their paracrine action have been proposed to mediate most of their effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112]</ref>. MSC produce a large amount of growth factors and extracellular vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. Strategies using encapsulated MSC conserve the effects of MSC, notably on liver fibrosis, confirming the efficacy of paracrine action and treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Thus, MSC can be seen as in situ bioreactors delivering growth factors to neighboring cells. MSC have the ability to induce smooth muscle regeneration from the gut and the bladder <ref type="bibr">[115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">116]</ref> and also skeletal muscle regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref>. Thus, MSC therapy may promote the healing and regeneration of both IAS and EAS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Practical Considerations</head><p>Before transplantation, cells were cultivated on plastic dishes and the number of passages before injection in the identified clinical trials ranged from three to ten.

However, the minimum number of cells required to obtain a beneficial effect on ASI remains elusive and only a few authors performed a real titration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr">92]</ref>. Thus, an excess of cells was used to compensate stem cell and progenitor cell death. Transplanted cell survival is a main concern in the field of cell therapy and it can be impaired by several factors related to the mechanical force applied during cell application, detachment from cell substrate and receiving site with inflammation and/or local hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. Indeed, forces generated during injection with a syringe needle are sufficient to induce up to 40% of cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>.

A total of 83 patients received cell therapy for ASI treatment.</p><p>Almost all patients included in clinical trials exhibited EAS injury. Four out of seven studies used the Wexner score as the primary outcome. The FIQL score was used in two studies. Other variables measured were anorectal manometry (5/7), endoanal ultrasonography (3/7) and electromyography (EMG) (3/7). The longest follow-up was reported by the group of Frudinger et al. who injected autologous myoblasts into EAS in 10 voluntary women with EAS defect or atrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. After a follow-up of 5 years, the mean Wexner score decreased from 15.3 (SD-2.4) before intervention to 0.7 (SD 1.3) (p &gt; 0.001). In addition, anal manometry demonstrated an improvement of median resting and squeeze pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> to 32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref> and 23 (IQR 20-34) to 33 (IQR 31-66), respectively). The same group started a second trial including 34 females and 5 males and found a reduction of Wexner score of -16.2 (SD-3.66) for women and -18.8 (SD-1.30) for male at one year. These results were better than sphincteroplasty, which typically induces a long-term reduction of -1 to -5.2 of median/mean Wexner score (mean follow-up between seven and eight years) <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref>. In a similar study (muscle tissue-derived multipotent cells injected into EAS), Boyer et al. reported a reduction of median Wexner score of -6.4 (range -12 to 2) (p = 0.006) for the intervention group and a reduction of -1 (range -8 to 6) (p = 0.35) for the placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. However, using adipose tissue-derived multipotent cells in a randomized triple blinded placebo-controlled trial, De la Portilla et al. failed to demonstrate any effect on Wexner score of cell transplantation into EAS defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Globally, all seven reports described encouraging results regarding at least one of the measured outcomes (which was not necessary the primary outcome).</p><p>Until now, in vivo experiments have demonstrated a relative oncological safety of such a strategy. One in vivo study described focal cell growth at the injection site but without malignant characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Recent evidence confirmed that pure stem cell cultures, particularly MSC, did not develop malignant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129]</ref>. However, MSC have opposite effects on tumor cells and can promote or suppress tumor growth in vitro and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. Published clinical trials, which used either skeletal muscle tissue or adipose tissue multipotent cells, demonstrated that the procedures were safe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the safety of multipotent cell utilization for ASI. Published clinical studies have shown promising results, but only three of them were controlled with placebo injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. These controlled studies had relative short follow-ups considering that ASI is a disease evolving over time. Thus, all the presented strategies for cell therapy in the context of ASI deserve further randomized controlled trials with improved methodology regarding outcome measurement and follow-up.</p><p>The ideal therapy for ASI should be cost-effective with a long-lasting effect. Apart from research and development costs, good manufacturing practices, GMP certifications and implementation charges, routine use of cell therapy appears to be highly costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>. Trébol et al. estimated the maximal production costs in Spain to be 7400 USD for 40 million autologous fat-derived cells or 8500 € for 100 million allogeneic fat-derived cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. In our hospital, the cost for a sphincteroplasty, with a typical length of stay of two days, is 5000 USD. Recently, Gräs et al. proposed a cost-effective alternative to cell transplantation for anal sphincter regeneration. Following promising results for urinary incontinence, the authors discussed the possibility to inject fragmented muscle fibers, instead of expanded cells, into injured anal sphincters <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>.</p><p>After transplantation, progenitor cells and stem cells might act by paracrine effects and/or by differentiation into functional muscular cells. It should be pointed out that the exact underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, and that basic research on this topic is still required to understand which factors and conditions are leading to cell engraftment, differentiation and finally tissue regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132]</ref>. Moreover, the natural history of sphincter lesion/repaired sphincter healing should be better understood in order to select appropriate cell preparations and transplantation techniques. Some groups reported a different approach, considering the use of cell therapy as an add-on to sphincter repair, either directly after lesion, to simulate the primary repair of an acute obstetrical tear or at distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Thus, it remains to be determined how stem cells and progenitor cells should be used for ASI: As a substitution to surgery or along with surgery.</p></div>

(A) The tear will induce a phase of inflammation where polymorphonuclear cells are attracted in the first hour and are responsible to maintain the function of macrophages that will arrive later. At the same time, platelets recruitment following the rupture of small vessels induces the releasee of SDF-1 following their degranulation. SDF-1 is primordial for anal sphincter regeneration and acts by attracting non-resident progenitor cells, myoblasts and smooth-muscle progenitors to the wound and by promoting the survival, migration and proliferation of these cells. (B) Macrophages of M1 (CD68 + ) polarity arrives after the polymorphonuclear cells and largely contribute to the acute inflammation phase. (C) During the healing phase, activated satellite cells contribute to new muscle formation (black arrows) and each step is characterized by a specific hallmark protein expression (blue boxes). Then, macrophage polarity switches to M2 (CD163 + ) and they produce cytokines such as Il-10 helping proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. (D) During the healing phase, different kinds of non-myogenic local progenitor cells are activated, and some of them, like the fibro-adipogenic progenitors, are conditioned by the presence of IL-4 secreted by eosinophils, with this pathway being necessary for skeletal muscle regeneration. Non-myogenic local progenitor cells interplay indirectly by the production of cytokines like FGF-2 and IGF-1 but can also fuse (camel arrows) with other non-myogenic local progenitor cells, satellite cells, myoblasts or even myofibers, inducing hypertrophy. Finally, in case of damage to the rectal wall mucosa, local stem cells of the anal transition zone contribute to the reparation of the rectum and anal transition zone mucosa. qSC: Quiescent satellite cell, aSC: Activated satellite cell, SMC: Smooth muscle cell, pSMC: Progenitor smooth muscle cell.
