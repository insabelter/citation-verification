<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to improve the accuracy of power load forecasting and deal with the challenge of insufficient stand-alone computing resources brought by the intelligent power system, data extraction algorithms are used in energy market analysis. Preliminary weather performance algorithms are optimized online based on the nature of the power load data. In order to improve the accuracy of the computational algorithms, the concept of classification and various agents was introduced. *e MapReduce cloud computing programming framework is used simultaneously to improve design algorithms to improve the ability to process large amounts of data. *e actual electronic data provided by EUNITE was selected as a sample analysis and a complete experiment of the 32-node cloud computing group. *e results of the experiment show that the load data provided by EUNITE was expanded into four different data sets: 1000 times, 2000 times, 4000 times, and 8000 times. Works on older data and the cloud. Platforms with groups of 4, 8, 16, and 32 nodes are designed to calculate acceleration ratios and scale speeds. *e acceleration ratio of a perfectly parallel system algorithm can reach 1. However, in practical applications, as the number of cluster nodes increases, so does the transmission cost of the node network. Conclusions. Accuracy assumptions based on this model are better than the general evaluation of supported vector regression prediction algorithms and neural network algorithms, and the planning process is well underway.</p></div>

Nowadays, information technology is so advanced that the use of these data resources provides technical support. People also try to find the possible internal laws from these data resources. If appropriate information technology is adopted to process these data, power enterprises can better serve people. Electric power is an industry related to national economy and people's livelihood. *e quality of its service greatly affects people's quality of life. *e data could also help power companies cut costs and boost profits. By studying the law of market change, China's electric power enterprises represented by State Grid Corporation are implementing informatization <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. It also includes research on how to extract useful information from this vast amount of data through effective information technology. China is now a socialist market economy; the power enterprise information is also to serve the market economy. How to make the power enterprises and customers between the win-win is the problem that China's power enterprises face. *e market orientation replaces the original production orientation, improves efficiency and reduces costs internally, improves service level externally, and expands the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. *erefore, it puts forward new requirements for the functions of electric power marketing system of enterprises. Electric power industry is a basic industry, which affects all sectors of society.

Demand forecasting is a key component of electric power marketing system. *e forecast of electricity demand plays a key role in the construction of electric power facilities, the formulation of electric power marketing strategy, and the decision and subordinate of electric power production schedule tracking.

Under the massive high-dimensional data load prediction, a single machine cannot bear such a huge consumption of computing resources. In recent years, the popular large data processing technology is an effective method to solve this problem, and the algorithm parallelization caused by it has become a research direction of load forecasting in recent years. In this article, an extreme learning machine power load prediction algorithm based on cloud computing is proposed, which can not only shorten the training time and reduce the consumption of computing resources but also significantly improve the accuracy of power load.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 ) 1 :( 1 )</head><label>211</label><figDesc>Detailed Steps of MR-OSELM-WA Algorithm. *e main idea of the MapReduce programming framework is to use the parallel structure by writing the corresponding text and Reduce functions. *e average results of the MR-OSELM-WA algorithm are stored in the HBase data distribution and distribution cache. *e distributed MR-OSELM-WA prediction and decision model based on MapReduce is shown in Figure Large instructional packages can be read from the data distribution on the cloud computing platform, and different learning sessions can be obtained by segmenting training packages through a simple process of the MapReduce programming system [18]. Number is the number of map locations in a cloud group. (2) Subpackage training is taught in according to the step logic of the map function, such as the logic of OS-ELM training machine learning algorithm, which is equivalent to machine training which is different. (3) *e benefits of working in the diagram, which is an estimate of the importance of different training systems, were passed from the Shuffle phase of the MapReduce programming frame to the Reduced phase, and the weight of the estimated values generated by the MapReduce function was determined accordingly. According to the above weight calculation method, the predicted value weight of each Map operation output is determined, and then the final predicted value is calculated. (4) Learn the routine procedure for estimating average and long-term loads along the specified axis, slide as required, and return to step 1. Estimate the next day behind the load data on a regular basis.</figDesc></figure>

Finally, a new pair of averages (Key, Value) is created. (3) Competition. At this stage, it takes more time to convert a mean-value pair from a Map node to a Reduced node, depending on bandwidth and CPU speed, rather than Map and Reduce. At this stage, the intermediate values corresponding to the same average concept are combined and generated (main, list of results), and the values are determined. (4) Reduction.
