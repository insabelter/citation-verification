<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Comprising abundant interfaces, multicomponent heterostructures can integrate distinct building blocks into single entities and yield exceptional functionalities enabled by the synergistic components. Here we report an efficient approach to construct one-dimensional metal/sulfide heterostructures by directly sulfuring highly composition-segregated platinumnickel nanowires. The heterostructures possess a high density of interfaces between platinum-nickel and nickel sulfide components, which cooperate synergistically towards alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The platinum-nickel/nickel sulfide heterostructures can deliver a current density of 37.2 mA cm À 2 at an overpotential of 70 mV, which is 9.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H</head><p>ydrogen (H 2 ), as a clean and renewable energy resource, has been considered as a promising alternative to replace the diminishing fossil fuel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . The grand challenge leading to extensive use of hydrogen energy system is to produce H 2 in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

In general, HER is believed to consist of two pathways: Volmer/Tafel pathway or Volmer/Heyrovsky pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . However, the Heyrovsky and the Volmer steps have different expressions in acidic or basic media <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . The reacting species are H 2 O/OH À in the base solution and H þ in the acid solution; thus, the cleavage of HO-H bond in H 2 O is crucial for alkaline HER <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . To date, platinum (Pt) is generally considered as one of the best catalysts towards HER, particularly in acid media <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . However, the HER kinetics of Pt is much slower in the alkaline condition, resulting in the HER activity that is approximately two to three orders of magnitude lower than in the acidic media <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . This may be attributed to the fact that although Pt is conducive to the adsorption of reactive hydrogen intermediates (H ads ) and their combination into H 2 molecules, it is unfortunately not efficient in splitting water into H ads in the alkaline solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . The slow kinetics in the alkaline solution leads to low efficiencies in both water-alkali and chlor-alkali electrolysers. Therefore, introducing 'promoters' with the function to cleave HO-H bonds could open new opportunities to further enhance alkaline HER electrocatalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . However, which 'promoter' can work well with Pt to yield more efficient and durable HER catalysts remains an open question.</p><p>Owing to intrinsic difference in the chemical reactivity of the metallic components, bimetallic nanocrystals with high composition segregation are exploited to develop unusual nanostructures with desirable functionalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> .

Herein, we take the advantage of the highly composition-segregated Pt-Ni nanowires (NWs), to create a class of Pt 3 Ni/NiS heterostructures via a simple yet efficient sulfuration process. The Pt 3 Ni/NiS heterostructures with a high density of interfaces between NiS and Pt 3 Ni display excellent HER activity in both acidic and alkaline conditions. Specially, the optimized Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C yield the highest activity in the alkaline condition with a current density of 37.2 mA cm À 2 at an overpotential of 70 mV, which is 9.7 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, representing the best electrocatalysts towards alkaline HER, to the best of our knowledge. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergy between NiS and Pt 3 Ni components can substantially enhance the HER activity in the alkaline solution with NiS promoting water dissociation, whereas Pt 3 Ni efficiently convert H þ to H 2 . Moreover, these heterostructures also exhibit enhanced HER stability with limited activity decay after a long-term chronopotentiometry run. The unprecedented catalytic performance offered by the novel Pt 3 Ni/ NiS heterostructures highlights the importance of interfacial engineering in multicomponent electrocatalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Synthesis and characterization of PtNi/NiS NWs. A two-step procedure was used to make the unusual Pt 3 Ni/NiS heterostructures through first making the highly composition-segregated Pt-Ni NWs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and then reacting them with sulfur in oleylamine (OAm) at high temperature. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the pristine Pt-Ni NWs before sulfuration, where abundant of NWs was observed. Through tuning the amounts of Ni(acac) 2 and Pt(acac) 2 precursors, the molar ratio of Pt to Ni in Pt-Ni NWs can be easily tuned from 3:1 to 3:2, 3:3 and 3:4, determined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The unique part for the composition tuning in Pt-Ni NWs is that with the Ni increasing, the Pt-Ni NWs become coarser and the composition-segregation features are more obvious, confirmed by both TEM images and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>The highly composition-segregated Pt-Ni NWs were then subjected to sulfuration at high temperature (see details in Methods), as schematically illustrated in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>  The HAADF elemental mappings of Pt-Ni NWs-S shows that, although the distribution of Pt is mainly located at the interior of NWs, Ni and S evenly distribute throughout the whole NWs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>,f,i,l). This result suggests that the segregated Ni in Pt-Ni NWs could be very reactive and react with the added sulfur powder to in situ produce NiS on the surface. In details, the high reactivity of Ni with S would drive the oxidized Ni 2 þ outward due to highly composition-segregated feature of the pristine Pt-Ni NWs. Once the interior Ni species diffuse outward, they would be captured by S species to form NiS around the NWs immediately. The successful sulfuration of Pt-Ni NWs is also confirmed by the SEM-EDS, where the S signal in Pt-Ni NWs-S is evident and the sulfuration degree increases with the increase of Ni in Pt-Ni NWs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). In addition, the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) result (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) reveal that the Pt/Ni ratios of Pt-Ni NWs after the sulfuration are similar to those of the pristine Pt-Ni NWs.</p><p>The high-resolution TEM were further carried out to characterize the surface structures and interfaces between Pt-Ni NWs and NiS (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a-c</ref>). From the Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, the NiS nanocrystals grown on the surface of Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs-S exhibit an intimate contact between Pt 3 Ni and NiS, forming a unique Pt 3 Ni/NiS interface. Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>,c display the magnified image recorded from region b and c marked in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, where the lattice fringes with interplanar spacings are 0.22 and 0.295 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of Pt 3 Ni and (100) plane of NiS, respectively. XRD analysis of Pt-Ni NWs and Pt-Ni NWs-S was used to further confirm the phase transformation after the sulfuration (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>). It is found that the Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs have a shoulder peak between 40.5°and 43.5°due to the highly composition-segregated feature of Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs. After the sulfuration, the shoulder peak disappears associated with the formation of a symmetrical peak, which matches well with the fcc Pt 3 Ni phase in previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and alloyed fcc Pt 3 Co (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>, JCPDS No. 29-0499). Moreover, the weak diffraction peaks of NiS are also observed in the XRD pattern of Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs-S, which can be ascribed to the low crystalline feature of the NiS domains (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Therefore, all the above results clearly indicate the transformation of the pristine Pt-Ni NWs into Pt 3 Ni/NiS heterostructures by the sulfuration process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also used to trace the chemical states of different elements after the sulfuration (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e-g</ref>). To be specific, the broad S 2p XPS peak is fitted into four peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>). The peaks located at 161.5 and 162.4 eV are attributed to the S 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 orbitals of divalent sulfide (S 2 À ), respectively. The peak centred at 162.7 and 163.8 eV suggests the existence of bridging S 2 2 À (ref. 34). The ratio of S 2 À / S 2 2 À , calculated into 0.73/1, means that the S 2 À and S 2 2 À are co-existed in nickel sulfide. For the simplification, we use NiS to denote the nickel sulfide herein. Figure <ref type="figure">2f</ref>  Owing to the unexpected activity enhancement of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C for HER at pH 14, it stimulated us to explore whether it is also effective in other pH conditions. To this end, we carried out the detailed HER measurements in pH of 13 (0.1 M KOH), pH of 1 (0.05 M H 2 SO 4 ) and pH of 0 (0.5 M H 2 SO 4 ), respectively. The results show that the Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C still exhibits the best HER activity among three catalysts. However, the overall activity enhancement at pH 13 is much lower than that at pH 14, suggesting that the Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C is more susceptible at higher alkaline condition. The HER activities of Pt-Ni NWs-S/C in acidic media are also displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, respectively. Similarly, the Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C also display the best activity, but it is only slightly better than commercial Pt/C. To make a quantitative activity comparison, the current densities of Pt  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>), we can find that the HER activity difference of Pt-Ni NWs-S/C is more significant in alkaline condition and the activity of Pt-Ni NWs-S is more susceptible at higher alkaline condition. For this point, we 0 pH 14 -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.02 -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.02 -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.02 -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.02 -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.02 suppose that it might relate to the concentration of K þ and the unique heterostructure between Pt 3 Ni NWs and NiS. As demonstrated by Subbaraman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , the presence of hydrated cations in the vicinity of the Pt-Ni(OH) 2 interfaces can interact with water molecules and alter the orientation of water through non-covalent interaction of Ni(OH) 2 -Li þ -OH-H, which enhance the generation of hydrogen intermediates and thus result in the improvement of HER activity. As similar interaction of NiS-K þ -OH-H could happen in the vicinity of Pt-Ni NWs-S, the higher HER activity of Pt-Ni NWs-S in pH of 14 than in pH of 13 can be partially ascribed to the increased concentration of K þ . Such hypothesis has been confirmed experimentally, where in the pH of 13, the HER activity of Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs-S increases with the addition of K þ (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">18</ref>). The HER activities with insulation resistance compensation at pH 13 and pH 14 were further obtained and compared with various reported results (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). It is found that Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C exhibits the highest activity of 37.2 and 20.2 mA cm À 2 at pH 14 and 13 at À 0.07 V among all different catalysts, respectively, 9.7 times and 2.4 times higher than those of the commercial Pt/C (3.82 mA cm À 2 at pH 14 and 8.41 mA cm À 2 at pH 13), also representing the highest alkaline HER activity among all the previously reported catalysts. HER stability of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C was tested using chronopotentiometry technique and further compared with the commercial Pt/C. Figure <ref type="figure">4e</ref> shows the chronopotentiometric curves of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C and Pt/C at a current density of 5 mA cm À 2 at pH 13. It shows that Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C display the long-term stability without obvious potential shift. The stability of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C at pH of 14 were also tested (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f</ref>). We can see that the HER activity loss of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C is less than that of Pt/C. The TEM images of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C after 5 h chronopotentiometry test shows that the interfaces of Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C can be largely maintained (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>), whereas the Pt/C has obvious agglomeration (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref>). Moreover, the SEM-EDS and XPS (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) results reveal that the atomic ratio of Ni to S in Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S/C shows almost no change after stability test. Even after the chronopotentiometry tests at very high current density and longer time, the content of S and Ni could be largely maintained (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>), further confirming the good stability of the Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S likely to be due to its larger nanostructure than that of Pt nanoparticles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here we propose that the synergy between the Pt 3 Ni and NiS components is the main factor in enhancing the alkaline HER activity. To be specific, the H 2 O in basic media would adsorb electron to be dissociated into intermediate H ads and OH À by NiS through the Volmer step. Owing to the unfilled d orbitals of Ni 2 þ , the NiS can also immobilize the OH À by the stronger electrostatic affinity to avoid the OH À block the active site of Pt.</p><p>The generated H ads would be adsorbed on a nearby empty Pt site and further be converted into H 2 readily through the Tafel step or Heyrovsky step. To examine how the individual components of NiS/Pt 3 Ni cooperate synergistically to enhance alkaline HER activity, we performed DFT calculations for the key reaction steps in alkaline HER, including the water dissociation reaction and the adsorption/combination of reactive hydrogen intermediates (H ads ). For HER in alkaline solution, water supplies hydrogen and the dissociation of water is considered as a key ratedetermining step <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>, the energy barrier for breaking the OH-H bond in water is 0.89 eV on Pt (111) surface and such a high energy barrier clearly hinders the dissociation of water to H ads . Strikingly, the dissociation barrier is reduced to 0.32 eV on NiS (100) surface. Thus, the NiS surface can promote water dissociation substantially and increase the rate of H ads formation by orders of magnitude. Subsequently, the produced H ads would combine to form H 2 and the key quantity of interest is the free energy of hydrogen adsorption G H* on the surface, which is often used as a descriptor for HER <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . We calculated G H* on Pt (111), Pt 3 Ni (111) and NiS (100) surfaces (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>). As the hydrogen binding energy G H* on the NiS surface is much stronger than the optimal value (G H* ¼ 0), the desorption of H ads is suppressed significantly and H 2 production is thus hindered. Consequently, the HER kinetic is sluggish on the NiS surface. In contrast, we find that the hydrogen-binding energies G H* on Pt 3 Ni (111) surface are much smaller and closer to the optimal value; two inequivalent adsorption sites on Pt 3 Ni (111) surface (blue and red) were considered. In fact, one of the two sites (red) has almost identical G H* as that on Pt (111), suggesting that Pt 3 Ni can be almost as efficient as Pt for the production of H 2 . It should be noted that hollowness is probably not the main reason for the HER activity enhancement, as the HER activity of the solid Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs-S is similar to that of the Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs-S with hollow feature (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">23</ref>). Therefore, the synergy between NiS for promoting water dissociation and Pt 3 Ni for enhancing H ads adsorption and combination renders the NiS/Pt 3 Ni heterostructure as an exceptional catalyst for alkaline HER.</p><p>The synergistic effect of the Pt 3 Ni/NiS heterostructure is also responsible for the activity variations among Pt-Ni NW-S/C. For the Pt 3 Ni 1 NWs-S/C, the synergistic effect is too weak due to the limited intimate interface between Pt 3 Ni and NiS, resulting in the stagnant dissociation of the HO-H by NiS, thus reducing the HER activity. With the proper intimate interface, Pt 3 Ni 2 NWs-S can maximize the synergistic effect and achieve the best HER activity. However, the Pt 3 Ni 3 NWs-S and Pt 3 Ni 4 NWs-S with higher density of interface will make the Pt 3 Ni core be wrapped too compact to have enough active sites for Pt to absorb and recombine the H ads into H 2 , leading to the gradually decreased activities. Hence, the suitable densities of NiS in Pt-Ni NWs-S/C are important factors to produce the desirable Pt 3 Ni/NiS interfaces for largely enhancing the alkaline HER activity. All the experimental and theoretical data prove that the unique interface between Pt 3 Ni NWs and NiS nanoparticles is the main factor in promoting the HER activity enhancement in the alkaline condition. However, the more detailed role of sulfide and electrocatalytic mechanism of PtNi/NiS NWs under the basic condition are still not very clear. The partial reason is that the existent corrosion and coordination effect in the basic condition might affect the apparent structure of catalysts, resulting in the electrocatalytic mechanism more complex. The in situ spectroscopic techniques may be good for tracking the catalytic mechanism of Pt 3 Ni/NiS interface nanowires during the HER process in the electrolytes with different pH, which will be our future endeavour.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate a new procedure for making the Pt current density of 37.2 mA cm À 2 at 0.07 V, at pH 14, over 9. (that is, 2.3, 4.6, 6.8 and 9.1), 32 mg CTAC, 60 mg glucose and 5 ml OAm were added into a vial (volume: 30 ml). After the vial had been capped, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 1 h. The resulting homogeneous mixture was then heated from room temperature to 180 °C and maintained at 180 °C for 5 h in an oil bath. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting products were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with ethanol/cyclohexane mixture.</p><p>Preparation of Pt-Ni-S NWs. To the unpurified Pt-Ni NWs mixture at 150 °C, 3 mg sulfur powder dissolved in 1 ml OAm was added under magnetic stirring. The mixture was then kept at 150 °C for another 3 h. The final products were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with an ethanol/cyclohexane mixture.</p><p>Characterization. TEM and HAADF-STEM images were conducted on an FEI Tecnai F20 TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. SEM images were taken with a HITACHI S-4700 cold field-emission SEM operated at 15 kV. The samples were prepared by dropping cyclohexane dispersion of samples onto carbon-coated copper TEM grids using pipettes and dried under ambient condition. PXRD patterns were collected on X'Pert-Pro MPD diffractometer (Netherlands PANalytical) with a Cu Ka X-ray source (l ¼ 1.540598 Å). The concentrations of catalysts were determined by the ICP-AES (710-ES, Varian, ICP-AES). XPS was carried out on an SSI S-Probe XPS Spectrometer. The carbon peak at 284.6 eV was used as a reference to correct for charging effects.</p><p>Electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical measurements were performed by using CHI660 electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). A three-electrode cell was used to perform the electrochemical measurements. The working electrode was a rotating disk electrode (RDE) (diameter: 5 mm, area: 0.196 cm 2 ) from Pine Instruments. A saturated calomel electrode and platinum wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically mixing catalysts with 895 ml of ethanol, 100 ml of water and 5 ml of 5 wt% Nafion solutions for 1 h. The actual mass concentrations of the Pt species in all catalyst inks were controlled at 0.30 mg Pt per ml. Then, 10 and 50 ml of the ink were deposited on RDE dried at room temperature, to obtain the working electrodes for activity and stability test, respectively. The loading of Pt on the working electrodes were 15.3 and 76.5 mg cm À 2 for activity test and stability test, respectively. HER measurements were conducted in pH values of 14, 13, 1 and 0. All the fresh electrolytes with required concentrations were prepared in a volumetric flask by dissolving the required amount of KOH or H 2 SO 4 in Milli-Q water and purged with N 2 before the measurement. During the measurement, RDE electrode was constantly rotating at 1,600 r.p.m. to get rid of the bubbles. Linear sweep voltammetry was carried out between À 0.2 and 0.2 V at the scan rate of 10 mV s À 1 for activity tests. The catalysts were cycled about 20 cycles at the scan rate of 100 mV s À 1 between À 0.2 and 0.2 V until a stable cyclic voltammetry curve was developed before linear sweep voltammetry test. The chronopotentiometry was measured under a constant current density of 5 mA cm À 2 for stability test.</p><p>For comparison, the commercial Pt/C (20% loading, 2-5 nm Pt size, Johnson Matthey) was used as the baseline catalyst with the same loading amount of Pt at 15.3 mg cm À 2 for activity test and 76.5 mg cm À 2 for stability test. The polarization curves with or without insulation resistance compensation are mentioned in the paper. All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature.</p><p>DFT models and calculations. Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the VASP package <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> with the projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . An energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for the plane-wave basis set. The Pt (111), Pt 3 Ni (111) and NiS (100) surfaces were modelled by periodically repeated four-layer slabs with (3 Â 3) unit cells. The Brillouin zone was sampled with the Monkhorst-Pack scheme 40 and 3 Â 3 Â 1 k-point mesh. The atoms in the top three layers were fully relaxed, while the rest of the atoms were fixed in their equilibrium positions. The force convergence criterion for atomic relaxation was 0.02 eV Å À 1 .</p><p>To determine the transition state for water dissociation on the Pt (111) and NiS (100) surfaces, we employed the climbing image nudged elastic band method <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . Furthermore, the force convergence tolerance on each atom in search of the minimum energy path was set to be 0.05 eV Å À 1 . The free energy diagram for HER was obtained by calculating the change of the free energy with a hydrogen atom adsorbed on the surface following the computational hydrogen electrode model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . The hydrogen adsorption free energy G H* is determined as <ref type="figure">E</ref>[surf] are the total energies of the surface with and without the H adsorbate, respectively. E[H 2 ] is the total energy of a hydrogen molecule. DE ZPE is the difference in the zero-point energy between the adsorbed H atom and the gaseous phase H 2 ; DS is the difference in entropy.

After the sulfuration, all the Pt-Ni NWs-S can nicely maintain their original one-dimensional structure without exception, indicating sulfuration does not destroy the structure of Pt-Ni NWs. Interestingly, new NiS nanoparticles are also observed on the surface of Pt-Ni NWs-S, which leads to the unique interfaces. Moreover, it is clear that the density of the newly produced nanoparticles on the surface increases with increasing the ratio of Ni to Pt in the Pt-Ni NWs.</figDesc></figure>

The activities of both Pt 3 Ni 1 NWs-S/C and Pt 3 Ni 4 NWs-S/C at pH of 13 are inferior to their corresponding Pt-Ni NWs/C, similar to the trend at pH 14.
