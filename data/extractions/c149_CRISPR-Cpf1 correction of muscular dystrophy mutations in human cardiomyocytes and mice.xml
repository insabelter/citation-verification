<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene (DMD), is characterized by fatal degeneration of striated muscles. Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the most common lethal features of the disease. We deployed Cpf1, a unique class 2 CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) effector, to correct DMD mutations in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mdx mice, an animal model of DMD. Cpf1-mediated genomic editing of human iPSCs, either by skipping of an out-of-frame DMD exon or by correcting a nonsense mutation, restored dystrophin expression after differentiation to cardiomyocytes and enhanced contractile function. Similarly, pathophysiological hallmarks of muscular dystrophy were corrected in mdx mice following Cpf1-mediated germline editing. These findings are the first to show the efficiency of Cpf1-mediated correction of genetic mutations in human cells and an animal disease model and represent a significant step toward therapeutic translation of gene editing for correction of DMD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene coding for dystrophin, which is a large cytoskeletal protein essential for the integrity of muscle cell membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. DMD causes progressive muscle weakness, culminating in premature death by the age of 30 years, generally from cardiomyopathy. There is no effective treatment for this disease. Numerous approaches to rescue dystrophin expression in DMD have been attempted, including delivery of truncated dystrophin or utrophin by recombinant adenoassociated virus (AAV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref> and skipping of mutant exons with antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules (4). However, these approaches cannot correct DMD mutations or permanently restore dystrophin expression.</p><p>The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system functions as an adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea that defends against phage infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In this system, an endonuclease is guided to specific genomic sequences by a single guide RNA (sgRNA), resulting in DNA cutting near a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. The CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins) system represents a promising approach for correction of diverse genetic defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. However, many challenges remain to be addressed. For example, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), currently the most widely used Cas9 endonuclease, has a G-rich PAM requirement (NGG) that excludes genome editing of AT-rich regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Additionally, the large size of SpCas9 reduces the efficiency of packaging and delivery in low-capacity viral vectors, such as AAV vectors. The Cas9 endonuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), although smaller in size than SpCas9, has a PAM sequence (NNGRRT) that is longer and more complex, thus limiting the range of its genomic targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Smaller CRISPR enzymes with greater flexibility in recognition sequence and comparable cutting efficiency would facilitate precision gene editing, especially for translational applications.</p><p>Recently, a new RNA-guided endonuclease, named Cpf1 (CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1), was shown to be effective in mammalian genome cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Cpf1 has several unique features that expand its genome editing potential: (i) Cpf1-mediated cleavage is guided by a single and short crRNA (abbreviated as gRNA), whereas Cas9-mediated cleavage is guided by a hybrid of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a long trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. (ii) Cpf1 prefers a T-rich PAM at the 5′ end of a protospacer, whereas Cas9 requires a G-rich PAM at the 3′ end of the target sequence. (iii) Cpf1-mediated cleavage produces a sticky end distal to the PAM site, which activates DNA repair machinery, whereas Cas9 cutting generates a blunt end. (iv) Cpf1 also has ribonuclease activity, which can process precursor crRNAs to mature crRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. Like Cas9, Cpf1 binds to a targeted genomic site and generates a double-stranded break, which is then repaired either by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or by homologydirected repair (HDR) if an exogenous template is provided. Although Cpf1 has been shown to be active in mammalian genome editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, its potential usefulness for correction of genetic mutations in mammalian cells and animal models of disease has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>Previously, we and others used CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the DMD mutation in mice and human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Here, we show that Cpf1 provides a robust and efficient RNA-guided genome editing system that can be used to permanently correct DMD mutations by different strategies, thereby restoring dystrophin expression and preventing progression of the disease. These findings provide a new approach for the permanent correction of human genetic mutations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correction of DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by</head><p>Cpf1-mediated genome editing Exon deletions preceding exon 51 of the human DMD gene, which disrupt the open reading frame (ORF) by juxtaposing out-of-frame exons, represent the most common type of human DMD mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Skipping of exon 51 can, in principle, restore the DMD ORF in 13% of DMD patients with exon deletions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. To test the potential of Cpf1 to correct this type of "hotspot" mutation, we used DMD patient fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Riken HPS0164; abbreviated as Riken51), which harbor a deletion of exons 48 to 50, introducing a premature termination codon within exon 51 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>The splice acceptor region is generally pyrimidine-rich <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, which creates an ideal PAM sequence for genome editing by Cpf1 endonuclease (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). To rescue dystrophin expression in Riken51 iPSCs, we used a Cpf1 gRNA to target exon 51, introducing small insertions and deletions (INDELs) in exon 51 by NHEJ and subsequently reframing the dystrophin ORF, theoretically, in one-third of corrected genes, a process we refer to as "reframing" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). We also compared two Cpf1 orthologs, LbCpf1 (from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006) and AsCpf1 (from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6), which use the same PAM sequences for genome cleavage.</p><p>Cpf1 cleavage was targeted near the T-rich splice acceptor site of exon 51 using a gRNA (designated g1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), which was cloned into the pLbCpf1-2A-GFP and pAsCpf1-2A-GFP plasmids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). These plasmids express human codon-optimized LbCpf1 or AsCpf1, plus green fluorescent protein (GFP), enabling fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of Cpf1-expressing cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Initially, we evaluated the cleavage efficiency of Cpf1 editing with g1 in human 293T cells. Both LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 efficiently induced DNA cleavage with g1, as detected using the T7E1 assay that recognizes and cleaves nonperfectly matched DNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</p><p>Next, we used LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 with g1 to edit Riken51 iPSCs, and using the T7E1 assay, we observed genome cleavage at DMD exon 51 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). Genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from the Cpf1-edited DMD exon 51 were cloned and sequenced (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). We observed INDELs near the exon 51 splice acceptor site in both LbCpf1-and AsCpf1-edited Riken51 iPSCs (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). Single clones from a mixture of reframed Riken51 iPSCs were picked and expanded, and the edited genomic region was sequenced. Of the 12 clones, we observed 4 clones with reframed DMD exon 51, which restored the ORF (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</p><p>Restoration of dystrophin expression in DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes after Cpf1-mediated reframing Riken51 iPSCs edited by CRISPR-Cpf1 using the reframing strategy were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Cardiomyocytes with the reframed DMD gene were identified by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using a forward primer targeting exon 47 and a reverse primer targeting exon 52, and the PCR products were sequenced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Uncorrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes have a premature termination codon following the first eight amino acids encoded by exon 51 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Cardiomyocytes differentiated from Cpf1-edited Riken51 iPSCs showed restoration of the DMD ORF, as seen by sequencing of the RT-PCR products from amplification of exons 47 to 52 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). We also confirmed restoration of dystrophin protein expression by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry using a dystrophin antibody (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Even without clonal selection and expansion, cardiomyocytes differentiated from Cpf1-edited iPSC mixtures showed levels of dystrophin protein comparable to wild-type (WT) cardiomyocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</p><p>From mixtures of LbCpf1-edited Riken51 iPSCs, we picked two clones (clones #2 and #5) with in-frame INDELs of different sizes and differentiated the clones into cardiomyocytes. Clone #2 had an 8-bp deletion at the 5′ end of exon 51, together with an endogenous deletion of exons 48 to 50. The total 405-bp deletion restored the DMD  ORF and allowed for the production of a truncated dystrophin protein with a 135-amino acid deletion. Clone #5 had a 17-bp deletion in exon 51 and produced dystrophin protein with a 138-amino acid deletion. Although there is high efficiency of cleavage by Cpf1, the amount of DNA inserted or deleted at the cleavage site varies. Additionally, INDELs can generate extra codons at the edited locus, causing changes of the ORF. The dystrophin protein expressed by clone #2 cardiomyocytes generated an additional four amino acids (Leu-Leu-Leu-Arg) between exon 47 and exon 51, whereas dystrophin protein expressed by clone #5 cardiomyocytes generated only one additional amino acid (Leu). From both clones #2 and #5, we observed restored dystrophin protein by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, F</ref> and<ref type="figure">G</ref>). Because of the large size of dystrophin, the internally deleted forms migrated similarly to WT dystrophin on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.</p><p>We also performed functional analysis of DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and cellular respiration rates. Uncorrected DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes had significantly fewer mitochondria than the LbCpf1corrected cardiomyocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). After LbCpf1-mediated reframing, both corrected clones restored mitochondrial number to a level comparable to that of WT cardiomyocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). Clone #2 iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes also showed an increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) compared to uncorrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes at baseline (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>). OCR was inhibited by oligomycin in all iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and treatment with the uncoupling agent FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) enhanced OCR. Finally, treatment with rotenone and antimycin A further inhibited OCR in all cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that Cpf1mediated DMD correction improved respiratory capacity of mitochondria in corrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Our findings show that Cpf1-mediated reframing is a highly efficient strategy to rescue DMD phenotypes in human cardiomyocytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restoration of dystrophin expression in DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by Cpf1-mediated exon skipping</head><p>In contrast to the single gRNA-mediated reframing method, which introduces small INDELs, exon skipping uses two gRNAs to disrupt splice sites and generates a large deletion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). As an independent strategy to restore dystrophin expression in the Riken51 iPSCs, we designed two LbCpf1 gRNAs (g2 and g3) that target the 3′ end of intron 50 and tested the cleavage efficiency in human 293T cells. The T7E1 assay showed that g2 had higher cleavage efficiency within intron 50 compared to g3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). Therefore, we co-delivered LbCpf1, g2, and g1 (g1 targets the 5′ region of exon 51) into Riken51 iPSCs, with the aim of disrupting the splice acceptor site of exon 51. Genomic PCR showed a lower band in LbCpf1-edited iPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), and sequencing data confirmed the presence of a deletion of ~200 bp between intron 50 and exon 51, which disrupted the conserved splice acceptor site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</p><p>Targeting specificity of Cpf1 was evaluated using the top 10 potential genome-wide off-target sites (OT-01 to OT-10) for each gRNA, as predicted by Cas-OFFinder (www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/) (tables S1 and S2). Efficient cleavage bands were observed at the on-target site, and most of the off-target sites did not show a detectable cleavage band by the T7E1 assay (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) or by quantitative capillary electrophoresis using a fragment analyzer (figs. S3 and S4).</p><p>Riken51 iPSCs edited by the exon skipping strategy with g1 and g2 were differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Cells harboring the edited DMD allele were identified by RT-PCR using a forward primer targeting exon 47 and a reverse primer targeting exon 52, showing deletion of the exon 51 splice acceptor site, which allows skipping of exon 51 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>). Sequencing of the RT-PCR products confirmed that exon 47 was spliced to exon 52, which restored the DMD ORF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>). Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry confirmed the restoration of dystrophin protein expression in a mixture of LbCpf1-edited cardiomyocytes with g1 and g2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). Thus, Cpf1 editing by the exon skipping strategy is highly efficient in rescuing the DMD phenotype in human cardiomyocytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restoration of dystrophin in mdx mice by Cpf1-mediated correction</head><p>To further evaluate the potential of Cpf1-mediated Dmd correction in vivo, we used LbCpf1 to permanently correct the mutation in the germ line of mdx mice by HDR-mediated correction or NHEJ-mediated reframing. mdx mice carry a nonsense mutation in exon 23 of the Dmd gene because of a C-to-T transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Three gRNAs (g1, g2, and g3) that target exon 23 were screened and tested in mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts for cleavage efficiency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). The T7E1 assay revealed that LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 had different cleavage efficiencies at Dmd exon 23 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). On the basis of sequencing results, LbCpf1-mediated genome editing using g2 generated a greater occurrence of INDELs in mouse fibroblasts compared to g3 (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>).</p><p>LbCpf1 editing with g2 recognizes a PAM sequence 9 bp upstream of the mutation site and creates a staggered double-stranded DNA cut 8 bp downstream of the mutation site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). To obtain HDR genome editing, we used a 180-bp single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) in combination with LbCpf1 and g2, because it has been shown that ssODNs are more efficient in introducing small genomic modifications than double-stranded donor plasmids (6, 7). We generated an ssODN containing 90 bp of sequence homology flanking the cleavage site, including four silent mutations and a Tse I restriction site to facilitate genotyping, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. This ssODN was designed to be used with LbCpf1 and g2 to correct the C-to-T mutation within Dmd exon 23 and to restore dystrophin in mdx mice by HDR.</p><p>Correction of muscular dystrophy in mdx mice by LbCpf1-mediated HDR or NHEJ mdx zygotes were coinjected with in vitro transcribed LbCpf1 mRNA, in vitro transcribed g2 gRNA, and 180-bp ssODN and reimplanted into pseudopregnant females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Three litters of LbCpf1-edited mdx mice were analyzed by the T7E1 assay and Tse I RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Of the 24 pups born, 12 were T7E1-positive and 5 carried corrected alleles (mdx-C1 to mdx-C5), as detected by Tse I RFLP and sequencing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius/plantaris) from WT, mdx, and LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice were analyzed at 4 weeks of age. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of muscle showed fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration in mdx muscle, whereas LbCpf1corrected (mdx-C) muscle displayed normal muscle morphology and no signs of a dystrophic phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Immunohistochemistry showed the absence of dystrophin-positive fibers in muscle sections of mdx mice, whereas mdx-C muscle corrected by LbCpf1-mediated HDR showed dystrophin protein expression in a majority of muscle fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>Additionally, we performed histological analysis of different tissues from multiple mdx-C mice with correction rates from 8 to 50%. All LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice showed restored dystrophin expression in multiple tissues, including skeletal muscles, heart, and brain (figs. S6 and S7). Muscle of mdx-C mice with 50% genomic correction showed full restoration of dystrophin protein and displayed no sign of fibrosis or inflammatory infiltration, which is consistent with our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Western blot analysis showed expression of dystrophin protein in multiple skeletal muscle groups, heart, and brain (fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>), consistent with percentages of dystrophin-positive fibers seen with immunohistochemistry (fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</p><p>LbCpf1-mediated correction of the Dmd mutation in germ cells was evaluated in eggs and sperm of LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice by T7E1 assays and Tse I RFLP. All LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice carried a corrected allele in their germ cells (fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). Genome editing efficiency  of Cas9 and LbCpf1 was compared at the Dmd exon 23 locus, and no significant difference was observed (table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</p><p>Physiological and functional analyses were also performed in WT, mdx, and LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were decreased substantially in mdx-C mice and were inversely correlated with the percentage of genome correction (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The forelimb grip strength test indicated that LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice had improved muscle strength compared to mdx mice (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Here, we show that the newly discovered CRISPR-Cpf1 nuclease can efficiently correct DMD mutations in patient-derived iPSCs and mdx mice, allowing for restoration of dystrophin expression. Lack of dystrophin in DMD has been shown to disrupt the integrity of the sarcolemma, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. We found increased mtDNA and higher OCRs in LbCpf1-corrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes compared to uncorrected DMD iPSCderived cardiomyocytes. Metabolic abnormalities of human DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were also rescued by Cpf1-mediated genomic editing. Our findings also demonstrated the robustness and efficiency of Cpf1 in mouse genome editing. By using HDR-mediated correction, the ORF of the mouse Dmd gene was completely restored, and pathophysiological hallmarks of the dystrophic phenotype, such as fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration, were also rescued.</p><p>Two different strategies-reframing and exon skipping-were applied to restore the ORF of the DMD gene using LbCpf1-mediated genome editing. Reframing creates small INDELs and restores the ORF by placing out-of-frame codons in frame. Only one gRNA is required for reframing. Although we did not observe any differences in subcellular localization between WT dystrophin protein and reframed dystrophin protein by immunocytochemistry, we observed differences in dystrophin expression level, mtDNA quantity, and OCR in different edited clones, suggesting that reframed dystrophin may not be structurally or functionally identical to WT dystrophin.</p><p>Various issues should be considered with respect to the use of one or two gRNAs with Cpf1 editing. Here, we show that two gRNAs are more effective than one gRNA for disruption of the splice acceptor site compared to reframing. When using two gRNAs, Cpf1 editing excises the intervening region and not only removes the splice acceptor site but also can be designed to remove deleterious "AG" nucleotides, eliminating the possibility of generating a pseudosplice acceptor site. However, with two gRNAs, there is the necessity that both gRNAs cleave simultaneously, which may not occur. If only one of the two gRNAs cleaves, the desired deletion will not be generated. However, there remains the possibility that cleavage with one of the two gRNAs will generate INDELS at the targeted exon region, reframing the ORF, because in theory, one-third of the INDELS will be in frame. Using one gRNA to disrupt the splice acceptor site seems more efficient because it eliminates the need for two simultaneous cuts to occur. However, there is uncertainty with respect to the length of the INDEL generated by one gRNA-mediated editing. With one gRNA, there remains the possibility of leaving exonic AG nucleotides near the cleavage site, which can serve as an alternative pseudosplice acceptor site.</p><p>With its unique T-rich PAM sequence, Cpf1 further expands the genome editing range of the CRISPR family, which is important for potential correction of other disease-related mutations because not all mutation sites contain G-rich PAM sequences for SpCas9 or PAMs for other Cas9 orthologs. Moreover, the staggered cut generated by Cpf1 may also be advantageous for NHEJ-mediated genome editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Finally, the LbCpf1 used in this study is 140 amino acids smaller than the most widely used SpCas9, which would enhance packaging and delivery by AAV.</p><p>Our off-target analysis by T7E1 assays and quantitative capillary electrophoresis using a fragment analyzer showed similar results to previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>, indicating that LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 had high genome-wide targeting efficiency and high specificity comparable to those of SpCas9. This is reflective of LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 not tolerating mismatches at the 5′ PAM proximal region, thereby lessening the frequency of off-targeting effect.</p><p>Our findings show that Cpf1 is highly efficient in correcting human DMD and mouse Dmd mutations in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR-Cpf1mediated genome editing represents a new and powerful approach to permanently eliminate genetic mutations and rescue abnormalities associated with DMD and other disorders.</p></div>
