<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>MRI-guided pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) combined with systemic infusion of ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles (MB) causes localized blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption that is currently being advocated for increasing drug or gene delivery in neurological diseases. The mechanical acoustic cavitation effects of opening the BBB by low-intensity pFUS+MB, as evidenced by contrast-enhanced MRI, resulted in an immediate damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) response including elevations in heat-shock protein 70, IL-1, IL-18, and TNFα indicative of a sterile inflammatory response (SIR) in the parenchyma. Concurrent with DAMP presentation, significant elevations in proinflammatory, antiinflammatory, and trophic factors along with neurotrophic and neurogenesis factors were detected; these elevations lasted 24 h. Transcriptomic analysis of sonicated brain supported the proteomic findings and indicated that the SIR was facilitated through the induction of the NFκB pathway. Histological evaluation demonstrated increased albumin in the parenchyma that cleared by 24 h along with TUNEL + neurons, activated astrocytes, microglia, and increased cell adhesion molecules in the vasculature. Infusion of fluorescent beads 3 d before pFUS+MB revealed the infiltration of CD68 + macrophages at 6 d postsonication, as is consistent with an innate immune response. pFUS+MB is being considered as part of a noninvasive adjuvant treatment for malignancy or neurodegenerative diseases. These results demonstrate that pFUS+MB induces an SIR compatible with ischemia or mild traumatic brain injury. Further investigation will be required before this approach can be widely implemented in clinical trials.</p><p>pulsed focused ultrasound | microbubbles | blood-brain barrier | sterile inflammation | magnetic resonance imaging T he temporal proteomic profile in response to blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) consists of molecular features that are common across noninfectious insults such as ischemia, trauma, or autoimmune diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The main purpose of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) is to maintain homeostasis, preventing the passive crossing of cells and molecules that could induce inflammation or damage to cells.

The opening of the BBB by pFUS+MB resulted in immediate damage-associated molecular patterns that led to a sterile inflammation response within the parenchyma that lasted 24 h. Currently, pFUS+MB exposure is under consideration as an adjuvant in the treatment in malignancy or neurodegenerative disease. These results demonstrate that pFUS+MB induces a sterile inflammatory response compatible with ischemia or mild traumatic brain injury. Further investigation will be required before translation to clinical trials. and acoustic cavitation forces inducing stable MB oscillations that can be accompanied by shear stress and microstreaming (i.e., radiating forces originating from MB) or inertial cavitation with unstable oscillations and violent rapid collapse of MB at the endothelial surface resulting in decreased tight junction integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. pFUS+MB has been reported to cause hemodynamic alterations in the brain associated with temporary vasoconstriction, as seen with BBBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.

These results indicate that BBBD by pFUS+MB induces a transient SIR as observed with trauma or damage to NVU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The major findings of this study were as follows: (i) pFUS+MB infusion resulted in acute BBBD observed by MRI and on histology; (ii) pFUS+MB rapidly (within 5 min) induced protein expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) along with the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL1α, IL1β, IL18, and IFNγ, lasting 12-24 h; (iii) molecular analyses of pFUS+MB-treated brains revealed increased CCTFs and transcriptomic changes associated with the NFκB pathway and sterile inflammation; (iv) histologic analyses of pFUS+MB-treated brain showed increased numbers of TUNEL + cells, up-regulation of ICAM, and activated astrocytes and microglia up to/for 24 h postsonication injury; and (v) tropism of systemic CD68 + macrophages to targeted brain was found several days postsonication. For this study, the pFUS+MB parameters were chosen to cause BBBD and cerebral vasculature vasospasm without causing parenchymal damage or microhemorrhages <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>. We demonstrate that pFUS+MB initiated a cascade of molecular profile and cellular changes consistent with the induction of a sterile inflammation in the targeted brain.</p><p>Assessment of BBBD. All animals underwent MRI before sonication to ensure that rats had normal brain ventricular anatomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Following pFUS+MB, gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-weighted (T1w) images demonstrated contrast enhancement in the frontal lobe demarcating the area that was harvested for molecular and histological analysis at different time points (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining, coinciding with areas of BBBD on MRI, revealed the increased presence of albumin at 6 h postsonication that returned to the levels in the contralateral cortex by 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). H&amp;E staining demonstrated no evidence of microhemorrhages within the pFUS+MB-treated cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</p><p>Molecular Response to pFUS+MB. Homogenates from sonicated brains were obtained at various time points, and proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed. We observed no difference in mRNA levels in the sham-treated controls and contralateral brain samples from pFUS+MB-treated rats (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Molecular patterns consistent with injury or damage in the targeted brain were observed with significant elevations (measured in picograms per milliliter) in proteins, including HSP70 (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) and IL1α, and a fivefold increase in mRNA of Il1a within 5-30 min following pFUS+MB exposure (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and see Tables <ref type="table">S2</ref> and<ref type="table">S3</ref> for a complete list of fold-changes and description for mRNA evaluated). Moreover, significant increases in the expression of IL18 protein (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) and mRNA for Il1b (&gt;21-fold) were detected between 5 and 30 min post pFUS+MB. Within 5 min after sonication, significant increases in the expression of TNFα protein along with the production of other proinflammatory factors (IFNγ, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-17) and chemotactic factors [RANTES, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP3α)] were detected. Within 30 min following sonication, a greater than fivefold increase was observed in mRNA for Il1a, Il1b, and Tnf along with immune cell trophic factors (Ccl12, Cxcl1, and Cxcl3), selectins (Selp) and CAM (Icam1), the Ig superfamily of receptors (Cd83), the high-affinity receptor (Csf2rb) for binding IL3, IL5, and colony-stimulating factor (CSF), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase, Ptgs2) Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. BBBD by pFUS+MB. (A) Diagram of the experimental design for pFUS-treated rat brain for histological analysis. T2w MRI was used to target FUS with points (red circles) ∼2 mm in diameter placed in the left frontal cortex anterior to the lateral ventricle. Following pFUS+MB, Gd-enhanced T1w images were obtained. The dashed white line outlines the contrast enhancement. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>); these increases are consistent with activation of the NFκb pathway and sterile inflammation. Concurrent with the early expression of inflammatory CCTFs, significant increases (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) in the expression of the proteins VEGF, erythropoietin (EPO), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), IL4, IL10, and IL13 were also detected in the sonicated parenchyma (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> B and C). The increased expression in VEGF would be observed with changes in vascular permeability to albumin and plasma proteins resulting from BBBD. Between 0.5 and 12 h, persistent and significant expression of cell stress-reactive proteins, pro-and antiinflammatory CCTFs, was detected in the pFUS-treated brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The increase in ICAM1 started at 2 h postsonication and persisted to 24 h (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA). Other factors, such as stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF1α) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), were significantly elevated at a single time point from 2 to 6 h postsonication. Two hours postsonication, the protein expression of proinflammatory factors (IL2, IL6, Il12p70, IL17, and IL18) and antiinflammatory factors (IL4, and IL13, FGF) was not significantly elevated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The increased mRNA expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (Ccl12) (&gt;4-to 114-fold) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) (greater than three-to fivefold) was mirrored by increased expression of CCTF proteins between 0.5 and 24 h postsonication. The elevation of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) protein (i.e., starting at 2 h postsonication) also could have contributed to the BBB opening as well as inducing the tropism of systemic macrophages or microglia to the sonicated parenchyma <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein was significantly (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) increased starting at 12 through 24 h postsonication (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>). Between 6 and 12 h postsonication, mRNA for Stat3 was elevated by more than twofold, presumably in response to various cytokines and growth factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</p><p>Real-time RT-PCR showed that activation of the NFκB pathway peaked at 6 h after pFUS+MB with 32 of the 39 identified mRNAs elevated significantly (by more than twofold) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). The elevations in mRNA included genes encoding Nfkb2, chemotaxis and inflammatory factors (Ccl11, Cd40, Csf3, Cxcl1, Il6, and Irf1), and genes involved in cell survival (Bcla2a1 and Birc3). In addition to the increased mRNA expression of Mmp9, urokinase-plasminogen activator (Plau) encoding for the degradation of extracellular matrix also was elevated between 6 and 12 h, suggesting a possible effect of sonication on the extracellular proteins. At 12 h postsonication, 24 of 32 mRNAs at 6 h remained elevated by more than twofold compared with the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Within 6 h postsonication, Western blot analysis revealed significant increases in the expression of the proteins phospho (p)-protein kinase B (Akt) along with phospho (p)-glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (pGSK3β); these increases are consistent with prosurvival processes (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Other possible signaling pathways, including p38-MAPK, pERK, and pJNK, were not significantly elevated following pFUS+MB to the brain (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</p><p>No significant elevations of other DAMPs associated with SIR, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), high mobility group box 1 protein, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), or ATP, were observed in sonicated brains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>). The inability to detect these DAMPs or to identify alternate inflammatory pathways may result from the time points when samples were collected or possible dilution effects. Taken together, these results indicate that mechanical effects from pFUS+MBinduced sterile inflammation in the brain primarily through NFκBassociated pathways. We did not detect an elevation in caspase 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>), suggesting that the TUNEL + cells were damaged neuronal elements.</p><p>Histological Alterations Following pFUS+MB. IF histological evaluations of the rat brain following pFUS+MB exposure were performed at 1, 6, and 24 h on three to six adjacent 5-10-μmthick sections (Figs. 5-7 and Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref> and<ref type="figure">S4</ref>). To investigate if pFUS+MB-induced cellular damage, TUNEL enzymatic staining was performed. With quantitative image analyses, an approximately five-to sevenfold increase (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) in the number of TUNEL + cells was observed in the pFUS+MBtargeted cortex compared with contralateral brain between 1 and 6 h postexposure (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). There also was a trending increase in TUNEL + cells at 24 h postsonication compared with contralateral cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). Further analysis of TUNEL + cells at 1 h postsonication revealed that the majority of damaged cells were neurons (NeuN), and a minority were astrocytes (GFAP) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). In response to pFUS+MB, progressively greater expression of ICAM (fourfold compared with contralateral hemisphere; P &lt; 0.05) was detected on the endothelium starting at 6 h and peaking at 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> A and D). The delayed increase in ICAM upon IF staining complements the elevations (more than two-to sixfold) in protein and mRNA expression observed starting as early as 30 min postsonication.

Brain homogenates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer from brain tissues harvested at 5 min and 0.5, 6, and 12 h after pFUS+MB. Equal amounts of sample proteins (i.e., 25 μg) were loaded, and Western blotting was performed. The activation of protein was quantified as a ratio of phosphorylated to total proteins. The ratio was compared with the sham activation ratio to calculate fold changes in activation. Each time point had n = 3 animals, and the data in the graph represent the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments (one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons; *P &lt; 0.05). The figure was created by splicing the phosphoprotein bands and merging them together with total protein bands for clear and easy representation of changes in phosphoproteins.

T2*w images obtained 6 d after pFUS+MB revealed more hypointense voxels that are consistent with the migration of FlSPION-labeled cells into the sonicated parenchyma (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>). IF revealed that the number of CD68 + cells containing intracellular fluorescent beads was about fourfold greater (P &lt; 0.05) within the pFUS+MB-treated parenchyma than in the contralateral hemisphere. The increase in chemoattractants following pFUS+MB probably was responsible for the tropism of FLSPION CD68 + macrophages into the parenchyma.</p></div>

However, this proposed mechanism does not address how the cavitation forces interact directly with other cells in the NVU. In the current study, the pFUS parameters used were selected to minimize parenchymal damage while still transiently opening the BBB without associated microhemorrhages that have been reported to be an indication of tissue damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>. Following sonication, brains were harvested at various time points to determine the changes in proteomic and mRNA expression and to elucidate the possible pathways associated with the observed Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Evaluation of TUNEL staining following pFUS to the brain. (A, Left) TUNEL staining revealed a significant sevenfold increase in the number of cells at 1 h and a fivefold increase at 6 h after pFUS+MB that decreased toward the levels in the contralateral cortex by 24 h post pFUS+MB. (Right) Quantitative analysis. Quantitation of TUNEL staining was calculated from mean cell counts from 10 FOV per hemisphere in three consecutive sections from each of three rats. Statistical analyses were based on oneway ANOVA with multiple comparisons with the contralateral hemisphere; *P &lt; 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SD. (Scale bars, 100 μm.)

Fibrous astrocytes are indicated by white arrowheads. (Scale bars, 100 μm.) (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref> for a representative TUNEL-stained whole-brain section.) BBBD. We propose that because the MBs were confined within vessels in an intact BBB, the effect of pFUS on MB causes cavitation forces that would result in shockwaves (i.e., acoustic pressure waves into the parenchyma) (30) that activate microglia, astrocytes, and neurons beyond the vasculature. BBBD and changes in TJP expression represent one aspect of the effect of pFUS+MB that is associated with triggering the SIR, starting with increases in TNFα and other cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. Moreover, the increase in VEGF and MCP-1 and Ccl2 gene expression would contribute to BBBD and decrease TJP expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. Given the molecular responses that pFUS+MB induced in the brain, cavitation-induced shockwaves may cause cell membrane stretching or damage (51) that ultimately can induce CCTF and CAM expression. The release of CCTFs following pFUS+MB could alter cationic fluxes through stretch-activated channels within the endothelium and neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. Stretch-sensitive channels in neurons respond to the shockwaves from pFUS+MB and modulate the influx of cations (e.g., Ca +2 ) into cells. Lowintensity FUS effects on MB in solution located outside nematodes expressing stretch-sensitive cationic channels resulted in altered behavior and activated neurons following Ca +2 influx into cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>. Low-intensity FUS alone did not induce neuronal activation or alter behavior in the nematodes. These results support our hypothesis that the shockwaves from acoustic cavitation of MB was the primary force behind the increased proteomic and mRNA changes in the sonicated brain. Further studies are needed to determine if radiation forces from pFUS alone at higher peak negative pressures would recapitulate the molecular changes observed when MB were used.</p><p>The mechanotransductive (i.e., mechanical stimuli converted into biological activity) effects of pFUS+MB in the brain initiating an SIR accompanied by the release of DAMPs (i.e., HSP70, IL1α) and BBBD are consistent with the activation of NFκB-associated pathways and injury to the NVU (5, 14, 17, 48, 56, 57). Based on  <ref type="figure">S5</ref> for representative fluorescent GFAP sections of fibrous astrocytes.) GFAP was significantly elevated in the ipsilateral hemisphere at 6 and 24 h compared with the contralateral hemisphere. (D) Quantitative analysis for ICAM, GFAP, and Iba1 from sonicated brain at 1, 6, and 24 h. ICAM and Iba1 values were calculated from mean cell counts from 10 FOV per hemisphere in three consecutive sections from each of three rats. For GFAP staining, the area of positive fluorescence signal was calculated using Image J from 10 FOV per hemisphere in three consecutive sections from each of three rats. Statistical analyses were based on one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons with the contralateral hemisphere (*P &lt; 0.05) for ICAM and Iba1 and on a paired t test for GFAP (P &lt; 0.05). In the GFAP graph the control bars represent the contralateral cortex. Data are presented as mean ± SD. (Scale bars, 100 μm for Iba1 and GFAP; 10 μm for ICAM.)

The presence of TNFα and IL1β also would provide a feedback loop to stimulate NFκB pathways and the SIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>. The increase in IL1β and the presence of albumin in the interstitial spaces has been shown to promote microglial activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref> and induce the transcription of Ptgs2 (cyclooxygenase 2) detected early after sonications. The prolonged expression of TNFα and IL1β following pFUS+MB has similarities to the temporal proteomic profile obtained by microdialysis from the parenchyma of patients with traumatic brain injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>.</p><p>The early (i.e., within 2 h post pFUS+MB) increase observed in proinflammatory cytokines presumably originating from activated microglia or macrophages also could be responsible for the delayed protein expression of antiinflammatory cytokines (IL4, IL10, and IL13) and/or neurotrophic factors (BDNF, SDF1α, VEGF, and EPO) as previously reported with BBBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>.

It is possible that the significantly delayed expression of BDNF protein along with induced antiapoptotic Bcl2a1 and Birc3 mRNA would have limited the extent of apoptosis and reactive microglia by 24 h postsonication <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75)</ref>. It has been reported that low-intensity pFUS without MB used in neuromodulation studies increased BDNF expression by CA1 and CA3 neurons in the hippocampus within 45 min, stimulating neurogenesis and brain plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>.</p><p>Pulsed FUS+MB has been reported to increase the expression of pAkt along with the downstream signaling molecule pGSK3β at 1.5 h and 24 h, but there are conflicting reports as to whether there are changes in MAPK following sonication of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77)</ref>. In the current study, transient significant elevations (P &lt; 0.05) in pAkt (at 6 h) and pGSK3β (at 5 and 30 min) were detected following pFUS+MB; these elevations declined to baseline levels by 12 h. However, there was no increase in p38-MAPK. The activation of Akt could be the result of oxidative stress observed with cerebral ischemia/hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref> and/or the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (65) detected following sonication-induced sterile inflammation.

In the current study, we used pFUS at a peak negative pressure of 0.3 MPa with MB infusions to cause BBBD, and no microhemorrhages were detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81)</ref>; however, we observed a significant increase in the number of TUNEL + cells at 1 and 6 h postsonication. The increase in TUNEL + cells may be the result of inherent differences in skull thickness and energy absorption or interspecies differences in cerebral physiology.</p><p>In vivo prelabeling with FlSPION has been used to track the migration of systemic macrophages by MRI, providing temporal spatial localization of tagged cells to injured areas following traumatic brain injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. We previously reported that in vivo labeling with FlSPION provides the ability after pFUS to track via MRI and histology the homing of these systemic macrophages to pFUS-targeted sites within muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(83)</ref>. In our previous study, FlSPION beads were infused 3 d before sonication to provide sufficient time for CD68 + macrophages to endocytose the particles so labeled cells could be tracked by MRI and histology. Moreover, pFUS targeted to tissues also resulted in a shift toward antiinflammatory (M2) rather than proinflammatory (M1) macrophage phenotypes in the absence of histological damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85)</ref>. In the current study, 6 d after pFUS+MB, hypointense voxels detected by T2*w MRI and FlSPION-labeled CD68 + macrophages observed via IF staining were scattered throughout the targeted brain. The presence of labeled macrophages is consistent with the local increases in chemotactic factors inducing tropism of immune cells from the circulation to the targeted parenchyma. Further investigation is required to determine the relationship between pFUS+MB treatment and the initial homing of innate immune cells and macrophage phenotypes in the targeted parenchyma.</p><p>It has been reported that exposure of the hippocampus to pFUS+MB in AD models revealed microglial phagocytosing beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and increased neurogenesis based on bromo-deoxyuridine uptake or double-cortin staining of proliferating cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86)</ref>. Neurobehavioral testing of these treated mice demonstrated improvements in memory function following multiple pFUS+MB exposures. These reports speculated that sonication stimulated neurogenesis, presumably through the release of growth factors, and recommend further studies. Although the molecular mechanisms were not addressed in these AD studies, we have clearly demonstrated that pFUS+MB induces increased expression of CCTFs that could contribute to microglial activation, which in turn could contribute to the clearance of βAPP plaques. Within 2 h after pFUS+MB we detected a significant doubling of IL1β that would activate microglia and clear βAPP plaques from the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref>. Moreover, the presence of inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the expression of BDNF, EPO, and VEGF in our study and could explain the enhanced neurogenesis observed in AD models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>. Opening of the BBB was associated with the influx of serum products that represent damage signals to microglia, resulting in activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>. Persistent overexpression of IL1β has been shown to reduce amyloid plaques but to increase phosphorylated tau pathology in an AD mouse model <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref>. Increased tau has been associated with an increase in GSK3β activity that was observed following pFUS+MB in this study and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>. Further studies are necessary to investigate the long-term consequences of repeated SIR events following multiple weekly exposures of the brain to pFUS+MB and a role for pFUS+MB as a possible treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>This study has a few limitations that need to be addressed. The changes in proteomic and transcriptome expression observed following pFUS+MB to the brain were determined only in female rats. It is unknown if the molecular changes we observed are applicable across strains, species, ages, or genders. Because pFUS+MB exerts a mechanical effect and has been shown to cause BBBD in various experimental models, it is likely that the increased expression of CCTFs resulting in a transient SIR would still occur. We also observed a heterogeneous response to pFUS+MB, including variations in contrast enhancement on MRI that was dependent on the distance from the top of the skull and potential energy dissipation of the FUS exposure. The variability in the extent and type of insult to the parenchyma may result from skull thickness or from the sensitivity of the BBB and neuronal elements to the acoustic cavitation forces generated by the pFUS interaction with MB. We also were unable to identify clearly which neuronal cellular elements primarily contributed to the SIR following pFUS+MB. Furthermore, examination of pFUS+MB should be performed in larger animal models mimicking sonication exposures to tumors to determine if SIR is induced within the parenchyma. Further research is needed to determine how the molecular and pathological response to multiple pFUS+MB will impact the reparative or neurodegenerative processes in the targeted brain.</p><p>In summary, image-guided pFUS+MB is a clinically relevant, noninvasive technique that can effectively cause transient opening of the BBB and has been used to enhance the retention and permeability of drugs or gene therapy materials within targeted regions in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. Previous studies have indicated that the mechanical effects of pFUS+MB were confined primarily to the endothelium and vessel wall and were associated with cerebral vasculature vasospasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Within 5 min of pFUS+MB, we observed the transient BBBD and an increased expression of DAMPs leading to an SIR through NFκB pathways that lasted for ∼24 h. Moreover, there was evidence of early neuronal and astrocytic injury, based on TUNEL staining, and astrocyte and microglial activation along with increased expression of CAM. The SIR within the parenchyma influenced the tropism of systemic macrophages to the targeted brain. These results indicate that the mechanotransductive effects of pFUS+MB in the brain require further investigation to determine pFUS+MB's potential clinical contribution to the treatment of neurological diseases.</p></div>

Female 8-to 10-wk-old Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Charles River Laboratory were used in this study.</p><p>MRI-Guided pFUS+MB. Rats were anesthetized with isofluorane [1-3.5% (vol/vol)] and 100% O 2 through a nosecone for all experiments. MRI was performed using a 3-T MR scanner (Achieva Philips Healthcare) using either a surface coil (RK-100; FUS Instruments) or a 3-cm diameter solenoid coil (Philips Research Laboratories). Targeting coordinates were registered (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) on axial T2w images of the rat brain acquired before sonication with the following parameters: turbo spin echo (TSE) with repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 2,000/70 ms. pFUS was performed with the following parameters: 0.3 MPa acoustic pressure was applied in 10-ms bursts and a 1% duty cycle (120 s per nine focal points) using a single-element spherical FUS transducer (center frequency: 589.636 KHz; focal number: 0.8; active diameter: 7.5 cm) (FUS Instruments). The focal point of the FUS transducer was targeted based on an axial T2w MRI from the anterior cortex to the lateral ventricle with nonoverlapping 2-mm circles (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Sonications were accompanied by MB infusion of 100 μL Optison (GE Healthcare) through the tail vein at a rate of 1 μL/s. After sonication, rats received 200 μL gadofosveset (Ablavar, an albuminbinding chelated Gd formulation; Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc.) via the tail vein, and axial T1w contrast-enhanced images were obtained with the following parameters: TSE (TR/TE 350/12 ms). High-resolution images following sonication to detect the presence of FlSPION-labeled macrophages were obtained with the following sequences: T2w TSE (TR/TE 2,769/60 ms), T2*w (TR/TE 1,301/7.0 ms), number of echoes 5, ΔTE 7.0 ms, flip angle 30°, T1wGd TSE (TR/TE 600/20 ms).</p><p>Molecular Analysis. At 0 (sham, n = 5), 0.08, 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after sonication, rats (n = 5 per time point) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane before decapitation. The brains were dissected from the skull, and the sonicated tissue and the corresponding sham tissue were isolated. Tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C until homogenization in cell lysis buffer (9803S; Cell Signaling Technology) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (S8820-2TAB; Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were centrifuged at 15,996 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for analyses. Total protein was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (23227; Thermo Scientific). Homogenates (2 mg/mL total protein) were analyzed by Rat Bio-Plex Cytokine 24-Plex group I assay (171-K1001M; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) or ELISAs for the following: stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) (RS0074; NeoBiolab), BDNF (ELR-BDNF; RayBiotech, Inc.), MMP9; FGF (MFB00), ICAM (RIC100), HSP70 (DYC1663-2), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (MHG00), all from R&amp;D Systems, Inc. All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Samples were run with a protein concentration of 2 mg/mL and were read on a spectrophotometric plate reader (Spectra Max M5; Molecular Devices).</p><p>RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR. For the assessment sham and NFκΒ-treated brains were obtained at 0.5, 6, and 12 h after sonication (n = 3 per time point) and were extracted into RNAlater (Ambion/Life Technologies) and stored at -20 °C. Between 60 and 70 mg of tissue were homogenized in a Paris Cell Disruption Buffer with Omni Tip probes (Omni International), and RNA was isolated using the Paris RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion/Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the RT 2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen) followed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with RT 2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen). cDNA samples from each time point were screened with RT 2 Profiler PCR Array Rat NFκB Signaling Pathway (Qiagen). Data were analyzed using the SABiosciences PCR Array Data Analysis Web Portal (www. qiagen.com/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/). Western Blotting. Western blotting was performed in samples from sham (n = 3) and treated brains obtained at 0.5, 6, and 12 h following sonication (n = 3 per time point). Protein (25 μg) was electrophoresed by SDS/PAGE on 4-12% Novex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) under reducing conditions and was transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA in TBS plus 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h and then were hybridized overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 2% BSA with rabbit or mouse primary antibodies against following phospho-and total proteins: protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3b), ERK, JNK, and p38-MAPK. All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology and were used in 1:1,000-1:2,000 dilutions. HIF1α, HMGB-1, and RAGE antibodies were from Thermo Fisher Scientific and were used in 1:1,000 dilutions. Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat antibodies against mouse or rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) used in 1:10,000 dilutions with 1 h incubation at room temperature. Protein bands were detected using the Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare), and the relative protein amount was measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).</p><p>Histological Staining. Rats (n = 3 per time point) were killed at 1, 6, and 24 h post pFUS and were perfused with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde. Fixed brains were embedded in paraffin or optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.) tissue-mounting medium and were sliced into 5-10-μm sections. Paraffin (p) and frozen (f) tissue sections were stained with H&amp;E and with IF for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Immunostaining of three sections from each animal detected ICAM, GFAP, Iba1, and albumin. Primary antibodies used for IHC were goat anti-ICAM, 1:20 (p) (AF583; R&amp;D Systems Inc.), rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:1,500 (f) (Ab 33922; Abcam), goat anti-Iba1, 1:100 (p) 1:200 (f) (019-19741; Wako Chemicals), and sheep anti-albumin, 1:100 (f) (Ab53435; Abcam). All the secondary antibodies were from Abcam and were used in 1:200 dilutions [goat anti-rabbit antibody (Ab102293; Abcam) for GFAP and Iba1; donkey anti-goat antibody (Ab150129; Abcam) for ICAM; and donkey anti-sheep antibody (Ab150178; Abcam) for albumin]. TUNEL + cells were detected with an in situ cell-death detection kit (AP 11684809910; Roche Life Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isotype control antibody stains are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>.</p><p>Macrophage Labeling. Three days before pFUS+MB, rats (n = 5) were injected via the tail vein with 8 mg/kg MicroTRACK biodegradable rhodamine encapsulated magnetic polymers (CL-01Q02-B-50; BioPal, Inc.). MRI was obtained at 3 T before and 6 d after pFUS+MB exposure. Rats were killed 6 d after sonication. Frozen sections (10 μm thick) were IF-stained for a macrophage marker, CD68, 1:200 (f) (Ab31630; Abcam). Sections were analyzed for colocalized CD68 and nanoparticle-associated rhodamine using Image J and were compared with the contralateral hemisphere.</p><p>Microscopy. Microscopy was performed with an Aperio ScanScope CS system equipped with a 20× air objective (NA = 0.75) (Leica Microsystems). Highmagnification (60×) images were taken with an Olympus BX61fluorescent microscope. A laser scanning confocal microscope (model 710; Carl Zeiss AG; www.zeiss.com/global/home.html) using Plan-Apochromat objectives (20× air, NA = 0.8) was used for confocal microscopy. Illumination was provided by argon-ion (Lasos, www.lasos.com), diode, and diode-pumped solid-state lasers (Roithner Lasertechnik, www.roithner-laser.com).</p><p>Histologic Analysis. Histological evaluation of the microscopy sections was performed at 20× magnification. Fold changes were based on cell counts that were normalized from 10 fields of view (FOV) per hemisphere from three rats using Image J. For GFAP staining, the area of fluorescent signal was quantified using Image J by setting thresholds from 10 FOV per hemisphere of three rats followed by normalization of the pixel area to the contralateral hemisphere.</p><p>Statistical Analysis. All values are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses and data presentation were performed with Prism (version 6, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Student's unpaired t tests were used for pairwise comparisons, and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests was used for multiple comparisons. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
