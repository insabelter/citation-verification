<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In South China, the Datangpo black shales (663 Ma-654.5 Ma) were deposited during the Cryognian interglacial time between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. Multi-geochemical proxies, including different iron speciation and relevant ratios (Fe HR /Fe T , Fe P /Fe HR and Fe T /Al ratios) and molybdenum concentrations, were used to reconstruct the paleo-depositional environment of this black shale horizon. The ratios of different iron species (Fe HR /Fe T N 0.38 and Fe P /Fe HR b 0.80) suggest an overall anoxic conditions (ferruginous) over the deposition of the black shales, although intermittent euxinic (Fe HR /Fe T N 0.38 and Fe P / Fe HR ≈ 0.80) and oxic (Fe HR /Fe T b 0.38) intervals could have occurred. Furthermore, Fe T /Al ratios (Fe T / Al ≤ 0.51) confirm that water column may not be persistent euxinia during the deposition of the Datangpo black shales. Meanwhile, molybdenum concentrations show a decreasing trend towards the top of the black shales, reconciling the gradual oxygenating trend during this period as stated above. Compared to δ 34 S Py values in the Mesoproterozoic deep ocean, more positive δ 34 S Py values of this study may result from a small size of sulfate reservoir. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon.</p></div>

The Snowball Earth hypothesis suggested that the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets during the Neoproterozoic glaciation epoches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hoffman et al., 1998)</ref>. In the aftermath of glaciations, several lines of evidence, including iron chemistry and sulfur isotopic data from China, Canada, Oman and Australia, indicate stepwise oxygenation of the postglacial Ediacaran ocean (635-542 Ma), stimulating the evolution of early animal life <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Canfield et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fike et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Komiya et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Maruyama and Santosh, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McFadden et al., 2008)</ref>.

Until now, variable geochemical signatures, i.e., abundance of iron species and their ratios, molybdenum (Mo) abundance, and sulfur isotopic data, were used to document the Ediacaran oceanic redox changes in South China <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bristow et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McFadden et al., 2008)</ref>. In contrast, in the absence of metazoan fossils during the Cryogenian Period (750-635 Ma), less attention was paid to the oceanic changes of that time.</p><p>Here, we use multi-proxies, including ratios of highly reactive iron (Fe HR ) to total iron (Fe T ) (Fe HR /Fe T ), pyrite iron (Fe P ) to highly reactive iron (Fe HR ) (Fe P /Fe HR ), total iron (Fe T ) to Al (Fe T /Al), and Mo concentrations, to illustrate the oceanic redox conditions, under which sulfur cycling was discussed as well based on the sulfur isotopic data of pyrite (δ 34 S py ) during the Cryogenian Period in South China.</p></div>

A southeast-facing (present orientation) passive continental margin on the Yangtze Block was subsequently developed in the course of breakup of the Rodinia Supercontinent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Thermal subsidence related to the post-rift extension of South China Block created significant accommodation space in which thick Middle-to-Late Neoproterozoic successions were deposited <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jiang et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang and Li, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Neoproterozoic stratigraphic successions in South China comprise well exposed, relatively unaltered glacial and interglacial deposits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). The Cryogenian Group unconformably overlies the slate rocks of the Banxi Group. Two main Cryogenian diamictite successions, the lower Jiangkou Group and the upper Nantuo Formation, have been recognized in South China. The interglacial Datangpo Formation of manganese-bearing shales, ∼ 10 m thick on the upper slope to ∼ 200 m thick on the lower slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang and Li, 2003)</ref>, sits on the glacial deposits of the Jiangkou Group. The Datangpo Formation includes the lower thinner black shales (∼30 m thick), the focus of this study, and the upper thicker grey shales (∼ 200 m thick) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). A pair U-Pb zircon ages of 663 ± 4 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zhou et al., 2004)</ref> and 654.5 ± 3.8 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhang et al., 2008)</ref> for the tuffaceous beds in the basal and topmost Datangpo Formation provides a constraint for the timing of this interglacial interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>In this study, we choose the Mingle section, where the interglacial Datangpo Formation comprises the lower 30 m-thick black shales and the upper 180 m-thick grey shales (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). 16 samples, each at approximately 2 m apart, were collected in the lower 30 m-thick black shales for geochemical analysis. For each sample, ca. 5 g of fresh shale was grinded to powder (200 mesh in size) in an automated agate mill.</p><p>Different iron species, including pyrite iron (Fe P ), dithioniteextractable iron (Fe D ) and highly reactive iron (Fe HR ), were analyzed in this study. Extraction of Fe D has followed the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Canfield (1989)</ref>. 0.2 g sample powder was firstly digested with a 10 ml buffer solution composed of 58.8 g/l tri-sodium citrate dihydrate (C 6 H 5 Na 3- O 7 •2H 2 O) and 20 ml/l acetic acid, then was added with approximate 0.5 g sodium dithionite. The concentrations of dithionite-extractable iron were determined by AAS at Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS). Pyrite iron (Fe P ) was extracted following the chromium reduction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Canfield et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chu et al., 1994)</ref>. Approximate 0.5-1.0 g samples were reacted with 40 ml of 1 M CrCl 2 in an N 2 gas. H 2 S produced from pyrite reduction by CrCl 2 was bubbled through a 2% AgNO 3 trap where it was precipitated as Ag 2 S. The Ag 2 S precipitate was dried and weighed to determine the concentration of pyrite sulfur, and the amount of iron bound in pyrite (Fe P ) was calculated with a molar Fe:S ratio of 1:2. Fe HR was determined by calculating through the relation as Fe HR =Fe P +Fe D .</p><p>Major elements, including total iron content (Fe T ), and Al were measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Ca. 1.2 g power samples were weighted and burned in a muffle oven at 1000 °C for the removal of organic carbon and pyrite in the samples. The residues were mixed with 6.0 g of Li 2 B 4 O 7 , and fused to glass beads in Pt crucibles at 1100 °C. All the beads were analyzed by XRF-1500 Sequential X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (SHIMADZU Inc.) at IGGCAS.</p><p>Element Mo was extracted from bulk, dried powders using HF/ HNO 3 /HClO 4 digestions. We analyze it for molybdenum on ICP-MS Element at IGGCAS. A set of Chinese national and USGS rock standard, GBW07107 (shale) and GXR5 (soil), were chosen for calibrating element concentrations of unknowns. Analytical accuracy is better than 5%.</p><p>For sulfur isotope analysis, Ag 2 S precipitate above was homogenized with cupric oxide and combusted under vacuum for a conversion to sulfur dioxide (approximate 15 mg of Ag 2 S and 150 mg of Cu 2 O were combusted at 1050 °C for 15 min and analyzed at IGGCAS on a Finnigan Delta S gas source mass spectrometer). Sulfur isotope results are generally reproducible within ±0.3‰.</p><p>Total carbon (TC%) and total inorganic carbon (TIC%) concentrations were measured with an Elementar high TOC 2 at IGGCAS. A Chinese national rock standard, GBW07402, was used. Accuracy was better than 3% for TC and TIC concentrations. TOC (total organic carbon) content is calculated by subtracting TIC from TC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Ratios of iron species</head><p>Ratios of different iron species, i.e., Fe HR /Fe T , Fe P /Fe HR and Fe T /Al ratios, are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Fe HR /Fe T ratios in the black shales of studied horizon vary from 0.10 to 0.88, averaging 0.50, in which three short-term negative spikes (N1 to N3) are unraveled, showing fluctuant variations of Fe HR /Fe T ratios. Fe P /Fe HR ratios vary from 0.09 to 0.80, averaging 0.50, mimicking well the variation pattern of Fe HR /Fe T ratios. Fe T /Al ratios vary from 0.03 to 0.58, averaging 0.25, similarly following the variation patterns of those ratios listed above.</p><p>Modern sediments deposited under an oxic water column generally produce a low proportion of Fe HR relative to Fe T contents, yielding a Fe HR /Fe T ratio of 0.38 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Raiswell and Canfield, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijsman et al., 2001a)</ref>. In contrast, sediments accumulated under an anoxic water column can have a higher proportion of Fe HR , thereby yielding a Fe HR /Fe T ratio greater than 0.38. Accordingly, most of our Fe HR /Fe T ratios are greater than 0.38, suggesting an overall anoxic conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). However, the appearance of three short-term negative spikes with Fe HR /Fe T ratios b0.38 indicates multiple incursions of oxic water masses in the context of anoxic water conditions. Furthermore, the upward decrease in Fe HR /Fe T ratios and increase in the timing for negative spikes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) implicate an overall oxygenating, although episodic, trend in oceanic condition. This scenario is further corroborated by the overlying grey shale successions corresponding to a sea level fall prelude to the Marinoan glaciation.</p><p>The Fe P /Fe HR ratio is a proxy representing the extent to which Fe HR has been converted to pyrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson and Raiswell, 2004)</ref>. Evidence from the Black Sea and other euxinic (or sulfidic) basins shows that  sediments deposited there commonly yield Fe P /Fe HR ratios greater than 0.80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson and Raiswell, 2004)</ref>; those deposited under anoxic, ferruginous water columns generally have Fe P /Fe HR ratios less than 0.80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Canfield et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Poulton et al., 2004)</ref>. Our data show that most of the samples with elevated Fe HR /Fe T ratios (N0.38) have Fe P /Fe HR ratios b0.80 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), suggesting an overall anoxic (ferruginous) rather than euxinic water columns under which the black shales were deposited, reconciling the redox condition as stated above. This oceanic condition is supported by evidence elsewhere, i.e., in the synchronous outer shelf and deep basin of Canada, Greenland, where Fe HR /Fe T ratios are greater than 0.38, but Fe P /Fe HR ratios are less than 0.80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Canfield et al., 2008)</ref>. However, we note that Fe P /Fe HR ratios for two samples (ML82, and ML60) approximating 0.8 could suggest the episodic occurrence of water column intermittent euxinia during the deposition of the black shales, reflecting a local or basin-scale scenario.</p><p>In addition, Fe T /Al is also useful as a paleo-redox proxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lyons and Severmann, 2006)</ref>. The typical modern euxinic basin like the Black Sea has the elevated Fe T /Al ratios (0.6 to 1.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lyons and Severmann, 2006)</ref>. Throughout the Datangpo black shales, Fe T /Al ratios are generally less than or approximate those of the average shales (Fe T / Al = 0.51) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Taylor and McLennan, 1985)</ref>. Therefore, together with the ratios of different iron species of the Datangpo black shales as mentioned above, Fe T /Al ratios further confirm that water column may not be persistent euxinia during the deposition of the Datangpo black shales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Mo concentrations</head><p>In the ocean, Mo exists primarily as the soluble molybdate complex (MoO 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2-</head><p>). A critical activity of hydrogen sulfide (ca. 50-250 uM HS -) would facilitate conversion of molybdate (MoO 4 2-) to thiomolybdates (MoO 4-x S x 2-) that are subsequently scavenged by sedimentary particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Helz et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zheng et al., 2000)</ref>. Because of the low background values (ca. 1-2 ppm), Mo is the most sensitive redox elements compared to the other trace metals. In order to discern the redox conditions, the elemental compositions are usually compared after normalizing the trace metal concentrations to Al, a proxy for aluminosilicate detritus <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tribovillard et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van der Weijden, 2002)</ref>. In addition, trace metal (TM) concentrations are expressed in terms of enrichment factors (EF TM ), where the Al-normalized metal concentration is compared to the average shale values <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wedepohl, 1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wedepohl, , 1991))</ref>: EF TM = TM/Al sample :TM/Al average shale . When EF TM N 1, the trace metal of interest is enriched relative to average shale. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> illustrate that enrichment in molybdenum occurs throughout the Datangpo black shales (2.5b EF Mo b 40.6, average =16.9). Additionally, the molybdenum concentrations show a decreasing trend, reconciling the oxic conditions suggested by different iron species ratios. On the other hand, we note that molybdenum concentrations and iron species ratios do not show similar fluctuations throughout the black shales. Therefore, molybdenum enrichment throughout the black shales may not be simply governed by the benthic redox potential in the late anoxic intervals. In fact, authigenic molybdenum enrichment requires the accumulation of free H 2 S as well as a source of dissolved Mo (MoO 4 2-) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tribovillard et al., 2006)</ref>. For example, during the Archean Eon, the low molybdenum concentrations (2-5 ppm) in the persistent euxinic water column could owe to small amounts of dissolved Mo (MoO 4 2-) resulting from weak oxidative weathering of continental materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Scott et al., 2008)</ref>. In the case, little molybdenum enrichment in the late anoxic intervals possibly results from decrease dissolved Mo (MoO 4 2-) owing to massive uptake by anoxic sediments.

During bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR), 32 S is preferentially reduced from source sulfate, producing a 32 S-riched sulfide (H 2 S) product <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canfield, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kaplan and Rittenberg, 1964)</ref>. The reaction of iron with H 2 S produces little to no isotopic fractionation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fry et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Price and Shieh, 1979)</ref>. In general, the magnitude of the fractionation between sulfate and sulfide is controlled by sulfate availability. Larger fractionations are typically expressed under non-limiting sulfate concentrations where microbes have a large reservoir of sulfate that allows them to dissimilate 32 S preferentially. In cases of the modern ocean like Black Sea with a sulfate concentration of about 28 mM, sulfur isotopic compositions in the shelf and basinal sediments are enriched in light isotope 32 S <ref type="bibr">(Wijsman et al., 2001b</ref>) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). On the other hand, smaller fractionations and positive δ 34 S Py values always occur (i.e. δ 34 S Py are equal or close to coeval δ 34 S sulfate ) when sulfate is limiting, i.e., throughout Precambrian time. For example, pyrites from the deep sulfidic basin were enriched in 34 S in the Australian Mesoproterozoic Roper Basin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Therefore, the more 34 S-enriched pyrites in the Datangpo black shales likely reflect a lower sulfate concentration in South China rift basin compared to those in the Australian Mesoproterozoic Roper Basin.</p><p>Multiple evidence indicate that the sulfate concentrations gradually increase over the Earth history <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anbar and Knoll, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kah et al., 2004)</ref>. However, the low sulfate concentrations could exist in the Cryogenian ocean, indicating that the sulfur cycling must significantly change during the Cryogenian Period. During the most severe ice ages in Earth history (Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations), the riverine flux of sulfate to the ocean could decrease because the hydrologic cycle was diminished during the glaciations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hoffman et al., 1998)</ref>. When ocean anoxia developed as a result of extensive ice cover, a substantial portion of the marine sulfate reservoir would have been removed via bacterial sulfate reduction and iron sulfide burial. Generally, as the Sturtian glaciation ended and the hydrologic cycle was reinvigorated, marine sulfate levels should have increased through the interglacial interval due to the enhanced oxidative weathering of continent. Nevertheless, the sulfate reservoir after the glaciation could be still small due to an extremely low background of sulfate concentrations in association with the Sturtian glaciation. Subsequently, the intermittent euxinic conditions stimulated by increase organic flux and sulfate concentrations occurred in the water column during the interglacial interval, suggested by iron species ratios (Fe HR /Fe T N 0.38 and Fe P / Fe HR ≈ 0.80). Meanwhile, the marked enrichments of Mo were seen in the lower-20 m Datangpo shales. Similarly, the above scenario appeared in the Archean Eon when low sulfate concentrations and enrichment of molybdenum (maximum value: 40 ppm) also concurrently occurred under a low atmospheric oxygen level (PO 2 is b10 -5 PAL (present atmospheric level)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anbar et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Farquhar and Wing, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pavlov and Kasting, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Reinhard et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Multiple ratios between iron species (Fe HR /Fe T , Fe P /Fe HR , and Fe T /Al) and Mo concentrations from the Datangpo black shales suggest that an overall anoxic (ferruginous) condition predominated over the deposition, although several short-term oxic and euxinic episodes interrupted. The superheavy δ 34 S Py values suggest a small size of sulfate reservoir during the interglacial epoch. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
