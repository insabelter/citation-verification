<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Episodic memories initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However, the engrams and circuits that support neocortical memory consolidation remain unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, critical for remote contextual fear memory, were rapidly generated during initial learning via inputs from both hippocampal-entorhinal cortex and basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, are maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p><p>Memories are thought to be initially stored within the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HPC-EC) (recent memory) and over-time are slowly consolidated within the neocortex for permanent storage (remote memory) (1-7). Systems memory consolidation models suggest that the interaction between the HPC-EC and the neocortex during and after an experience is crucial (8-12). Experimentally, prolonged inhibition of hippocampal or neocortical networks during the consolidation period produces deficits in remote memory formation (13-15). However, little is known regarding specific neural circuit mechanisms underlying the formation and maturation of neocortical memories through interactions with the HPC-EC network.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>circuit-specific manipulations and in vivo calcium imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, we investigated the nature and dynamics of neocortical and subcortical memory engram cells (a population of neurons that are activated by learning, have enduring cellular changes, and are reactivated by a part of the original stimuli for recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>) and their circuits for systems consolidation of memory.</p><p>We first traced entorhinal projections to frontal cortical structures (the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC)) involved in contextual fear memory, and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), with injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)-Alexa555 into these regions (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). CTB injections resulted in labeling in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) specifically in cells in layer Va (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-D</ref>, H and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A-D</ref>), indicating that MEC-Va cells have extensive projections to the neocortex and BLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. We then sought to inhibit these specific projections by bilaterally injecting adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV 8 )-calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase II (CaMKII):eArchT-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) in the deep layers of the MEC in wild-type (WT) mice with bilaterally implanted optic fibers above the PFC, cACC, or RSC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E,</ref><ref type="figure">J</ref>, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2G</ref>). Expression of eArchT-eYFP was abundant in MEC-Va terminals located in the PFC, cACC and RSC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>, and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D</ref>). These mice were then subjected to contextual fear conditioning (CFC) while we delivered green light bilaterally to the different cortical areas receiving MEC-Va projections during either the conditioning period (Day-1) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>) or recall test period (Day-2, Day-8, Day-15 and Day-22) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2F</ref>). Axon terminal inhibition with optogenetics of MEC-Va cells within the PFC during Day-1 of CFC disrupted memory at Day-15 and Day-22, but not at Day-2 or Day-8 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>). Terminal inhibition during memory recall tests did not affect memory retrieval (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). Finally, terminal inhibition in the cACC or RSC during CFC or recall had no effect on memory throughout these periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>-L and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2G-I</ref>).</p><p>The above results suggest that MEC-Va input into the PFC during CFC is crucial for the eventual formation of remote memory. This hypothesis was supported by several findings. First, CFC increased the number of c-Fos + cells in the PFC compared to that of homecage mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1M-O</ref>), whereas context only exposure did not increase c-Fos activity in the PFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1O</ref>). Second, optogenetic terminal inhibition of MEC-Va projections within the PFC during CFC inhibited the observed increase of c-Fos + cells in the PFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1O</ref>). Finally, we identified CFC engram cells in the PFC. We targeted injections of AAV 9 -c-fos:tTA and AAV 9 -TRE:channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1P,</ref><ref type="figure">Q</ref>) and optic fibres to the PFC of WT mice and labeled the PFC cells activated by CFC with ChR2 while the mouse was off doxycycline (OFF-Dox) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1R</ref>). Blue light stimulation at 4 Hz, but not the conventional 20 Hz, of ChR2-mCherry-expressing cells in the PFC induced freezing behavior on Day-2 and Day-12 in an unconditioned context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1S</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) compared with freezing under the blue light-off condition. This blue light-induced freezing was prevented when MEC-Va fibers in the PFC were inhibited during CFC on Day-1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1T</ref>, U, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). Using transsynaptic retrograde tracing combined with the activity-dependent cell labelling, we confirmed that the PFC engram cells generated by CFC receive monosynaptic input from MEC-Va cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1V-X</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</p><p>To examine whether PFC engram cells are also reactivated by the conditioned context (rather than by blue light) at a recent and remote time point, we targeted injections of AAV 9 -TRE: human histone H2B-green fluorescent protein (H2B-GFP) to the PFC of c-fos:tTA transgenic mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). The mice underwent CFC on Day-1 and then re-exposed to the conditioned (Context-A) or an unconditioned (Context-B) context on Day-2 or Day-13 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Cells activated by CFC were labeled with H2B-GFP and the cells activated by the context test with a c-Fos antibody, and we calculated the proportion of double labeled cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-B</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure">S6B</ref>). H2B-GFP + cells (PFC engram cells) were preferentially reactivated in Context-A on Day-13 but not Day-2, compared to the H2B-GFP negative cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). There was no difference in c-Fos expression between H2B-GFP positive and negative cells when mice were tested in Context-B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). We also found that the spine density of the PFC engram cells on Day-12 was significantly higher than on Day-2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>), in line with previous findings of a positive correlation between dendritic spine density on memory engram cells and memory expression triggered by natural recall cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>To test whether PFC engram cells are necessary for memory recall by natural cues, we bilaterally targeted injections of AAV 9 -c-fos:tTA and AAV 9 -TRE:ArchT-eGFP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>) and optic fibres to the PFC of WT mice and labeled the PFC engram cells that were activated by CFC with ArchT while the mice were OFF-Dox (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>). Cell body inhibition of the PFC engram cells by green light during retrieval did not affect recent memory (Day-2), however at the remote time-point (Day-12) memory retrieval was disrupted compared to the green light-off condition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</p><p>To further investigate the characteristics of PFC engram cells we monitored transient calcium (Ca 2+ ) events in PFC cells in vivo. WT mice were injected with AAV 5 -Syn:GCaMP6f into the PFC and implanted with a micro GRIN lens targeting the PFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G-I</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. On Day-1 mice were first exposed to Context-B followed by CFC in Context-A. Mice were then re-exposed to both contexts in the same order on Day-2 and Day-15 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2J</ref>). The averaged frequency of Ca 2+ events in PFC cells did not significantly change in either a time-or context-dependent manner (fig. <ref type="figure">S9B</ref>). However a small but significant difference was revealed in the cumulative distribution curves of a rate difference index (assessing context selectivity; see Methods) between Day-1 conditioning and Day-15 recall, and between Day-2 recall and Day-15 recall (fig. <ref type="figure">S9C</ref>). PFC cells did not appear to discriminate between the two contexts on Day-1 prior to footshock presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2K,</ref><ref type="figure">L</ref>). However, after footshock presentation, about 11% of cells showed a significant increase in Ca 2+ transients (shock responding cells; SR cells) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2K,</ref><ref type="figure">L</ref>). The remaining ~89% of PFC cells did not respond to the shocks (shock non-responding cells; SNR cells). The SR cells were less active than SNR cells during exposure to Context-B and Context-A on Day-1 prior to footshock presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2L-N</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure">S9D</ref>). During recall, the transient Ca 2+ activity of SR cells in Context-A (conditioned context) was significantly higher compared to that in Context-B on Day-15 but not on Day-1 or Day-2, whereas the frequency of Ca 2+ transient events in SNR cells remained constant, irrespective of context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2M,</ref><ref type="figure">N</ref>). This produced a significant rate difference index of Ca 2+ activity for the conditioned context between the SR and SNR cells on Day-15 but not on Day-1 (excluding the shock delivery period) or Day-2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2O</ref>). These results combined with c-Fos activation data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1M-O</ref>) suggest that the SR cells may be the PFC memory engram cells, given that the generation of the PFC engram cells requires both context exposure and footshocks.</p><p>Our calcium imaging data suggest that footshock stimulus input into the PFC is crucial for the generation of PFC engram cells. Because the BLA integrates footshock information arriving from the thalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> and projects to the PFC (fig. <ref type="figure">S5I</ref>, S10), we optogenetically inhibited the pathway from BLA to PFC during CFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2P</ref>). Optogenetic inhibition of BLA terminals in the PFC during CFC disrupted the generation of PFC engram cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2Q</ref>). The terminal inhibition during CFC also inhibited remote memory formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2R</ref>).</p><p>To test whether the HPC engram cells play a crucial role in the functional maturation of PFC engram cells during the system consolidation process, we bilaterally targeted injection of AAV 9 -TRE:tetanus toxin light chain (TeTX) or AAV 9 -TRE:eYFP (as a control) to the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of c-fos:tTA transgenic mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). When the mice were subjected to CFC, DG engram cells were labeled with TeTX. DG engram cell labeling with TeTX caused a robust inhibition of DG engram cell output, as revealed by greatly reduced immunoreactivity of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), which is essential for activity-dependent neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, within the stratum lucidum (s.l.) in hippocampal CA3 in OFF-Dox mice compared to ON-Dox mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). Optogenetic activation of DG engram cells with ChR2 failed to produce the increase in c-Fos + cells in CA3 of TeTX-expressing mice that was observed in control mice compared to home cage controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). TeTX expression in HPC engram cells inhibited the reactivation of PFC engram cells during exposure to the conditioned context 12 days after CFC compared to the eYFP control group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). TeTX expression also blocked the increase of dendritic spine density of PFC engram cells compared to the eYFP group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>). In vivo calcium imaging revealed that TeTX expression in HPC engram cells after CFC blocked the increase of the context discrimination index in SR cells in the PFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</p><p>To investigate the post-consolidation fate of HPC engram cells we crossed c-fos:tTA TG mice with TRE:H2B-GFP TG mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, subjected them to CFC, and then re-exposed them to the conditioned (Context-A) or an unconditioned (Context-B) context on Day-2 or Day-13 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3I-K</ref>). DG engram cells were preferentially reactivated in Context-A on Day-2 but not Day-13, compared to the non-engram cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3L</ref>). No difference was observed in the activation of DG engram and non-engram cells by Context-B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3L</ref>). We were unable to maintain labeled DG engram cells with ChR2 beyond 12 days with injection of AAV 9 -TRE:ChR2-mCherry. To extend this technical limit we targeted injections of AAV 1,5,8,9 -TRE:CCre, AAV 1,5,8,9 -TRE:NCre and AAV 5 -EF1a:ChR2-mCherry to the DG of c-fos:tTA transgenic mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3M</ref>). We could thus extend viable labelling by a few days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3N</ref>). The spine density of DG engram cells on Day-15 was significantly reduced compared to Day-5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3O</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>). On both Day-5 and Day-15, optogenetic activation of DG engram cells induced freezing behaviour (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3P,</ref><ref type="figure">Q</ref>).</p><p>We finally investigated the role of MEC-Va projections to the BLA in recent and remote memory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>). Inhibition of MEC-Va terminals in the BLA during CFC disrupted contextual fear memory formation. Retrieval was impaired at all time-points tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). When terminal inhibition was restricted to retrieval, recent memory tested on Day-2 and Day-8 was impaired, but remote memory retrieval on Day-15 and Day-22 was unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). In contrast, inhibition of PFC engram cell terminals in the BLA did not impair memory retrieval on Day-2 but did impair memory retrieval on Day-12 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). To investigate whether the BLA fear memory engram cells formed on Day-1 are maintained and used for PFC engram-dependent remote memory recall, we subjected the double transgenic mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>) to CFC and re-exposed them to the conditioned context at recent or remote time-points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref>). BLA engram cells were reactivated equally well by the conditioned context at both recent and remote time-points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>). Similarly, BLA cells activated by recent recall were reactivated again equally well by re-exposure to the conditioned context at recent and remote time-points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4J,</ref><ref type="figure">K</ref>).</p><p>Here, we found that PFC memory engram cells for CFC were rapidly formed during Day-1 training by virtue of inputs from both MEC-Va and BLA, but they were not retrievable with natural recall cues. The immature PFC engram cells functionally, structurally, and physiologically matured during the subsequent few weeks and this process required inputs from HPC engram cells presumably through MEC-Va. In contrast to their formation on Day-1, retrieval of the PFC engram at a remote time did not require MEC-Va input. HPC engram cells formed during training became silent with time; they are not retrieved on Day-14 by natural recall cues but are still re-activatable optogenetically for recall. However, fear memory BLA engrams formed during training are functionally maintained even after the consolidation-mediated switch in recall circuits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4L</ref>).</p><p>Our model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4L</ref>) introduces the concept that the prefrontal memory engram is already generated, albeit in an immature form, on Day-1 of training via inputs from both HPC-EC and BLA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The standard model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> hypothesized that remote memory is formed in the cortex by a slow transfer of hippocampal memory. In contrast, in our study the role of the hippocampus in cortical memory is for the rapid generation of immature engram cells in the PFC during training and for the subsequent functional maturation of these preexisting engram cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The immature PFC engram may correspond to the cortical "tagging" speculated in an earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Whereas in a previous study the BLA is crucial for both recent and remote fear memory expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, our results demonstrated an overlapping set of BLA engram cells for both recent and remote fear memory retrieval which were quickly formed during training (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). However, the source of input into the BLA engrams for retrieval shifts from MEC-Va at recent time-points to the PFC engram at remote time-points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4L</ref>). The route through which contextual stimuli activate the mature PFC engram is unknown. Most likely the information processed in a variety of sensory cortices reaches the PFC via the thalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Supporting this idea, PFC engram cells receive monosynaptic input from both the medial-dorsal and anteromedial thalamus (fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</p><p>Our finding of the lasting hippocampal engrams (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3Q</ref>) is consistent with multiple trace theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. However, at the post-consolidation stage, the hippocampal engrams were not activatable by natural recall cues, but with optogenetic stimulation. A similar state of hippocampal engrams has previously been observed in anisomycin-induced amnesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and in mouse models of early Alzheimer's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, and the early (Day-2) PFC engram cells showed a similar property (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1S,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Although we did not determine how long after encoding this "silent state" of the hippocampal engram lasts, we speculate that the hippocampal engram will eventually lose the original memory information <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, the silent engram cells may still participate in the successful remote recall of discrete episodic details <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</p><p>As in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>, we observed that training resulted in wide-spread neuronal activation in the neocortex, including the ACC and RSC. However, whereas the activation of PFC neurons is crucial for formation of remote memory, MEC-Va input into the cACC or RSC is dispensable for this process. For remote memory, the PFC may thus have a distinctive role compared to other neocortical areas in integrating multiple sensory information stored in various cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Finally, our data show that the remote memory expressed by the PFC engram is conditioned-context specific, suggesting that it is episodic-like.</p></div>
