<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The heavy-duty truck industry has always been regarded as an "economic vane," and as the carrier of production materials, its degree of cold and heat can better reflect the quality of the macroeconomic environment. The SAP system is currently the ERP software with the largest functions and the most sales and has been widely used by large domestic and foreign manufacturing enterprises. Because of its specific development for enterprises, it is also the most expensive ERP software in the world. This research integrates the existing information resources, takes SAP (system applications and products in data processing) system as the enterprise's information platform, unifies the information platform into SAP system by integrating the existing information resources (financial system, logistics system, cost control system, production control system, etc.), avoids the information island phenomenon as far as possible, and finally realizes the integrated and unified enterprise information management, which is convenient for the rapid traceability of historical data, providing the best decision analysis method for managers. It is possible to eliminate all non-value-added operations in the value chain, find out the point of cost reduction and efficiency increase, comprehensively optimize the production value chain, improve production efficiency, and finally achieve the purpose of this book. The project implementation of automobile company adopts independent minicomputer system (HP server), with SAPR/3 system as the core and C/S (customer/service) architecture, so as to gradually expand the system function in the future. From the comparison before and after the launch of the SAP project, the above two indicators have increased by 1.5 times, the order fulfillment rate has increased from 30% to 45%, and the timely delivery rate has increased from 60% to 90%. Effective cost control can reduce costs, produce products with larger output and better quality at the same cost, and enable enterprises to maintain an advantage in the competition; effective cost control can also enable enterprises to develop a variety of configurations at the same cost. Products meet the individual needs of customers. The design of this article makes the company's supply, production planning, logistics, and demand synchronized and integrated.</p></div>

The average interest rate of automobile manufacturing industry is reduced. In order to make the enterprise have enough competitiveness and healthy longterm development, it is more important to improve the inventory management level and reduce the enterprise cost. Many production-oriented enterprises are faced with the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>common problems, such as production shortage and waiting for materials, excessive inventory reserve, low inventory turnover rate, and serious sluggish phenomenon. Inventory proportion is high, there are many kinds, and the management is difficult, so the research on inventory management of automobile manufacturing enterprises has extensive reference significance <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Financial general ledger (manually processed business accounting vouchers, which can be queried through subject details), detailed data (supply chain module picking details, income details, etc.), and cost drivers are calculated through statistical indicators under the activity-based costing method and other data.</p><p>This study selects the successful case of SAP management system implemented by a medium-sized car manufacturer, an automobile company, to analyze its successful experience, hoping to inspire and help similar enterprises. Relatively speaking, the level of manufacturing industry in developed countries and regions is higher than that in developing countries. According to the actual situation of automobile manufacturing plants, the existing logistics distribution system is integrated, and a set of more suitable overall solution for automobile production control and logistics distribution system is formulated, which lays a good foundation for improving the level of workshop control and logistics management <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. This research puts forward the safeguard measures for automobiles to implement the standard activity-based costing method from four aspects: enterprise organization, activity-based costing system, personnel management and training, and implementation process.</p><p>With the substantial improvement of production technology and management level, the automobile market and consumption environment have been greatly improved, heralding the arrival of China's automobile consumption era. Croxton et al. provided the strategy and operation description of each of the eight supply chain processes determined. Although he provides a series of opportunities for researchers to further develop the field, the research process lacks data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. The main purpose of Samaranayake is to document the research related to the development of the conceptual framework of the supply chain. The framework he proposed is based on a unified structured technology, which combines the bill of materials, warehouse list, project network, and operation routes in the manufacturing and distribution network into one structure. He described the framework and illustrated digital examples in the manufacturing and distribution environment. Each network in the supply chain in his research provides integrated methods for planning and executing many components and can provide visibility, flexibility, and maintainability but is not certain to further improve the supply chain environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Wu believes that as the traditional supply chain becomes more and more intelligent, there is an unprecedented opportunity. He researches and explores the status quo and remaining issues of intelligent supply chain management. In addition, five key research topics were formulated and studied. According to the review questions defined in the research, he reviews, classifies, and analyzes the research in the above-mentioned subject areas. Although the topic of convergence of atoms and numbers in his research has attracted more and more attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, Gold mentioned that the endorsement of the point of view may dissolve the firm pursuit of profit and other economic performance goals in order to recall the real problem. Although he discussed how far the acknowledged theoretical point of view has taken root in the European institutionalized corporate social relations tradition, it cannot be regarded as a rediscovery of the true European manufacturing business <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection in countries around the world, the auto industry is bound to face new rectifications and challenges. For auto companies, how to effectively control costs during their operations is an important issue that cannot be ignored.</p><p>How to scientifically select suppliers as strategic partners of enterprises, strengthen information sharing and information exchange capabilities between enterprises and suppliers, and achieve seamless connection of supply chain systems has gradually become a new demand for enterprise procurement management. This study mainly discusses the design and implementation of supply chain management system for automobile manufacturing enterprises based on SAP. This research integrates the existing information resources, takes SAP system as the enterprise's information platform, unifies the information platform into SAP system by integrating the existing information resources (financial system, logistics system, cost control system, production control system, etc.), avoids the information island phenomenon as far as possible, and finally realizes the integrated and unified enterprise information management, which is convenient for the rapid traceability of historical data, providing the best decision analysis method for managers. The project implementation of automobile company adopts independent minicomputer system (HP server), with SAPR/3 system as the core and C/S (customer/service) architecture, so as to gradually expand the system function in the future. According to the idea of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) management system and combined with the actual situation of the enterprise, the functions of the system include warehouse area management, material basic information management, inventory operation management, inventory operation management, and statistical query management. The process of material information input can transfer material master data information with SAP system through blockchain technology. This study is helpful to provide guidance for the long-term development of enterprises. From the perspective of sustainable supply chain partnership, the determination principles of sustainable supply chain partners and the main factors affecting partner selection can be analyzed, and the evaluation index system of sustainable supply chain partner selection is established accordingly.</p></div>

However, in this project, the sales company does not implement sales and distribution ser-vices for the time being. The main function of the sales system is to sell the products of the manufacturing company to the catalog company and to distribute the catalog. The whole vehicle purchased by the company is sold to the sales company (5) Other departments ① Technical department: master data management, including material master data, BOM, work center, and process route ② Operation management office: information system, performance appraisal, and comprehensive management ③ Quality department: supplier quality management 3.2. System Architecture Design. The project implementation of the automobile company adopts an independent minicomputer system (HP server and SAPR/3 system as the core), adopts C/S (customer/service) architecture, and gradually expands system functions in the future (B/S structure). Some of the notable advantages of the company are simple optimization and faster and more convenient system upgrades; no matter how many clients need to be upgraded, you only need to upload the required plugins online; the information is fully shared and transparent, not only the inventory information between the various departments of the enterprise sharing, and suppliers can also see all shipping information, avoiding a lot of disputes caused by missing information; network requirements are reduced, saving internal hardware requirements of the enterprise, you can directly query the required data on the browser, and you do not need to store a lot of data yourself. From a comprehensive analysis point of view, the use of the B/S structure is more able to meet the needs of enterprise operation and management. Here, the B/S structure needs to be enabled, and the network topology structure is required to realize the connection of the software and hardware structure of the entire system. The network topology of the system is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">System Function Module Design.</head><p>According to the company's existing SAP system, the E-supply system, and the customer's KMS Kanban pull system that are not fully used, a simple and easy-to-operate inventory management system is designed on the basis of these three systems. It can realize basic functions such as management of enterprise internal inventory, customer receipt and reconciliation management, and supplier delivery reconciliation management, which brings opportunities for the small-scale A company to be quickly put into use. The functions of each module of the information system are introduced as follows:</p><p>(   Step-by-step implementation refers to the process, and system plan is divided into several components; each part is designed, implemented, and delivered in batches according to the order of completion. The overall implementation requires more resources in a certain period of time, but the overall implementation time is shorter.</p><p>Step-by-step implementation is mainly used for projects with limited resources. It requires less investment in a certain period of time, but it will prolong the implementation cycle of the project. Based on years of project experience, the implementation team believes that the overall implementation efficiency is better than stepwise implementation.</p><p>(1) Using a step-by-step implementation strategy, the system schemes completed in the previous batch are likely to be readjusted during the design and implementation of the latter batch of schemes. Moreover, every time the system function is expanded, the whole system scheme must be reintegrated test to ensure the integration of the system, and the users must also gather for retraining. These repetitive tasks will consume time. The overall implementation strategy is adopted, all processes are defined in the same time period, all system solutions are designed, implemented, and tested in the same time period, and all user training and permission definitions are also completed in the same time period, thereby avoiding step-by-step implementation causes rework problems</p><p>(2) Using a step-by-step implementation strategy, the project implementation team will face the dual work pressure of support and implementation within the same time period. It will not only provide support for the system that has been put into use but also carry out the design and development of new functions. On the contrary, the overall implementation strategy clearly defines the main tasks and key submissions of each stage. The project team members only need to focus on the most important tasks in this stage within the same time period, and the quality of work can be fully guaranteed</p><p>(3) Adopting a step-by-step implementation strategy will take up more time for project team members and will affect the normal operation of the enterprise for a longer time. With the overall implementation strategy, with the exception of some support personnel, most members of the project team can be released to invest in other work or projects after the completion of the system support handover. Based on the above considerations, the automobile company adopts an overall implementation strategy, which is conducive to shortening the project time, saving project costs, and improving implementation efficiency</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and Discussion</head><p>4.1. SAP System Usage Analysis. The importance of ERP training SAP is a set of highly information-based management software. If you want to fully apply SAP software, you must understand a lot of knowledge, IT knowledge and business management knowledge. Therefore, if you want SAP to serve the enterprise, to enhance the enterprise, it is necessary to carry out technical training vigorously, and the implementation of ERP must not be an optional tool. Therefore, it is necessary to train the company on the principles of ERP, train the principles and functions of ERP, why do you want to go to ERP, let the company have a full understanding, and also train the management so that leaders should pay enough attention to the role of ERP in the company and support the implementation of ERP and be able to lead the team to implement ERP effectively. Only when the leaders of the enterprise pay attention to it, the grassroots employees can pay attention to it. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>is very important in enterprises. Not only need to carry out theoretical training, but also to carry out operation and application training for grassroots employees, which can improve the efficiency of daily work. The comparison of the work efficiency of employees before and after training is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>During the project implementation process, the implementing party assisted the automobile company base to introduce advanced management concepts and refined the ideas through process design. After implementing the SAP ERP system, automobile manufacturing company A has realized the whole process of automation of the company's business process from sales order to order delivery, and the whole process can be carried out under the supervision and control of management personnel. This complete and lean management model has significantly improved the order fulfillment rate and timely delivery rate of automobile manufacturing company A. From the comparison before and after the launch of the SAP project, the above two indicators have increased by 1.5 times, the order fulfillment rate has increased from 30% to 45%, and the timely delivery rate has increased from 60% to 90%. The order situation of the automobile manufacturing company is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>Faced with the challenges of mixed-line production requiring timely and accurate distribution and reducing inventory, the SAP system realizes efficient coordination and information sharing of production, inventory, and procurement and flexibly supports JIT (Just-In-Time) Kanban, VMI supplier management inventory, etc. A variety of business models improve the efficiency of business processing and achieve the purpose of full logistics collaboration. Based on the status quo of basic management and information construction of an automobile company, the goal of this project is to establish a new core operating system for the base through the implementation of the SAP system and to lay a solid foundation for the development of the base business in City A. Due to the successful launch and smooth opera-tion of the SAP ERP system, the overall informatization level of car manufacturing company A has been greatly improved, which has improved the communication efficiency between departments, headquarters, and branches and indirectly increased the overall operating costs of the group. After the SAP ERP system went live, the total turnover of automobile manufacturing company A increased from RMB 8.2 billion to RMB 12 billion in two years. The specific economic benefits are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref>.</p><p>In the process of implementing the SAP ERP system in car manufacturing company A, the manpower of key departments was organized, and the master data of each module was cleaned and converted, which ensured that the SAP project of car manufacturing company A can be successfully launched.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This study mainly discusses the design and implementation of supply chain management system for automobile manufacturing enterprises based on SAP. This research integrates the existing information resources, takes SAP system as the enterprise's information platform, unifies the information platform into SAP system by integrating the existing information resources (financial system, logistics system, cost control system, production control system, etc.), avoids the information island phenomenon as far as possible, and finally realizes the integrated and unified enterprise information management, which is convenient for the rapid traceability of historical data, providing the best decision analysis method for managers. The project implementation of automobile company adopts independent minicomputer system (HP server), with SAPR/3 system as the core and C/S (customer/service) architecture, so as to gradually expand the system function in the future. The functions of the system include warehouse area management. The process of material information input can transfer material master data information with SAP system through blockchain technology. This study is helpful to provide guidance for the long-term development of enterprises. The establishment of the supply chain of this paper is centered on the vehicle manufacturer. Under this model, the position of parts manufacturers, dealers, and other members and how the thinking of enterprise informatization construction should be coordinated with the vehicle manufacturers also need to be further studied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SAP system (http://alturl.com/x8bn6).</figDesc><graphic coords="5,196.96,129.09,100.84,94.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
