<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of human death after cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, especially in the developing and the undeveloped countries. According to the article published in the CA magazine "Global Cancer Statistics, 2012", there were 14 million new cancer cases in the world in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Metal complexes constitute an important class of compounds of biological interest because of their natural propensity to interact with DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Due to their cationic characteristics, a wide spectrum of ligands, a broad range of structural geometries and electronic properties as well as kinetic properties and mechanisms of drug action, metal complexes have been widely studied and potentially used in gene regulation, probing of DNA specific structures and interactions, and the design of therapeutic agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As a unique class of crystalline materials constructed via self-assembly of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands, coordination polymers (CPs) have rapidly emerged in chemistry and materials science due to their new topological structures as well as versatile potential applications such as gas storage/separation, catalysis, magnetism, optics, and chemical sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, the rational design and synthesis of CPs with targeted properties and functionality have been a challenge for the synthetic chemistry. In general, the self-assembly of well-designed metal ions/clusters nodes and organic ligands is one of the most effective and available methods for preparing targeted CPs. Among various organic ligands, aromatic dicarboxylates and bis(imidazolyl)-substituted ligands are common linkers for constructing CPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.

In addition, the shape of organic ligands also affects the topology of targeted CPs. On the other hand, the self-assembly of CPs is influenced by many factors, such as metal-to-ligand molar ratios, coordination abilities of the ligands, the types of metal ions and solvent molecules, reaction temperatures, counter ions, pH values of the reaction systems and reaction medium, etc. Therefore, the investigation of the relationship between reaction conditions and the final structures can lead us to the design and synthesis of CPs with fantastic structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this study, two new mixed-ligand CPs [Zn(bdc)(bib)] n (1, H 2 bdc = 1,3-dicarboxybenzene, bib = 1,3bis(imidazol-1-yl)benzene) and [Zn(NH 2 -bdc)(bib)] n (2, NH 2 -H 2 bdc = 2-amino-1,4-dicarboxybenzene) have been successfully prepared by the reaction of zinc nitrate, N-containing and dicarboxylate ligands under the same hydrothermal conditions. The CCK-8 results suggested that compound 1 exhibited the outstanding anticancer activity rather than compound 2. Moreover, the apoptosis detection indicated that compound 1 significantly induced the apoptosis production in SW480 colon cancer cells, and the ROS measurement proved the apoptosis to be initiated by the up-regulation of ROS in cancer cells. The X-ray data were obtained by the Oxford Xcalibur E diffractometer with MoK α radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The intensity data were analyzed using the CrysAlisPro software and converted to the HKL files. The olex2.solve embedded in the OLEX 2 software was used to get the structural models, and the SHELXL-2014 program based on the least-squares approach was modified <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. All non-H atoms were mixed with anisotropic parameters. Then we utilized the AFIX commands to fix all H atoms geometrically on the C atoms to which they are attached. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> summarizes the refinement details as well as crystallographic parameters of the two complexes. Cell viability analysis. Stock solutions of compounds 1 and 2 were prepared in DMSO (Sigma Aldrich) at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL via grinding the crystalline samples in a mortar with a pestle for 1 h and then treated via ultrasound. The powders were sterilized by filtration through Millipore filter (0.22 μM) before use, and diluted by the cell culture medium to various working concentrations. The cell viability of SW480 colon cancer cells treated with the compounds was determined with the CCK-8 detection kit as described previously. In short, the SW480 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates with a density of 1⋅10 and replaced with a CCK-8 solution in 100 μL of the culture medium. Finally, the optical density (OD) values were measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Cell viability (%) was calculated according to the following formula: viability (%) = (OD sample -OD blank )/(OD control -OD blank )⋅100%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>Cell apoptosis analyzed by flow cytometry. The Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit was applied for the SW480 cell apoptosis determination according to the protocol described previously. In brief, the SW480 of 2⋅10 5 cells/well were seeded into six-well plates and cultured at a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 incubator overnight. Then, serious dilutions of compounds 1 and 2 were added to cells for 24 h treatment. Subsequently, the SW480 cells were trypsinized, harvested, washed three times with PBS and stained with 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of propidium iodide (PI) for 10 min in dark at room temperature. Finally, the cell samples were analyzed by flow cytometry immediately (FACSVerse, BD, San Jose, CA) and the CellQuest software (FACSCalibur). All experiments were repeated three times. Intracellular ROS detection. The intracellular ROS accumulation of SW480 cells after treatment with compounds 1 and 2 was measured by the DCFH-DA assay following the protocols. Briefly, the SW480 cells were planted onto six-well plates at the density of 2⋅10 5 cells per well and cultivated at a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 wet environment. After that, different concentrations of compounds 1 and 2 were used for cancer cell treatment. After 24 h treatment, the SW480 cells were harvested and incubated with 10 μM DCFH-DA solution for 30 min at 7 °C, 5% CO 2 . The ROS level was determined by a flow cytometer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Molecular structures. Complex 1 could be prepared by the solvothermal reaction of bib, H 2 bdc, and Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ⋅6H 2 O (29.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) in a mixed DMF-MeOH-H 2 O solvent at 85 °C for 5 days. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2 1 /c with an asymmetric unit consisting of a divalent Zn(II) atom, a 1,3-bib ligand, and a fully deprotonated H 2 bdc ligand. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure"></ref>   <ref type="formula">9</ref>) Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). Zn(II) ions are bridged by bdc 2-ligands to generate a 1D left-handed [Zn(bdc)] n single helical chain with a pitch of 13.324(1) Å; the distance between two adjacent Zn(II) ions is 8.126(2) Å and the Zn-Zn-Zn angle is 110.015(6)°. In addition, another one-dimensional (1D) right-handed [Zn(bdc)] n single helical chain is also formed in the structure of 1. Furthermore, these 1D left-and right-handed helical chains are connected by [Zn 2 (bib) 2 ] n clusters to generate a 2D framework oriented parallel to the (102) crystal planes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). Further insight into the nature of this intricate framework can be acquired using the topological analysis, which was performed with the TOPOS software. From a topological point of view, if the [Zn 2 (bib) 2 ] n clusters are considered as 4-connected nodes, the bdc 2-ligands are reduced to linkers and the whole framework can be simplified as a 4-connected network with a (4,4) topology. The structure of 1 is further stabilized by the π-π stacking interaction between the adjacent bdc 2-ligands in the adjacent layers with a distance of 3.791(2) Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</p><p>Complex 2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4 3 . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, the asymmetric unit consists of one crystallographically independent Zn(II) ion, one partially deprotonated NH 2 -bdc 2-ligand, and one neutral bib ligand, all of which contribute to a neutral framework structure. The coordination environment of the central metal Zn(II) ion and the coordination modes of ligands are similar to that of complex 1, which is completed by two carboxylate O atoms from two NH 2 -bdc 2-ligands and two N atoms from two bib ligands, forming a distorted tetrahedral coordination surrounding. Notably, each four-coordinated Zn(II) ion is connected by two NH 2 -bdc 2-ligands and two bib ligands to form a 3D neutral framework with a large porosity, which are large enough to include another three similar networks to form a closely packed network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). Comparing with the coordination geometry of the Zn(II) cation in 1, the Zn(II) cation in 2 is also in the tetrahedral environment. Thus, the overall topology of the framework of complex 2 can be simplified as a 4-connected 3D dia   network. Further, five such networks interpenetrate mutually to give a dense structure, making a fourfold interpenetrated framework (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>). The π⋯π stacking interactions in complex 2 occur between bib and NH 2 -bdc 2-ligands.</p><p>To confirm that the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, PXRD experiments were carried out for 1 and 2. The experimental and simulated PXRD patterns of the corresponding compounds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) show that the bulk synthesized materials and the measured single crystals are the same. In view of the following bioactivity tests, it is necessary to study the stability of these two compounds in the DMSO solution. The freshly as-prepared two complexes were firstly ground in a mortar with a pestle for 1 h and then soaked in the DMSO solution for two days. Then the corresponding PXRD patterns were measured, which reflected that the PXRD patterns of the treated samples were comparable with those of the asprepared samples, indicating their good framework stability in the DMSO solution.</p><p>Effect of the compounds on the SW480cell viability. The cytotoxic effects of compounds 1 and 2 on SW480 colon cancer cells were examined by the CCK-8 assay. The cells were exposed to various concentrations of the compounds for 24 and measured in a microplate reader. As the results show (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), treatment with compound 1 significantly reduced the cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. However, compound 2 could hardly reduce the SW480 cell viability (a). The H 2 bdc, bib, and NH 2 -H 2 bdc ligands showed no cytotoxic activity on HEK-293 human cells (b). Compound 1 induces apoptosis in SW480 colon cancer cells. To determine whether the apoptosis is responsible for the inhibition of the cell viability induced by compound 1, the flow cytometry assay was performed. To quantify the SW480 colon cancer cell apoptosis, SW480 cells treated with compounds 1 and 2 were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 74.65%, which was significantly higher than that after treatment with compound 2. This indicated that compound 1 had a stronger ability in inducing SW480 cell apoptosis than compound 2.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Compound 1 increases the intracellular ROS accumulation in SW480 colon cancer cells. The increased production of ROS was involved in the induction of cell apoptosis. Thus, we examined the ROS level in SW480 cells after treatment with compounds 1 and 2 by DCF fluorescence in flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, compound 1 increased the level of SW480 intracellular ROS to 89.21%, which is notably higher than that after treatment with compound 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In summary, we have obtained two mixed-ligand CPs by the reaction of zinc nitrate, N-containing and dicarboxylate ligands under the same hydrothermal conditions. Their structures have been fully studied via single crystal X-ray diffraction along with the elemental analysis. The structure solution and refinement results show that complex 1 has a 2D layered network with a 4-connected sql network, and complex 2 demonstrates a 3D diamond frameworks with a fourfold interpenetration. In addition, we explored the anticancer activity of compounds 1 and 2 in vitro, as well as its underlying mechanism. CKK-8 indicated the excellent anti-viability capability against SW480 colon cancer cells. The study of the mechanism reveals the anticancer activity of compound 1 due to the induction of ROS-mediated cell apoptosis, which provides a potential candidate for liver cancer treatment.</p></div>
