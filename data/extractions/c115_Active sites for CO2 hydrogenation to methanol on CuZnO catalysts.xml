<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The active sites over commercial copper/zinc oxide/aluminum oxide (Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ) catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) hydrogenation to methanol, the Zn-Cu bimetallic sites or ZnO-Cu interfacial sites, have recently been the subject of intense debate. We report a direct comparison between the activity of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu model catalysts for methanol synthesis. By combining x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we can identify and characterize the reactivity of each catalyst. Both experimental and theoretical results agree that ZnCu undergoes surface oxidation under the reaction conditions so that surface Zn transforms into ZnO and allows ZnCu to reach the activity of ZnO/Cu with the same Zn coverage. Our results highlight a synergy of Cu and ZnO at the interface that facilitates methanol synthesis via formate intermediates.</p><p>T he leading catalysts currently used in industry for hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol (CO 2 + 3H 2 → CH 3 OH + H 2 O) (1-3) are Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 . The efforts to understand the nature of active sites in Cu/ZnO (4-7) have led to debate about the role of ZnO <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>. One possibility is that there is an intimate synergy between Cu and ZnO at the interface, where ZnO could act as a structural modifier, hydrogen reservoir, or direct promoter for bond activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. The other possibility is that a highly active ZnCu alloy forms by partial reduction of ZnO or a decoration of Cu with metallic Zn <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>.</p><p>Although a recent experiment observed higher activity of ZnCu silicate than Cu/ZnO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>, little was known about the sites on the top layer of the system that catalyzed the overall reaction due to the limitations in experimental techniques.</p><p>To describe the active sites on the surface, theoretical calculations were carried out to provide mechanistic understanding of methanol synthesis from CO 2 on either Cu/ZnO(000ī) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref> or Zndecorated Cu(211) step edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>. Furthermore a recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study revealed the formation of a ZnO overlayer on top of the Cu particles in an industrial Cu/ ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst under reaction conditions (4) that could form a catalytically active metaloxide interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we report a direct comparison of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu model catalysts during CO 2 hydro-genation to methanol using a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. Experimentally, Cu(111), ZnCu(111), ZnO/Cu(111), Cu/ZnO(000ī), and ZnO/Cu/ZnO(000ī) model systems were synthesized for systematic comparison. Theoretically, the direct mechanistic comparison between ZnCu(211), an active phase for ZnCu alloy identified previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>, and ZnO/Cu(111) was made. In this way, the experiments on wellcharacterized model surfaces can be strongly coupled with the theoretical calculations, which provides more insight into the active sites than the previous experiment-theory combined studies on methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO catalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>.</p><p>The ZnCu(111) and ZnO/Cu(111) model surfaces were synthesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref> to simulate ZnCu alloy and the inverse ZnO/Cu motif observed previously with TEM (4-6). For the clean Cu(111) substrate, under a pressure of 4.5 atm of H 2 and 0.5 atm of CO 2 at 575 K, a turnover frequency (TOF) was determined for the synthesis of methanol of 0.006 molecules site -1 s -1 , which is near the value of 0.008 reported for polycrystalline copper and smaller by a factor of 5 than the value of 0.032 molecules site -1 s -1 reported for Cu(110), under similar conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the more open Cu(110) surface is more active than Cu(111) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>. In all cases, very low methanol yields were observed on Cu(111) (0.1 × 10 13 to 1.1 × 10 13 CH 3 OH molecules cm -2 s -1 ). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, the catalytic activity increased after ZnO was deposited on the copper substrate, which reached a maximum at ~0.2 monolayer (ML) and then decreased with the increasing ZnO coverage, similar to the behavior seen upon deposition of this oxide on polycrystalline copper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>. Thus, the exposure of both ZnO and Cu sites or the optimization of the ZnO-Cu interfacial site is required to enhance the methanol production. During the hydrogenation of CO 2 , a large amount of CO is produced through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20)</ref>. For the production of CO (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), the same trends were found as for the CO 2 → methanol conversion. After depositing ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) on Cu(111), the reaction rates were 5 to 18 times as fast as that reported on the most reactive surface of copper, Cu(110) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>.</p><p>The as-prepared ZnO/CuO x /Cu(111) systems ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) were transformed into ZnO/Cu(111) after reaction. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> shows the typical Zn 2p 3/2 XPS spectra collected after reaction, and the measured peak position is near 1021.6 eV. The range for Zn 2+ is 1021.6 to 1021.7 eV, and that for Zn 0 is 1021.1 eV <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21)</ref>. Thus, under a CO 2 /H 2 reaction feed that was rich in H 2 , the ZnO/Cu system was stable, and no sign was seen for a ZnO/Cu → ZnCu transformation. We exposed the ZnO/Cu(111) catalysts to 20 atm of H 2 at the typical temperatures used for methanol production, and after evacuation of the gas without exposure to air, we did not detect any reduction of ZnO in the XPS measurements.</p><p>Our studies indicated that the ZnCu(111) surfaces were not stable under reaction conditions as Zn eventually transformed into ZnO. This result is consistent with a previous study for Zn on polycrystalline copper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, at both 525 and 550 K, the activity of Cu(111) precovered by 0.2 ML of Zn was initially low and increased with time until reaching values that matched those reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> for 0.2 ML of ZnO on Cu(111). According to the XPS measurements in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>, such activity variation was accompanied by the shift in the corresponding Zn 2p 3/2 peak positions measured after a given reaction time, evolving from a binding energy of ~1021.1 eV (Zn) to 1021.65 eV (ZnO). The Zn → ZnO transformation was accompanied by an increase in the catalytic activity for methanol production, and the optimal composition for CO 2 conversion to methanol was ZnO/Cu(111).</p><p>We also investigated the CO 2 → methanol conversion on the model Cu/ZnO(000ī) and ZnO/Cu/ ZnO(000ī) catalysts. The Cu/ZnO(000ī) catalysts were prepared following the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>. Copper grows on the O-terminated (000ī) face of ZnO to form two-dimensional (2D) particles at low coverages (&lt;0.15 ML) and 3D particles at high coverages <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> shows the results for the production of methanol on Cu/ ZnO(000ī) at 550 K. The clean ZnO surface was not active until Cu was present. Small particles of Cu deposited on ZnO(000ī) were the most active because of the higher concentration of corner or edge atoms. The best Cu/ZnO(000ī) catalyst in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> exhibited a lower activity than the best ZnO/Cu(111) inverse catalyst in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.</p><p>The presence of ZnO NPs likely facilitated the ZnO-Cu interactions. To obtain this type of interaction, and to mimic the ZnO/Cu/ZnO configuration observed with the TEM images for powder catalysts (4), we vapor-deposited 0.4 ML of ZnO onto the Cu/ZnO(000ī) surface. The deposited ZnO likely landed on both the ZnO(000ī) substrate and the Cu NPs to form inverse oxide/metal catalysts. A large increase in catalytic activity and the shift of the maximum to the high Cu coverage occurred when going from Cu/ZnO(000ī) to ZnO/ Cu/ZnO(000ī) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), demonstrating the importance of inverse systems and the presence of an active ZnO-Cu interface for methanol synthesis on Cu/ZnO catalysts. After exposing the most active ZnO/Cu/ZnO(000ī) catalysts to 20 atm of H 2 at 525 to 575 K in a high-pressure reactor, we found no sign of ZnO reduction in the postreaction XPS measurements.</p><p>To gain further mechanistic understanding of methanol synthesis from CO 2 on the ZnCu(111) and ZnO/Cu(111) model catalysts, DFT calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref> were performed on ZnCu(211) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) to describe ZnCu alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> and Zn 6 O 7 H 7 /Cu(111) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) to model the ZnO-Cu interface (3). Following previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>, two main reaction pathways for CO 2 conversion to methanol were considered in our calculations: (i) The RWGS reaction to produce a CO intermediate followed by its hydrogenations to methanol (RWGS + COhydro pathway) and (ii) initial hydrogenation of CO 2 to a *HCOO intermediate followed by its hydrogenation and dissociation to methanol (formate pathway).</p><p>In agreement with previous calculations (5), the present DFT results also show the slightly preferred formate pathway on ZnCu(211) via *HCOOH, *H 2 COOH, and *CH 3 O intermediates over the RWGS + CO-hydro pathway for methanol synthesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Herein, CO 2 hydrogenation may proceed through an Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism, as is the case for pure Cu catalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref> due to the unfavorable CO 2 binding at the Zn-Cu hybrid site (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> and table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). CO is expected to be the main product along the RWGS + COhydro pathway, and only a small amount of *HCO can be further hydrogenated to *CH 3 OH, as is that along the formate pathway. In addition, the current calculations also included the direct dissociation of *CO 2 to *CO + *O. The strong oxygen affinity of Zn sites makes the *O formation more kinetically favorable than hydrogenation to *HOCO [activation energy (E a ) = 0.99 eV] and competitive with its hydrogenation to *HCOO (E a = 0.77 eV). Because the hydrogenation of *O at the Zn sites to *OH (E a = 1.21 eV) is rather difficult, *O species are likely to be stabilized on the surface and lead to the formation of a ZnO layer during the CO 2 hydrogenation reaction, as was seen in the experiments for ZnCu(111) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</p><p>On ZnO/Cu(111), the stabilization of reaction intermediates involved in CO 2 hydrogenation requires Cu, Zn, or the synergy of both sites, and the ZnO-Cu interface likely provides multiple active sites for the reaction (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). CO 2 is activated in a similar way on ZnO/Cu(111) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) as that on ZnCu(211) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Again the formate pathway likely dominates for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol. Along the RWGS + CO-hydro pathway, although CO is still the major product, desorption is more favorable than on ZnCu(211) because of weakened CO binding and hindered hydrogenation to *HCO (tables S1 and S2).</p><p>The results from our KMC simulations under the experimental conditions (18) were consistent with the DFT predictions, showing that CO 2 hydrogenation favored the formate pathway on both systems. On pure Cu catalysts, *HCOO species are identified as only spectators for methanol synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>. For both ZnCu and ZnO/Cu systems, the addition of Zn or ZnO helps in stabilizing the *HCOOH intermediates via direct Zn-O interaction (figs. S3 and S4) and in activating *HCOO via hydrogenation. The rate for the methanol production on ZnCu(211) is very low and quickly decays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). First, the low conversion rate is associated with the activated hydrogenations of *HCOO to *HCOOH (E a = 1.19 eV). In addition, the reverse reaction, *H + *HCOO → *HCOOH, is more facile (E a = 0.50 eV) than the forward reaction. Thus, the *HCOOH intermediate is not stable but decomposes back to *HCOO. As a result, the strongly bound *HCOO species occupy the surface sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>), in agreement with the previous XPS study and DFT calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20)</ref>. Furthermore, the production of methanol is also hindered by *H 3 CO hydrogenation to *CH 3 OH (E a = 1.49 eV), although the accumulation of *H 3 CO is not as much as that of *HCOO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). The strong binding of *HCOO and *H 3 CO with the surface likely poisons the catalyst, and the production of methanol decreases over time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</p><p>The accumulation of *O species (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) is associated with *CO 2 dissociation to *CO + *O at the Zn sites of ZnCu(211) and is facilitated by the high activation barrier to hydrogenation to *OH (E a = 1.21 eV), leading to the transformation of Zn to ZnO. The combination of ZnO and Cu leads to a steady methanol production at a rate much greater than that on ZnCu(211) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). The *O species on ZnCu(211) are promoters instead of surface poisoning agents in this case. Accordingly, the methanol production rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>) for ZnCu(211) likely increases to the level observed on ZnO/Cu due to the formation of *O and ZnO after ~900 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</p><p>The enhanced methanol production on ZnO/ Cu(111) is attributed to the facile key elementary  steps. For CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol on ZnO/Cu(111), the hydrogenation of *H 3 CO is no longer rate-controlling (E a = 0.56 eV), as is that on ZnCu(211). The bottleneck is associated with *HCOO (E a = 0.85 eV) and *HCOOH (E a = 0.90 eV) hydrogenation reactions, and the corresponding barriers are much lower than that on ZnCu(211) (E a = 1.49 eV). Only *HCOO species are also observed on the ZnO/Cu(111) surface, and the total amount of occupied sites is lower than that on ZnCu(211) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) because of the bondweakening introduced by a transformation from Zn to ZnO (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). In addition, the identified active ZnO-Cu interface in DFT also explains the volcano trend between methanol production and ZnO coverage on Cu(111) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Such observation also agrees well with the previous studies, showing that the high methanol synthesis activity is associated with the combination of Cu and ZnO NPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30)</ref>. Accordingly, the previously observed increase in methanol production with the formation of ZnCu <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31)</ref> is likely attributed to the well dispersion of Zn sites, and therefore ZnO, on the top layer of the copper surface under reaction conditions, resulting in an increase in the active ZnO-Cu sites and eventually methanol production.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
