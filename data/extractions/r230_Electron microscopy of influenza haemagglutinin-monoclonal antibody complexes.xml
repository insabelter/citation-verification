Balb/ c mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of 8000 HA units of purified virus. Eight weeks later they received 32,000 BHA units of virus intraperitoneally and intravenously.

Antigenie variants of X-31 were obtained by mixing equal volumes of allantoie fluid-containing virus and undiluted ascitic fluid-containing monoclonal antibodies and using the mixture as inoculum. Variants obtained were cloned by limit dilution. Nucleotide sequences were determined as described under Methods. These were the only changes detected in the HAi regions of the HA genes. dTTP, 0.0004 M; human placenta RNase inhibitor (Bethesda Research Labs.) 3 units; reverse transeriptase, 5 units {Life Sciences); virus RNA, '7 pg; and either ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, or ddTTP, 0.00025 M. After 120 min at 42' products were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels containing 8% acrylamide. Reactions were primed using 32P-5'-labeled synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, 5 pmol (Pate1 et al, 1982) numbered according to the sequence of X-31 haemagglutinin cDNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Verhoeyen et a&amp; 1980)</ref>: 5-AAAGCAGGGG-14;</p><p>191-TGC-TACTGAGCT-202; 345~CGCAGCAAAG-354; 493-GCAAAAGGGG-502; 623~TCA-CCACCCG-632; '7'77-TGGACAATAG-786.

Antibody was added in increasing amounts until only a few molecules remained unbound to BHA after about 5 min equilibration. BHA-antibody complex suspensions were adsorbed to thin carbon films freshly stripped from mica, floated on a 1% w/v solution of sodium silicotungstate (pH 7.0) and then air dried. Micrographs were taken under minimum dose conditions known from analyses of periodic specimens to preserve detail below 1.5 nm; defocus was such that phase contrast was transferred in a continuous band down to about 1.0 nm <ref type="bibr">(Wrigley et al., 1983)</ref>. amination of the other antibody combinations although the position and binding angle of HC3; HC19, and HC45 are less easy to distinguish from one another than from HC31.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>These results directly demonstrate the sites of binding of four monoclonal antibodies of different specificities to the X-31 BHA. That the sites are different in detail for the different antibodies may be deduced from the observations that the angles formed between Fab regions and the BHA are constant and different for each antibody. The observation that these angles are constant irrespective of the type of complex observed, 1 + 1, 1 + 2,2 + 2, RHAantibody, etc., is allowed by the axial-rotation and flexing properties of the switch and hinge regions of the antibody molecules <ref type="bibr">(Wrigley et ab, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Differences in the sites of antibody binding on the BHA can also be observed directly even at this level of resolution (probably about 2 nm). For example HC45 clearly binds at a site away from an end of the BHA molecule whereas HC31 binds squarely on an end. This location of the HC31 antibody-binding site is supported by the observation of restricted complex formation. Only 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 BHAantibody complexes were seen (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) presumably because of the binding of a second antibody to an unoccupied equivalent region of the BHA trimer is sterically prevented by the first antibody bound.</p><p>The sites of antibody binding and the locations of amino acid substitutions in the BIIAs of antigenie variants can also be considered in relation to the thxee-dimensional structure of the BHA, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. These considerations indicate that the sites of amino acid substitution are in all four cases appropriately located to be involved directly in the antibody-binding sites. In the case of HC31 they also indicate the basis of the steric inhibition of the binding of a second antibody to the BHA. Since the three 198 residues recognized are only 15 A apart around the threefold axis of the trimer, the BHA is effectively monovalent at this site. The results therefore substantiate the positions of antigenic sites A, B, and E and in the ease of site B give an indication of the extent of this region at the distal tip of the BHA molecule. It would also be of interest to examine antibodies specific for sites C and D but we have not characterized antibodies prepared against X-31 virus which recognize amino acids in these sites.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.
