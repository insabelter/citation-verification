<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) constitute a class of allosteric switches that mediate a myriad of signaling events. It has been postulated that EPKs' active and inactive states depend on the structural architecture of their hydrophobic cores, organized around two highly conserved spines: C-spine and R-spine. How the spines orchestrate the transition of the enzyme between catalytically uncommitted and committed states remains elusive. Using relaxation dispersion nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found that the hydrophobic core of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, a prototypical and ubiquitous EPK, moves synchronously to poise the C subunit for catalysis in response to binding adenosine 5′-triphosphate. In addition to completing the C-spine, the adenine ring fuses the b structures of the N-lobe and the C-lobe. Additional residues that bridge the two spines (I150 and V104) are revealed as part of the correlated hydrophobic network; their importance was validated by mutagenesis, which led to inactivation. Because the hydrophobic architecture of the catalytic core is conserved throughout the EPK superfamily, the present study suggests a universal mechanism for dynamically driven allosteric activation of kinases mediated by coordinated signal transmission through ordered motifs in their hydrophobic cores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Protein phosphorylation is the most common signaling mechanism in cell biology, regulating growth, differentiation, and metabolism. Aberrant phosphorylation causes many lethal pathologies, making kinases prime targets for drug therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a benchmark for the entire eukaryotic protein kinase (EPK) superfamily. The bilobal core of the catalytic subunit (PKA-C), conserved among all Ser/Thr-and Tyr-specific kinases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, consists of a small N-lobe and a large C-lobe that harbors most of the catalytic residues as well as the substrate docking surface; adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) binds in the cleft between the two lobes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. The spatial architecture of the kinase core is also highly conserved and consists of two hydrophobic spines (regulatory R-spine and catalytic C-spine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, which serve as noncovalent links between the N-lobe and the C-lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The structural assembly of the R-spine is a hallmark for activated kinases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Formation of the R-spine is highly regulated and typically requires phosphorylation of the activation loop (Thr 197 in PKA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, whereas the C-spine is transiently assembled by ATP binding, which is an absolute requirement for orienting the nucleotide toward the substrate for catalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Once the spines are assembled, the enzyme binds substrates cooperatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref> and transfers the g-phosphate of ATP to Ser/Thr acceptors. The functional relevance of the spines has been validated by the discovery of oncogenic mutations, such as the T334I mutation found in chronic myeloid leukemia that stabilizes the R-spine of the c-Abl kinase, rendering it constitutively active and resistant to imatinib <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The constitutively activating L485F and L505F mu-tations found in BRAF <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> further support an active role for the hydrophobic spine architecture in kinase activation and regulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Here, we investigated the role of conformational dynamics in the hydrophobic core of PKA-C using methyl-TROSY (transverse-relaxation optimized spectroscopy) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and site-directed mutagenesis. Methyl groups are ideal probes for monitoring the conformational dynamics of hydrophobic cores because they densely populate the interior of folded proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. A total of 122 methyl groups [~98% of the methyl groups from isoleucine, leucine, and valine (ILV) residues] were assigned, enabling us to comprehensively map the enzyme's hydrophobic core in the apo, binary (nucleotide-bound), and ternary (substrate or pseudosubstrate) forms (figs. S1 to S3). As a substrate, we chose a peptide encompassing the PKA-C recognition sequence of phospholamban (PLN 1-19 ), a central regulator of heart muscle contractility <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. As a pseudosubstrate, we used a peptide corresponding to the inhibitory sequence of the endogenous protein kinase inhibitor (PKI 5-24 ). Upon nucleotide binding, the chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) follow linear trajectories along the coordinates of the open to closed states (figs. S4 and S5). When mapped onto the three-dimensional (3D) structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), we observe several spatially contiguous paths of residues crossing the inner core of the enzyme. Although the CSPs of the amide groups reported on the effects of ligand binding on the catalytic loop and the Mg-positioning loop (Mg loop), they were essentially silent for residues in the hydrophobic core (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S6</ref>). In contrast, methyl groups are sensitive reporters of changes occurring throughout the entire enzyme, especially across the hydrophobic core (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). By fusing the b sheet of the N-lobe with b7-b8 of the C-lobe, nucleotide binding exerts global effects that not only radiate to adjacent residues, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> (for example, L173 in b7, V57 in b2, and V104 in the aC-b4 loop), but also extend to distal sites in the hydrophobic core, including L172 and I174 in b7, L180 and L182 in b8, L95 in aC, I150 in aE, and L167 in the catalytic loop, as well as the aH and aI helices, the substrate-binding cleft, and the hub for the regulatory subunit recognition (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Substrate binding (PLN 1-19 ) shifts the enzyme's conformational equilibrium toward a closed state, which is fully reached when the pseudosubstrate inhibitor (PKI 5-24 ) is bound (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</p><p>When analyzed using statistical methods (Materials and Methods), the CSPs display a correlated behavior along the open-to-closed path (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). Fifty-eight methyl resonances interspersed throughout the enzyme's structure display correlated linear trajectories, indicating a concerted conformational exchange between the different states (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>, figs. S4 and S5, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The correlation map indicates the presence of several clusters of residues in physical contact throughout the kinase core; however, other clusters that are apparently isolated show the same correlated conformational equilibrium. However, when both the CSPs from amide and methyl probes are combined (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S6</ref>), it is apparent that the conformational changes involve the enzyme globally as predicted by the molecular dynamics simulations and community map analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</p><p>To determine the contribution of the conformational entropy to ligand binding, we calculated the methyl group order parameters (S<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> ) from 2 H spin relaxation times (T 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. The average S 2 (〈S 2 〉) systematically increases going from the apo to the intermediate and closed states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>, and tables S2 to S5), suggesting that the enzyme's conformational dynamics in the fast time scale (picosecond to nanosecond) plays a significant role in both nucleotide and pseudosubstrate recognition. Nucleotide binding makes the hydrophobic core of the enzyme more densely packed, with a concomitant increase of the local degree of ordering for the methyl-group bearing side chains. The C-spine and neighboring sidechain residues become less mobile when the adenine ring intercalates between A70 and V57 in the N-lobe and L173 in the C-lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), and this locks the core into a committed conformation that is poised for catalysis. The trend and magnitude of the methyl group 〈S2〉 do not correlate with the total entropy of binding, as seen for other systems (fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. This is not surprising because the backbone amide groups show a net increase in the conformational dynamics upon ATP binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and solvation-desolvation effects are not accounted for. Upon pseudosubstrate binding, both backbone amide and side-chain methyl group dynamics show similar trends, with a global reduction of the internal motions (that is, dynamically quenched state).</p><p>Slow conformational dynamics (microsecond-to-millisecond time scale) of the catalytic loops are directly linked to the catalytic cycle of PKA-C <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. A dynamic knockout mutation (that is, Y204A, far from the active site) shifts the motional regime of the catalytic loops outside the microsecond-to-millisecond time scale, reducing the enzyme's catalytic efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. To assess the contribution of the hydrophobic core's slow time scale motions to the catalytic process, we analyzed the structural fluctuations of the methyl-bearing side chains using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. CPMG relaxation dispersion curves enable one to determine the exchange contribution to the transverse relaxation (R ex ) and quantify both the kinetics (k ex ) and thermodynamics (that is, populations, p A and p B ) of the conformational equilibria (tables S6 to S10 and figs. S9 and S10). The apo enzyme shows significant R ex values for several residues interspersed throughout the hydrophobic core, the C-spine (V57 and L172), the R-spine (L95), the R-spine shell (V104), and additional residues neighboring and bridging the spines (L167, I180, and I150) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Although it is possible to fit dispersion curves of isolated clusters of residues, they exchange with different rate constants, suggesting that motions in the core of the apo enzyme are essentially asynchronous. Although the nucleotide binding attenuates the magnitude of the R ex values throughout the entire enzyme, significant conformational dynamics are present for residues at the interface between the two lobes. The shapes of the CPMG dispersion curves indicate that the motions become faster and (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>) most of the residues can be clustered into a unique group with a global exchange rate constant k ex = 2500 ± 300 s -1 , indicating that the enzyme's motions in the nucleotide-bound state are faster and synchronous. The residues include the C-spine (L172, L173, and I174), the R-spine (L95), and neighboring hydrophobic residues extending toward the aC helix (V104, V182, I150, I180, L162, L103, and I94) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>). Upon PLN 1-19 binding, the conformational dynamics remain persistent for these residues and become prominent for other residues away from the substrate-binding site (table S11 and fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). Residues in the C-spine and R-spine, the hydrophobic shell, and those bridging the spines moving synchronously in the nucleotide-bound state retain significant motions (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>). Significant R ex values were also observed for residues in and neighboring the C-spine (L227 and L49), the aC helix (L89), and the activation loop (V191), and throughout the two lobes. These motions exemplify the dynamically committed state of the enzyme in the presence of both nucleotide and substrate. In contrast, PKI 5-24 binding quenches most of the conformational exchange in the microsecond-to-millisecond time scale in agreement with amide measurements (fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. To verify the importance of these motions in the allosteric network, we individually mutated two residues, V104 and I150, which display significant R ex values. These residues are highly conserved throughout the EPK family <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and form a bridge between the two spines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). Community map analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories predicted that these residues are essential to the integrity of the hydrophobic core and actively participate in the dynamically driven allosteric communication (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Upon mutating these positions (V104G and I150A), the kinase does not undergo autophosphorylation at Thr 197 and S338 (figs. S13 and S14) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, confirming that the enzyme is completely inactive. Coexpressing the mutants with PDK1, a kinase that phosphorylates Thr 197 , PKA-C adopts an active conformation of the activation loop, where the R-spine is assembled and the aC helix is positioned for catalysis. Remarkably, this is not sufficient to activate the kinase. Because the mutated kinases retain the overall fold, these results suggest that I150 and V104 in the inner hydrophobic core of the kinases must contribute to the intramolecular allosteric signaling for substrate recognition and catalysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The participation of protein hydrophobic cores in the transmission of intermolecular and intramolecular allosteric signaling was hypothesized decades ago based on free-energy considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, and theoretical studies have hypothesized that correlated internal dynamics of hydrophobic cores may be required for biological function <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. In support of this, several proteins have been found to adopt loose packing of the inner cores, yet can still carry out biological functions with high specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. This is reminiscent of the 3D conservation map of PKA-C with a firmly packed core (4) and site for phosphoryl transfer buried in the center. However, our NMR analysis reveals an unprecedented map of the dynamic network of communication within the hydrophobic core of PKA-C that orchestrates signal transmission between distal sites and encapsulates the active site. The apo enzyme with a dismantled C-spine is malleable and relatively accessible to water, displaying uncorrelated motions that are uncommitted for catalysis. On the other hand, the nucleotide-bound state, with the C-spine assembled, features synchronous motions, where the fluidity of the well-packed side chains is due to an extended network of correlated motions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. We speculate that both the structure and dynamics of the core and residues surrounding the active site may have coevolved to optimize the intramolecular allosteric communication (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</p><p>Computer simulations provide us with an unprecedented computational microscope and generate new mechanistic concepts whereas crystallography provides us with static snapshots of the various conformational states that reflect the catalytic cycle. We used these tools to create a community map for PKA-C, which allows us to see how elements of secondary structure are woven together in new ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Using methyl relaxation dispersion NMR experiments, we can now experimentally capture the correlated internal dynamics of the hydrophobic core. The b structure of the kinase core, which embraces and surrounds the active-site cleft, provides a framework to think about how the adenine ring engages and commits the entire molecule to catalysis. The five-stranded b sheet in the N-lobe has been described extensively. It moves as a rigid body as the cleft opens and closes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. In the apo conformation, it is not closely engaged with the C-lobe, as confirmed by earlier NMR studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. However, when ATP binds, the adenine ring bridges the b sheet of the N-lobe with the small b7-b8 sheets in the C-lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). The b structure of the C-lobe received less attention, but is equally important for function. The b7 and b8 strands are directly linked to the catalytic loop and the Mg loop, respectively. The catalytic loop is anchored to the aF helix through Leu 167 , and this is one of the correlated residues that is quite prominent. In the assembled and active kinase, the catalytic loop is preceded by b6, whereas the Mg loop is followed by b9. The shell residues (Val 104 , Met 11 , and Met 120 ) that bridge the R-spine and C-spine in the N-lobe have been described earlier, but there are two other residues (Val 104 and Ile 150 ) that scored high on the local spatial pattern (LSP) alignment that was used to identify the spines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. At the time, however, their functional significance was not appreciated. Both of these residues are highly correlated in the methyl-TROSY NMR analysis and both serve as additional bridging residues that link the R-spine and C-spine (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>).</p><p>One additional element that was not fully appreciated in the initial analyses of the kinase structure is the aC-b4 loop, which is a classic b turn and also moves as a rigid body (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). The tip of this loop is the only piece of the N-lobe that remains anchored to the C-lobe in the open conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Val 104 and Leu 103 are part of this loop, and these residues are an important part of the correlated network of residues that  ) is anchored to the adenine ring of ATP through V57 (b2) and A70 (b3). In the C-lobe, b7 and b8 are anchored to the adenine ring through L173 (b7). The catalytic loop that spans b6 and b7 is anchored to the F helix by L167; the Mg loop (red) bridges b8 and b9. (B) Another conserved structural element in the N-lobe is the aC-b4 loop that is characterized by a stable b turn. This loop also contains many key residues with highly correlated chemical shift changes (black spheres).</p><p>engage one another following the binding of ATP. From earlier work, we know that Asn 99 , when replaced with cysteine and modified by fluorescein, is a sensor of ATP binding, and myristylation of the N terminus and the dynamic feature of this residue were also detected computationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</p><p>With methyl-TROSY relaxation dispersion experiments, we now have sensors for the entire b network and beyond. What is also striking about this network is that most of it is firmly in place and always anchored to the hydrophobic core even when the R-spine is not assembled. The one exception is b9 and the Mg loop that precedes it. This small segment shown in red in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref> is only assembled as a consequence of the formation of the R-spine. One can also appreciate how phosphorylation of the activation loop contributes to stabilizing both the active site and the R-spine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref>). This small, highly dynamic segment encapsulates the essence of the switch mechanism that is an inherent feature of every protein kinase. Here, we show that once the R-spine is assembled, the molecule is poised to be committed to catalysis in a highly correlated way in response to ATP binding.</p><p>Because the hydrophobic core of PKA-C is highly conserved across the kinome (5), it emerges as a critical element for kinase regulation and may constitute a novel target to modulate the allosteric functions of each kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. The drug imatinib, for instance, breaks the R-spine and inactivates both Src and Abl kinases (9), whereas other drugs, such as PLX4720, deform the conformation of the R-spine in BRAF and activate its noncatalytic function (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S15</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Similar strategies aimed at nonconserved allosteric pockets in kinases can be exploited to target the dynamic assembly of the spines with higher selectivity among the different kinases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample preparation</head><p>All reagents used were of analytical grade or better. Synthesis and purification of PLN 1-19 and PKI 5-24 have been previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. Details on the expression and purification procedures for PKA-C have been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>. For the samples used in the NMR relaxation experiments, the murine Ca subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-C) cDNA was cloned into a pRSETb vector. The kinase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells in M9 medium with 15 NH 4 Cl as the only source of nitrogen and 100% 2 H-glucose. The M9 salts were solubilized into 80% 2 H 2 O. For selective 13 CHD 2 labeling, the M9 medium was supplemented with 2-ketobutyric acid-4- PKA-C purification was carried out by affinity chromatography using recombinant RIIa subunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>. The RIIa(R213K) was cloned into a pRSETb vector and expressed in 4 liters of LB media. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG and carried out for 5 hours at 24°C before harvesting the cells. Cell pellets of the catalytic subunit and Rlla(R213K) were combined and lysed in 30 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (Mops), 200 mM ATP, 15 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.0). After removing cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Ni +2 nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Thermo Scientific, 1 ml of resin per liter of culture) at 4°C for approximately 3 hours. The resin was then washed with 30 mM Mops, 25 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.0) and eluted with 30 mM Mops, 25 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM 2mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM cAMP (pH 8.0). The fractions containing PKA-C were collected and dialyzed overnight in 20 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 25 mM KCl, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.5). The three isoforms of PKA-C (corresponding to the three different phosphorylation states with identical catalytic parameters) were separated by HiTrap SP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) chromatography, using a linear gradient from buffer A [20 mM KH 2 PO 4 (pH 6.5)] to 30% buffer B [20 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 1.0 M KCl (pH 6.5)] with a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Isoform II with pThr 197 , pSer 338 , and pSer 10 was used for all NMR experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NMR experimental conditions</head><p>All NMR samples were prepared in a buffer solution containing 20 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 90 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mM NaN 3 (pH 6.5) at 27°C. The concentration of the methyl-labeled PKA-C sample was 400 mM in a 250-ml volume. The sample was first titrated with adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (ATPgN) (0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 1, 2, 3, and 12 mM) and then with PKI 5-24 (100, 200, 300, and 400 mM). The titration experiments were monitored by 1 H- 13 C-heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence experiments. Note that we used a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog, ATPgC (Sigma-Aldrich), for our relaxation measurements, because ATPgN (Roche LifeScience) undergoes slow hydrolysis in a period of several days. Residue-specific resonance assignments of PKA-C were previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of CSPs</head><p>The chemical shift trajectories were monitored using the CONCISE (COordinated ChemIcal Shifts bEhavior) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> to measure the change in structural equilibrium associated with each PKA-C complex (apo, ATPgN, ATPgN/PLN 1-19 , and ATPgN/PKI 5-24 ). Using principal components analysis (PCA), the method identifies a set of residues whose chemical shifts respond linearly to the open-to-closed conformational transition of the kinase. Each one of these residues provides a measure of the equilibrium position for all the PKA-C complexes, scoring them along the first principal component. The equilibrium position for a given PKA-C variant is given by the average of the PC scores over all linear residues. To identify the residues whose chemical shifts follow a linear pattern, a threshold of 1.0 to 3.0 for the ratio of the SDs of PC1 over PC2 was used and residues affected by CSPs below 0.05 parts per million were discarded <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. To identify the largest group of residues that responded to ligand binding in a correlated fashion, an adapted version of the chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> was applied to the PCA projection of the chemical shifts. First, the correlation matrix between all linear residues' PC1 projections was constructed and used to build a dendrogram through hierarchical clustering. After a threshold of 0.97 level of correlation coefficient was applied, a total of 58 residues formed the subset to trace the equilibrium position for each state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nuclear spin relaxation experiments</head><p>Side-chain dynamics in the fast time scale (picosecond to nanosecond) were determined by measuring 2 H spin relaxation rates of the 13 CHD 2 isotopomers (40) using an 850-MHz spectrometer equipped with a Bruker AVANCE III console. For 13 CHD 2 methyllabeled PKA-C, we used a 250 mM sample for the apo form, a 230 mM sample for the binary form (saturated with 12 mM ATPgC), and a 200 mM sample for the closed form (saturated with 12 mM ATPgN and 400 mM PKI 5-24 ) in a 300-ml volume. All the samples were analyzed by dynamic light scattering to confirm sample homogeneity and determine the global rotational correlation time (t c ). All spectra were collected in an interleaved manner with relaxation delays of 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 4.0, and 4.8 ms for the apo enzyme; 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 ms for the nucleotide-bound PKA-C; and 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8, and 3.2 ms for the ternary complex. The intensities were fit to a single exponential using nonlinear fit, and the order parameter was extracted from the relaxation rate using the following relationship (40)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R D þ ð Þ ≈ R D þ D Z þ D Z D þ ð Þ ≈ 1 80 ð2pQCCÞ 2 S 2 t c</formula><p>where QCC = e 2 qQ/h is the quadrupolar coupling constant (167 ± 1 kHz) and S 2 is the order parameter. The order parameters were calculated directly using transverse deuterium relaxation rates and the global rotational correlation time based on the dynamic light scattering data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methyl relaxation dispersion experiments</head><p>Single-quantum 13 C CPMG <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> experiments were carried out on 700and 850-MHz spectrometers equipped with Bruker AVANCE and AVANCE III consoles, respectively. All the spectra were collected in an interleaved manner with CPMG field strengths of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, and 1000 Hz. Replicate experiments were performed at field strengths of 50, 300, and 1000 Hz with a constant time delay of 40 ms. Each 2D spectrum was recorded with 2048 × 160 complex points and 48 transients with a recycle delay of 2.0 s. All data were processed using NMRPipe <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, and peak intensities were picked using Sparky <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. The peak intensities were converted to transverse decay rates, R 2 eff , as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. The software GUARDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> was used to fit the relaxation data to the Carver-Richards equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, which describes the dependence of the relaxation contribution of chemical exchange, R ex , to transverse relaxation.

The fitting was performed by minimizing the function c 2 as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. The group fit of selected residues was performed if the c 2 Group /c 2 Local was less than 2.0 ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>). An estimate of the R ex can also be approximated by measuring the R 2 for a high and low t cp value. The approximate R ex was found with the same CPMG setup but with two values (with t cp values of 1 and 20 ms). The approximate R ex for the ATPgN/PLN 1-19 bound form of PKA-C was estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R ex ≈ 1 T ln Iðt cp ¼ 1 msÞ Iðt cp ¼ 20 msÞ</formula><p>where I is the intensity of the residue with the corresponding spin-echo period and T is the constant time period (40 ms).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Western blot analysis</head><p>QuikChange I and II site-directed mutagenesis kits (Agilent Technologies) were used to introduce mutations. Wild-type and mutants of PKA-C were tested for their autophosphorylation ability using the Western blot-based assay as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Briefly, recombinant forms of murine PKA-C were transformed in BL21(DE3) cells and grown in 5-ml batch cultures at 37°C until an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.6 was reached. At this time, protein overexpression was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and allowed to grow overnight. Induced cultures were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. Lysates were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and tested for phosphorylation using site-specific antibodies. trans-Phosphorylation at the activation loop was probed by pThr 197 -specific polyclonal antibody from Invitrogen. cis-Phosphorylation at the C-tail was probed by pSer 338 antibodies (BD Biosciences), and expression levels of the recombinant PKA-C were probed by monoclonal antibodies from BD Biosciences.</p></div>

Initially, a CS-BLAST (49) search against the SWISS-PROT database was performed to obtain at least 50 unique hits. The list of collected homologs was subsequently filtered by coverage (minimum of 80%) and sequence identity (between 60 and 95%). The remaining homologs were filtered again using Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance algorithm with 90% sequence identity clustering threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. The decision on whether to proceed with the search for homologs or abort and move to the next step was based on the number of sequences after filtration. For PKA-C, 301 unique homologs were collected from SWISS-PROT for this calculation. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the homologs was constructed using MAFFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>. The MSA was used to build a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>, as implemented in the Rate4Site (53) program. Position-specific conservation scores were computed using the Bayesian algorithm and JTT evolutionary substitution model and were mapped to a single-digit scale from 0 to 9 and plotted as colors onto the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure using PyMOL (Schrodinger Inc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic light scattering</head><p>The homogeneity of the PKA-C samples prepared for NMR relaxation experiments was analyzed with a Malvern Zetasizer mV system. The sample (100 ml) was placed in a polystyrene microcuvette and equilibrated for 5 min at 25°C. All of the measurements were performed at 25°C after automatic optical adjustment. Six runs were carried out, with each run consisting of an average of 11 measurements. The Z-average diameter, reporting on the hydrodynamic radius of the protein, was determined from a cumulative analysis of the measured intensity autocorrelation function using the Zetasizer software Version 6.34. Assuming isotropic molecular tumbling, using the Z-average diameter, the rotation correlation time (t c ) was calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation at 27°C where all NMR experiments were performed. </p></div>
