<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to effectively solve the related problems in the process of public management, this research proposes an improved algorithm technology based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and classification algorithm. With the help of lever management, this paper further solves and overcomes the problem of DEA algorithm itself and the defect of "relative effectiveness." At the same time, in order to avoid the impact on the input and output indicators, with the help of principal component analysis, taking the performance evaluation of public management departments as the research direction, this paper makes an empirical analysis on the performance evaluation of public management departments. *e evaluation results of the index system show that the correlation coefficient between the efficiency value of the initial index system and the efficiency value of optimization 2 is 0.977759, and the correlation coefficient is less than 0.7. *e evaluation results are more reasonable than those before the improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, with the continuous development of the market economy, the social governance structure has been continuously improved, and the pace of social governance has been gradually accelerated. As an important part of the process of social governance, the importance of public management is becoming more and more obvious. *e socalled public management is the scientific management of public affairs, which includes the management of the government, administrative management, urban management, and other aspects. With the continuous deepening and development of public management in China, some major contradictions and problems begin to appear <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Such problems as insufficient practical operation means, insufficient governance ability, poor organizational personnel quality, and public management personnel training have seriously affected the improvement of the quality of public management <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. *is study is based on these issues, through the integration of Improved DEA algorithm to further improve the public management evaluation system.</p><p>On the basis of summarizing the above, foreign scholars elaborated the interaction between the transformation of government functions and the implementation of cultural policies. Xue put forward that only by adopting the overall governance mode, crossing over the administrative settings of each department, and realizing "horizontal" cross departmental cooperation can cultural services be truly implemented; otherwise, it will only be "a piece of empty talk" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>; Zhao believes that the characteristic of cultural output is that with the growth of the national economy, the wage rate of the government's cultural department develops with other departments. However, due to the labor-intensive output, it is difficult for the productivity to keep pace with the wage growth rate, resulting in an increase in the cost of cultural input, which eventually leads to a doubling of public cultural expenditure <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>; Chen proposed that through the joint investment of the government and local cultural institutions, public cultural services can achieve twice the result with half the effort, and cause the domino effect, bringing more investment to cultural undertakings; joint investment requires both sides to express their own views and reach unity through consultation based on the principle</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>of mutual cooperation and communication. Such a model is conducive to the diversity and innovation of public cultural development <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>; Ma European cultural identity, which involves ethnic and regional identity in a broader sense, is a model of self-understanding through which individuals, groups, and societies define themselves and their relationships with others. *is changing relationship, in turn, will affect the change of self-understanding, that is, the difference in government system and environment will lead to the change of cultural identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In general, the lack of specialized research on the state of foreign service culture also means that research on the development of China's cultural service needs to be improved renewed in thought and action.</p><p>In China, DEA has been applied in many fields. National cotton mills, industryers, and smelters use the DEA method to evaluate the performance of companies and deliver the results to the actual department, which has been praised by stakeholders affected. *e National Academic Association approached the DEA to evaluate its effectiveness, which was favored by many. *e DEA is a great way to learn about the human resources and potential of coal production in China. Some scholars use the DEA method to determine that "finance is the most important factor affecting the performance of China's high-tech industry and human technology" <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. He hoped that China's high-tech industry will continue to benefit from the application of science and technology of human resources in the field of performance measurement, innovation baking, and financial management. Some researchers have used the best data shell model to measure the performance of listed companies in the coal industry and estimate the market share and product shortages in the decision-making. *ey believe that the production efficiency of most listed coal enterprises is acceptable, but there are great individual differences. Many enterprises still have great room for improvement and put forward suggestions to the administrative departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p></div>

Construction of Index System. We check the impact of indicators on museum performance evaluation according to the commonality of specific indicators. *e greater the degree of commonality, the greater the degree of common dependence of the index on the common factor, that is, it is relatively effective to use this common factor to explain the index. Correlation analysis is required before analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Generally, the higher the correlation coefficient, the closer the relationship between the two index items. Generally speaking, above 0.7 can be understood as relatively high. By taking the data of 31 provinces in China from 2018 to 2021 as the sample data (124 sample data), after standardized processing, Spss21.0 was run to calculate the common factor, and the following results (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1 to 4</ref>) were obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. *e analysis results of gravel diagram are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Sample data passed KMO test. *e higher the KMO value, the greater the significance of the changes and the greater the need for analysis. *e chart shows that the KMO value is 0.879, indicating that the index is appropriate for analysis. In general, it is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. *ree indicators have been omitted due to differences in three indicators returned this year: cultural monuments, important artifacts, and the number of patents are less than 0.3. Go back to another measurement to get a performance measurement in time. Based on collaborations and releases, 10 museum performance measures were performed as shown in Table 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</p><p>It is scientific and innovative to use factor analysis to select the evaluation indicators of museums.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Optimization of Input and Output Indexes</head><p>Based on DEA Method. DEA method is based on known data sets, so the evaluation results directly depend on the selection of input and output indicators. In the chapter, the index system is constructed theoretically and scientifically, but the principle of the method itself on the data is not fully considered. *erefore, the index system should be analyzed from the perspective before performance evaluation. From the perspective of DEA application, the selection of DEA indicators should follow the following basic principles:</p><p>Objective measurement. When selecting a measuring device, whether the measurement objective can be achieved, i.e., the choice of the measuring device, the output measurement should be consistent with the functional and objective measurement. Objective assessment requires a variety of materials and tools to describe the whole process <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of events.</head><p>Determine the number of units of measurement. Numerous input and output parameters can increase the number of positives, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the DEA method. Measurements should be kept as simple as possible at the target location. Some researchers believe that all input and output measures should not exceed 1/3 of the scoring sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Relevance. Considering the relationship between input indicators and output indicators, the inputs and outputs of DMU are often not isolated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. When there is a strong linear correlation between an input indicator and other input indicators, it can be considered that the information of the indicator has been included by other indicators to a large extent, so it can be considered to exclude the input indicator. *e same is true for output indicators. *is will also lead to more DEA-effective units and affect the evaluation results.</p><p>Diversity. Since the core work of the method is "evaluation," there are generally different aspects under a large evaluation objective. *e diversity of input and output indicator systems should be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. *en, on the premise of determining the evaluation objective, multiple input and output indicator systems should be designed, such as from multiple indicators to fewer indicators, to observe which indicators have the greatest impact on the effectiveness value or design similar but different index systems to reflect different aspects of the evaluation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>*e specific process is as follows: calculate the effective value of each decision-making unit through the practice index system and then calculate the effective value of each decision-making unit through the optimization index system that specifically reflects the evaluation purpose. Finally, the correlation coefficients of the two sets of effective values are calculated. If there is no significant correlation between the effective values calculated by the   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>two index systems, it can be considered that the optimization index system is not comprehensive. On the contrary, if the correlation is significant, it indicates that the optimized index system can replace the previous index system for performance evaluation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. *e steps are as follows:</p><p>Step 1: determine the practice index system and preliminarily evaluate each decision-making unit; Step 2: optimize the index system based on principles and criteria and conduct preliminary evaluation on each decisionmaking unit; Step 3: calculate the correlation of the effectiveness values of the two sets of index systems obtained by the method and use the above criteria to judge the comprehensiveness and equivalence of the two sets of index systems so as to form a relatively accurate index system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Principle of Determining Index Weight</head><p>(1) ;e principle of system optimization. In the evaluation index system, each index has its role and contribution to the system and has its importance to the system. *erefore, the determination of index weight should not only start from a certain index but should consider comprehensively, deal with the relationship between the evaluation indexes, and reasonably allocate their weights. We should follow the principle of system optimization and take the overall optimization as the starting point and goal. Under the guidance of this principle, analyze and compare each evaluation index in the evaluation index system, weigh their respective roles and effects on the whole, and then judge their relative importance. Determine their respective weights, that is, they cannot be evenly distributed, nor can they unilaterally emphasize the optimization of a certain index or a single index while ignoring the development of other aspects. In practice, each indicator should play its due role.</p><p>(2) ;e principle of combining the subjective intention of the evaluator with the objective situation. *e weight of the evaluation index reflects the guiding intention and values of the evaluator and the organization. When they feel that a certain indicator is very important and need to highlight its role, they must use a larger weight for each indicator. However, the actual situation is often not completely consistent with people's subjective will. For example, when determining the weight, we should consider the following issues: historical indicators and realistic indicators, recognized by the society and the particularity of the enterprise, and balance between the same industry and the same type of work. *erefore, we must consider the reality at the same time and combine the guiding intention with the reality. As mentioned earlier, economic and social benefits should be considered simultaneously in evaluating the performance of public cultural services.</p><p>(3) ;e principle of combining democracy with centralism. Weight is people's understanding of the importance of evaluation indicators, is the quantification of qualitative judgment, and is often affected by personal subjective factors. Different people have their own views on the same thing, and they are often different, in which there are reasonable elements. Of course, there are also prejudices caused by personal values, abilities, and attitudes. *is requires the implementation of the principle of group decision-making, integrating the opinions of relevant personnel to complement each other and form a unified plan. *is process has the following advantages: considering problems comprehensively, making the weight distribution more reasonable, and preventing individuals from understanding and dealing with problems unilaterally. It objectively coordinates the contradictions of different opinions among the evaluation parties. *e scheme determined through discussion, consultation, and investigation of various specific situations is very persuasive and eliminates many unnecessary disputes in advance. *is is a mode of participating in management. During the discussion of the scheme, all parties put forward their own opinions and have further experience and understanding of the evaluation objectives and system objectives. In daily work, they can better work according to the original objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>*e standard values of qualitative indicators are different from those of quantitative indicators, which are easy to collect. *ey are generally obtained through the following methods:</p><p>(1) Expert experience. Expert experience refers to the experience of experts in judging the performance of the public resource supply based on their own experience, combining the political and economic development situation at that time, as well as the economic and social benefits generated by similar projects, units, or departments using similar funds in previous years, and combining certain domestic and foreign experience.</p><p>*e questionnaire test establishes qualitative standards through public judgment for some indicators related to public satisfaction and expenditure targets to be achieved.</p><p>(2) Horizontal comparison. Make a comprehensive comparison of the results achieved by the supply performance of similar public goods at home and abroad. Of course, with the continuous progress of science and technology in human society, new technologies and methods will continue to emerge, and some qualitative indicators that are difficult to quantify will be gradually quantified or accurately grasped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Performance Evaluation Method System of Public</head><p>Cultural Services. When engaging in any work, we must understand the methods. As the resource input of public cultural services depends on the government and financial input, the output mainly depends on the public's awareness and satisfaction with culture. As a result, the competition mechanism in the whole field is not strong, and public cultural services are difficult to quantify. In particular, the public cultural services studied in this paper are 6</p><p>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>difficult to measure by market means. In addition, the authenticity and comparability of data in the field of cultural public services and the difficulty in quantifying most of the achievements of cultural services make it difficult to measure the performance of the public sector. Despite this, people still try to apply various advanced methods to the performance evaluation of public cultural services. *e main methods are as follows:</p><p>(1) Performance evaluation table method. *e performance evaluation table method, also known as the scoring table method, should be said to be an early method. It mainly uses the relevant performance factors formulated by the government to evaluate the performance of the work (such as the number of annual visitors to the museum and the number of books lent out). Compare and score the work performance with the relevant factors one by one and then get the overall results of the work performance. According to the results, it is classified into four levels: excellent, good, qualified, and unqualified.</p><p>(2) Management by objectives. It is the most typical resultoriented performance evaluation method. At that time, the objective management method was widely used. *e evaluation object of the objective management method was mainly the work performance of employees, that is, focusing on the completion of objectives. *rough this method, employees could be promoted to work towards objectives to a certain extent.</p><p>(3) Key performance indicator method. *e theoretical basis of the process of measuring performance is based on the "February 8 principle" stated by Italian scientist Pareto. In the process of establishing the business value, it is believed that 80% of the work of each department and staff do 20% of the simple behavior, and this 20% capture will understand all. Along with these concepts, key indicators such as feedback and benefits of the organization's internal processes are identified, modeled, accounted for, evaluated, and implemented, and goals of the industry have exploded. *is way, it is possible to clearly identify the key roles of responsibility to the director of the company and to develop standards of performance for the employees in the department.</p><p>(4) Data envelopment analysis method. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is developed on the basis of the theory of "relative efficiency evaluation." Its core idea is to estimate the frontier of effective production by observing a group of values about input and output. It is applicable to the effectiveness evaluation of multiple decision-making units with the same type of multiple inputs and outputs. DEA has obvious advantages in efficiency evaluation: first, in the process of evaluation, only input indicators and output indicators need to be determined, without constructing specific production functions or models; secondly, it is suitable for complex objective evaluation with multiple inputs and outputs; then, this method does not require the dimension of the indicators. As long as a specific indicator of the decision-making unit uses the same dimension, the original data can be directly analyzed. *e above advantages of DEA method can just meet the requirements of efficiency evaluation of public cultural services. First of all, the government's human, financial, and material inputs in various branches of public cultural services are eventually transformed into various specific public goods and services. Generally, we can only determine which outputs are related to inputs. As for the transformation relationship behind it, it is difficult to quantify and measure in reality; secondly, public cultural services cover a wide range, which belongs to a typical multi-input and multi-output situation.; Moreover, it is inconvenient or impossible to measure the input and output of public cultural service supply in terms of money or some other specific dimension in many cases, and DEA can just avoid this point. *erefore, the DEA method will have a broad application prospect in evaluating the efficiency of government supply of public goods. *is paper is also based on this discussion. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Based on the improved DEA algorithm, this research puts forward the theoretical framework of public cultural service performance evaluation system. *e theoretical framework of performance evaluation system is the key to the government supply of public cultural services. *e construction of the public cultural service performance evaluation index system needs to have a clear target, be good at using scientific analysis methods, scientifically measure the validity and reliability of the index system, and design the public cultural service performance evaluation index system according to the objectives, performance dimensions, performance orientation, and other ideas of performance evaluation. C 2 R model and superefficiency model in DEA algorithm are innovatively and comprehensively applied to the performance evaluation of government supply of public cultural services. DEA method has many advantages. It determines the attribution of the index system by fitting the path coefficients of each factor in the model through objective data and automatically generates weights. It is suitable for analyzing the performance evaluation of public cultural services. On the basis of collecting a large number of statistical sample data, taking into account the large differences between different types of public cultural services, this paper makes an empirical analysis on the performance appraisal of public management departments with the help of principal component analysis and taking the performance appraisal of public management departments as the research direction. *e evaluation results of the index system show that the correlation coefficient between the efficiency value of the initial index system and the efficiency value of optimization 2 is 0.977759, and the correlation coefficient is less than 0.   </p></div>

It can be seen that this method improves the rationality and reliability. *e general performance evaluation is used to regard the categories of the total performance that are actually intrinsically related as uncorrelated individuals for analysis. *erefore, this paper uses the superefficiency model to evaluate the overall performance of public cultural services and gives the interaction between the input and output indicators of public cultural services. *e basic conclusion of the government supply performance of public cultural services in China is that the overall performance is insufficient, the regional gap is large, the structure is balanced, and the economic support is obvious.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Gravel diagram.</figDesc></figure>
