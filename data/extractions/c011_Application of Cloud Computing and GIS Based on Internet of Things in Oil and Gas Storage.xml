Oil and gas resources are the most widely used and longest used resources in the world, and people have been working on their efficient storage and transportation. As a product of modern high-tech, the oil and gas storage and transportation production information system has provided tremendous help for oil and gas storage, transportation and safety management. (e Internet of (ings and GIS technology are also new technologies that should be developed and used in various industries. In developed countries, the research on the Internet of (ings and GIS has been relatively long, and the research on oil and gas storage and transportation is relatively in-depth. As an energy source, China is in urgent need of high-efficiency technologies for oil and gas storage and transportation. (erefore, it is now managing oil and gas storage and transportation production. Research on information systems is very necessary.</p><p>In the 21st century, people have realized that energy is slowly depleting, and the awareness of the energy crisis is gradually becoming stronger. (erefore, there are many research studies on oil and gas storage and transportation and GIS technology. Al-Rojaie discussed the opinions of Qassimi Arabic speakers on the linguistic variation of their own dialects, and the socio-cultural evaluations related to their opinions. Using geographic information system (GIS) mapping software for analysis, their research shows that it is necessary to further explore the potential ideologies and social values of Arabic speakers of their own dialects and other dialects in the Arabic community <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.

It is the development result of cloud computing, distributed computing, parallel computing, practical computing, network storage technology, virtualization, load balancing, and other traditional computer technologies. Cloud computing aims to provide users with cloud architecture nodes, and integrate a large number of relatively low-cost computer entities through the Internet or LAN to form a computer system with strong computing power. Under the SOA framework, with the help of three service providers of cloud computing: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and other advanced software models, this distributed cloud computing system with super performance has reached the hands of users.</p><p>With the continuous advancement of technical means, the popularization and application of various advanced sensing technologies and equipment, the application prospects of the Internet of (ings are very broad, and more and more sensors are deployed in a wide range of production and life fields, from national security, public health, Facilitate transportation and other government public management, to smart homes, health checks, convenient payment and other daily life of the people, and are connected by the Internet and communication technology.

On the GIS system, two-dimensional geographic information data is established with north, south, east, and west as x, y. For pipeline laying simulation, three-dimensional geographic data will be established with the buried depth as z.

We randomly selected two oil and gas stations on the GIS system and let the system simulate pipeline construction. In order to test the effect of the system, we selected 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 50 km on the map, and 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 100 km on the map. Select 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 200 km on the map, and select 10 groups of oil and gas stations with a straight line distance of 400 km on the map to test the algorithm respectively. (e selected distance is divided by referring to the distance between most oil and gas stations on the map. (e test results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">1</ref>:</p><p>It can be found from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> that in the simulation of different distances, the system has the effect of reducing the laying path and optimizing the path. In the shortdistance pipeline laying of 50 km, the simulation effect of 9 out of 10 times is better. (e effect reached 90%; in the 100 km pipeline laying, the optimization effect reached 100%, and the results of 10 simulations were shorter than the original laying path. In the pipeline laying of 200 km, the optimization effect is 60%, six simulation results are shorter than the original path, two simulation results are equivalent to the original path, and two simulation results are longer than the original algorithm. In the 400 km pipeline laying simulation, the optimization effect was also 90%, and once again it was similar to the original path. (erefore, the system has a relatively good effect on path optimization, but the effect is not particularly good in the simulation of 200 km mid-distance pipeline transportation.</p><p>Friction analysis is drag reduction analysis. For oil pipelines, too much resistance will result in a great decrease in oil delivery. (ere are also many studies on friction analysis-related literature. Generally, it is believed that the relationship between oil delivery and resistance is shown in the figure : 
In Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, H represents the resistance and Q represents the maximum oil delivery. It can be found that when the pressure of the oil transfer pump is constant, the smaller the resistance, the greater the maximum oil transfer volume. Because the resistance is impossible to eliminate, at H1, the maximum oil delivery and the resistance value reach a balanced state. At this time, the resistance is also more difficult to drop, and the drop in resistance has a small impact on the oil delivery. (erefore, we hope that the simulated frictional resistance of the pipeline can be closer to H1. In actual operation, the resistance of oil pipelines is generally fixed, and we can reduce the resistance by drag reducer.</p></div>

(e test results are as follows:</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>, LoadRunner is used to simulate 50 people online at the same time, and the response time of each person in the system is recorded separately. It can be seen that the response time of 50 people is between 4 s and 5 s, which conforms to a stable time series. (e response time of the system is considered to be relatively stable, the lowest response time is 4 s, the highest is 5 s, and the difference is 1 s. In the actual situation, the average user's stay time will not exceed 5 s. If it exceeds 5 s, most users will choose to leave. It can be found that the system in this article is in line with actual usage requirements. (en analyze the performance of the system.</p><p>In order to test the maximum performance of the system, LoadRunner is used to simulate the number of people online from 1 to 100 at the same time. Each simulation is performed 10 times and the average value is the response time of the number of people online at the same time. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>, with the increase in the number of people, the response time is also at the right price, and the overall rise is stepped up. What can be found is that when the number of people at the same time reaches more than 80 people, the response time exceeds 5 s. At this time, the user experience is very bad. When the </p></div>
