<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the fast advancement in digital news, fake news has already caused grave threats to the public's actual judgment and credibility, in specific, with the wide use of social networking platforms, which provide a rich environment for the generation and dissemination of fake news. To cope with these challenges, several techniques were proposed to detect fake news, but still, there is an urgent need to propose an improved detection technique that provides a high level of detection performance in an automatic manner. Therefore, this article proposes a hybrid-improved deep learning model for automatic fake news detection. The proposed model adopts automatic data augmentation method, called Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks, to artificially synthesize new fake news samples, and then, hybridize the Convolutional Neural Network with the Recurrent Neural Networks to detect the fake news efficiently. The proposed model shows superior results against the state-of-the-art models as it provides 93.87% accuracy, 10.39% recall, 93.12% precision in detecting the fake news using Buzzfeed, FakeNewsNet and FakeNewsChallenges datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>For the time being, the proliferation of social media networking has significantly changed the way users acquire information. Recent survey conducted by Pew Research Center survey, stated that about (68%) American adults get news through social media networking at least occasionally. Fake news are intentional and verifiable spurious news stories, which might spread virally over several social media networking as the users seldom verify the source of the news while sharing any news content that sounds real and true <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ozbay and Alatas 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al. 2020)</ref>. A lot of negative impacts, such as social attack and financial loss, might be resulted from the spread of fake news. Large number of high-influence fake news has been witnessed lately, which were spread with different goals and events including Cyber-attacks, presidential election, terrorist plots and natural disasters, and severe weather. Despite the true information later disseminates, in many cases, the fast spread of fake news usually causes destructive and wasteful consequences. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates sample of the fake news spread over the social media networking.</p><p>In fact, identification of the fake news is undeniably a critical issue for the news sector, journalists, and readers as well; thus, the automated detection tools of fake news have become an urgent necessity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Umer et al. 2020)</ref>. Since manual detection of fake news is a very tedious and timeconsuming task, therefore, automatic identification of fake news has drawn huge attention in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to reduce the burdensome and time-consuming manual activities of true verifying <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lazer et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Konstantinovskiy et al. 2021)</ref>. Deep learning methods such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and its variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Neculoiu et al. 2016</ref>) have been utilized efficiently in solving different NLP problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Umer et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As one of the most emerging topics nowadays, fake news detection has caught the attention of researchers in NLP and AI fields all over the world. Thus, a massive amount of research has been conducted based on either content or context news features and proposed benchmark datasets. Despite getting significant attention in the research field, yet detection of fake news has not provided a significantly enhanced performance because of insufficient context-based news data. Building proper hand-engineered news features <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chong et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fazil and Abulaish 2018)</ref> to distinguish the falseness and trueness of such news is a technically challenging process. In contrast to the traditional feature-based technique, deep learning-based detection has the advantage in the sense that it does not need any handcrafting of features, rather it only classifies and distinguishes the optimal feature set on its own for a problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mohammed and Daham 2021)</ref>. With fulminatory advancement, fake news has already caused grave threats to the public's actual judgment and credibility, particularly, with the wide use of social networking platforms, which provide a rich environment for generation and dissemination of fake news. For instance, during the 2016 United State Presidential Election, massive amount of fake news regarding presidential candidates was generated and distributed among different social networking platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jin et al. 2016</ref>), as over one hundred fake stories were shared for pro-Trump on Facebook platform more than 30 million times, and over 41 fake stories were also shared for pro-Clinton on Facebook more than 7.6 million times <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Allcott and Gentzkow 2017)</ref>. Such a huge volume of viral fake news has not only damaged candidates' public persona but also has provided illusive voters' judgment. Therefore, it has become vital to detect fake news efficiently, especially on social media networking to block the speedy spread.</p><p>However, there are clear differences between fake news and classical fraudulent data/information. As the fake news are intentionally modified by its creators to accomplish the goal of misleading the public. For example, news about the same topic published by several creators has close similarity in most content, but malicious news content is carried out by fake news carriers in objective statements. Although the proportion of these suspicious contents is negligible, this is enough to make the news a harmful fake one. Besides, for classical malicious information, such as spam <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(You et al. 2020)</ref>, users instinctively have a prophylactic mentality, which makes them less likely to be beguiled. But for news, users often actively explore, receive, send, and share without being on sentinel about information authenticity. Also, spams are often easier to be prevented or detected due to the abundant orderly messages; so far, detection of fake news is incredibly challenging because news is a timesensitive content. The proof gathered about past news might not benefit detecting fake news plainly. These features of fake news make the detection task more challenging and complex. Moreover, a considerable volume of misleading and inconceivable information is created by the several users and shared through the social network platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marin and Arroyo 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kaushik and Gandhi 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sahoo and Gupta 2021)</ref>. It also generated a potential malicious threat to different communities and had a profound negative influence over the end-users via multiple advertisement, electronic shopping and/ or social messaging in terms of 3Vs drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>For the time being, several techniques were proposed to detect fake news, which might roughly be classified into two main categories, namely: (i) detection based on traditional </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A R T I C L E</head><p>learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hakak et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budhi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Machova et al. 2020</ref>) and (ii) detection based on deep learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Umer et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nasir et al. 2021</ref>). In the first category, features are typically extracted from news articles, and then the classifier is trained using these extracted features. On the other hand, detection based on deep learning have provided an enhanced performance in detecting fake news due to its robust abilities of learning informative representations in automatic manner. However, to train deep learning models efficiently, a large amount of labeled data is required (i.e., news should be labeled as real news or fake news). The creation of this labeled data is expensive in terms of efforts and time. Besides, accurate and precise labels might only be provided if the annotators are experts and have adequate knowledge about the news. Moreover, the news articles are characterized by their dynamic nature, which means blighting quality of existing labeled data. Also, part of these news samples might become outdated speedily and could not represent the news articles on recently emerged topics. Thus, to preserve the quality of labeled sample, the annotators should constantly label newly emerging news, which is an infeasible process. To perfectly unleash the strength of deep learning methods in detecting fake news, it is vital to overcome the challenge of labeling fake news efficiently. To do so, the main goal of this study is to improve the detection of fake news using a hybrid deep learning method. The following objectives are formulated to the achieve the main goal:</p><p>• To investigate the importance of deep learning over machine learning models in detecting fake news. • To adapt automatic data augmentation method, called Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN), to artificially synthesize new fake news samples. • To hybridize CNN with RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) to detect fake news efficiently.</p><p>• To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique by comparing it with state-of-art techniques.</p><p>In this article, the main contribution is proposing an automated and intelligent model that can classify digital news with stance labels of either fake or real news. The detection is performed based on the level of correspondence between the title and body/content assigned to titles. A hybrid deep learning model is used to extract the significant features using CNN, then these extracted features are fed into an enhanced RNN model, called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to classify these by getting the high level of features representations. Therefore, the proposed model takes the advantage of both CNN and d LSTM. In detail, CNN obtains the text features, then these features set is passed to the embedding layer to vectorize all these extracted features. After that, these vectors are fed to a one-dimensional convolutional layer that aims to extract the significant features by performing 64 filters of five different dimensions. Features with the highest importance are selected by the max-pooling layer. Then, the remaining text features are fed to the LSTM to perform sequence modeling and to discover the hidden relevance of keywords and text contents.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. "Related works" provides an analysis of related works. "Proposed model" discusses the stages of the proposed model in detail. "Results and discussion" discusses the experimental results and findings. Finally, "Conclusion" concludes the paper with possible future research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related works</head><p>News can be generally categorized into fake or real news based on different aspects such as news author or publisher, title and sub-titles, textual and visual content. Existing studies use news textual content and social context to detect fake news. For instance, in <ref type="bibr">Zhou and Zafarani (1812)</ref>, four main aspects have been presented to classify news articles as knowledge, style, propagation, and credibility. Knowledge and style exploit the news textual content, while propagation and credibility aspects exploit the social context. Since features of news content might be captured through linguistic and visual cues in the news article <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albahar 2021)</ref>. Besides, new detection method has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sultana and Palaniappan (2020)</ref> to detect deceptive spam reviews based on specific features such as number of partof-speech tags, word counts, etc. Also, a context-free grammar basis is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Khan et al. (2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wynne and Wint 2019)</ref> to detect deceptive reviews. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhang and Ghorbani (2020)</ref>, various lexical and syntactic aspects of a news article have been explored to specify the misleading content. They have investigated various types of syntactic Twitter-based PolitiFact dataset was used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the experiment results revealed that the proposed model achieved 63% classification accuracy. In addition, page-rank-like credibility method is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gupta et al. (2012)</ref> to evaluate the credibility of each twitter event. First, a classifier method extracts features of users, tweets, and events. Then, basic credibility analysis is conducted through network information of each tweet, events, and their users as well. Finally, a hybrid fake news detection model is based on hybridizing CNN with Long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed model used two dimensionality reduction methods (i.e., Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Chi-Square, which are used to diminish the dimensionality of the features' vectors before bypassing them to the classifier. FNC dataset was used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the results reveal that the proposed model improves the accuracy, F1-score by 4% and 20%, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Umer et al. 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposed model</head><p>To achieve the objectives of this study, the following methodology will be followed. As shown below in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the followed methodology consists of three main stages, namely: (i) data pre-processing, (ii) data augmentation using ACGAN, and (iii) classification using hybrid CNN and RNN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-processing</head><p>In the first stage, datasets will be collected from online resources (such as: FakeNewsNet, 1 Buzzfeed, 2 and Fak-eNewsChallenges 3 ), which are commonly used by prior studies, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shu et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ghosh and Shah 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ozbay and Alatas 2018)</ref>, to demonstrate the effectiveness of fake news models. Then these datasets will be pre-processed since they have versatility in their data formats; therefore, it is necessary to preprocess and encode them before feeding them into next stage <ref type="bibr">(Ozbay and Alatas 2018)</ref>. The preprocessing steps are as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. To stem a word, simply remove the suffix of a word to reduce it to its root. As an example, "walking", "walks", and "walked" all are stemmed to "walk". Stemming is not without its faults, however <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hasan and Alhayani 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yahya et al. 2021)</ref>. We can run into the issue of over-stemming. Over-stemming is when words with different meanings are stemmed to the same root a false positive. Then, the procedure of stop words removal is carried out, as stop words do not add essentially to the meaning of the text and can be removed without affecting the text for the designated purpose. This removal of stop words from the vocabulary caters to noise reduction as well as reduction of dimension of the feature in Python, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library comes in clutch here. A set of both English words and stop words can be downloaded and compared against the input tokens (Abu-Rumman 2021). To detect the fake news, the return tokens are only English and not the stop words. Finally, the process of breaking the raw text into small units, known as tokenization, is carried out. These tokens play a vital role in establishing the understanding of the context and for the development of the model for Natural Language Processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aldiabat et al.(2018)</ref>. The whole process of the interpretation of the meaning of the text is made easy through tokenization. Tokenization can be implemented using a variety of methods and approaches. This research has made use of the RegexpTokenizer within the NLTK library and the RegexpTokenizer will employ regular expressions to either match tokens or separators (i.e., include or exclude regex matches). Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrates sample dataset before and after pre-processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Automatic data augmentation</head><p>Whilst the second stage aims to produce a new synthetic instance generated from the original dataset, to avoid overfitting during classifier training train it efficiently, and thus the The discriminator D receives either as training instance or a synthesized instance as an input from the generator and then outputs a probability distribution P(S|X) = D(X) over possible instance sources. The discriminator maximizes the log-likelihood that it assigns to the correct source where the generator minimizes the second term. The side information can be used to augment the basic GAN framework. In one of the strategies, both the generator and discriminator are supplied with class labels for the purpose of producing class conditional samples. The quality of generated samples can be greatly enhanced by using class conditional synthesis. Every generated sample in the ACGAN has a corresponding class label, c ∼ p c in addition to the noise z. G uses both to generate images X fake = G(c, z). The discriminator provides both a probability distribution over sources and a probability distribution over the class labels, P(S|X), P(C|X) = D(X). The objective function has two parts: the log-likelihood of the correct source, L S , and the log-likelihood of the correct class, L C <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shu et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>D is trained to maximize L S + L C , while G is trained to maximize L C -L S . AC-GANs learn a representation for z that is independent of class label. This model has essential structural differences from all other models. This structural modification attributed to the standard GAN formulation produces much improved results to stabilize training. And the ACGAN model the technical contribution of this work has resulted in the form of the ACGAN model.</p><p>However, the generated dataset instances along-with the original dataset instances will be used as input for the hybrid model proposed in the next stage (i.e., the third stage).  This model incorporates the LSRM layer that processes the text features secured through convolution layer and extracts the temporal features of the input data. It is followed by maximum pooling layer, where it compresses and highlights the combination of text and temporal features. This improved CRNN model involves the principle of dealing with the problem as sequential and short. The CNN-RNN model places the pooling layer with prominent features behind the LSRM layer, highlighting the text features as well as the temporal features.</p></div>

This dataset holds the core features as summarized in Table <ref type="table">2:</ref> As illustrated below in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, FakeNewsNet dataset contains two main comprehensive datasets (i.e., PoliticalFact and GossipCop) with several categories including news content (linguistics and visual), social context (user, post, response and network), and spatiotemporal information (spatial and temporal).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D A R T I C L E</head><p>Besides, the FakeNewsChallenges which is a benchmark dataset consists of more than 75 k labeled instances and 2587 article contents, which linked with 300 titles approximately, and for every claim, there are number of news articles ranging from 5 to 20 articles. The details of the labels for each instance are shown below in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.</p><p>Where the agree label indicates that there is a relation between headline and article content (i.e., classified as real news), disagree: There indicates that there is no relation between headline and article content (i.e., classified as fake news). Discuss indicates that there is a little bit of match between headline and article content (i.e., classified as fake news). Unrelated indicates that the topic discussed in the headline is totally irrelevant with content (i.e., classified as fake news).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental results</head><p>In the final set of experiments, the proposed CNNRNNbased detection model is trained on 80 k samples and tested on 20 k headlines and digital articles. The training task takes 5 h to run 4000 epochs on all training samples and to show the detections results. After that, the results are compared with state-of-the-arts models including CNNLSTM, Fak-eDetector, CNN-based, and RNN-based fake news detection models. By analyzing all the results, as noticed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, the proposed detection model provides high accuracy ranging from 90.50 to 97.35% with the number of epochs ranging from 1000 to 4000 epochs. Further, the recall (false detection) rate has reduced from 17.19 to 3.219% while the number of epochs increases from 1000 to 4000 epochs. Whilst the recall percentage has wobbly results ranging from 92.09 to 94.16% with 1000-4000 epochs. These results prove that as the number of epochs increases, the greater number of times, the weight is changed in the neural networks and the curve goes from underfitting to optimal to overfitting curve; thus, performance is improved significantly.</p><p>As aforementioned, the proposed model has been compared with the other-state-of-the-art models including CNNbased <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Salam et al. 2022)</ref>, RNN-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Viana 2018)</ref>, Fak-eDetector <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kula et al. 2020)</ref>, and CNNLSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Umer et al. 2020)</ref> to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results revealed that the proposed model is more effective for detecting fake news and it has impressive results (in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall) compared to the other-state-of-the-art models, as shown below in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>From the above table, it noticeable that the proposed CNNRNN model archives the highest detection accuracy with 93.87%, followed by CNNLSTM, FakeDetector, CNNbased, and RNN-based models with 91.77%, 86.03%, 83% and 81.07%, respectively. On the other hand, in terms of recall, CNNRNN model archives the lowest recall with 10.39%, followed by CNNLSTM, FakeDetector, CNNbased, and RNN-based models with 12.26%, 13.96%, 15.42%% and 19.33%, respectively. Lastly, in terms of precision, still the proposed CNNRNN model outperforms the other-state-of-the-art models as it achieves 93.12% precision, followed by CNNLSTM, FakeDetector, CNN-based, and RNN-based models with 91%, 90.09%, 90.01% and 87.12%, respectively.</p><p>Taking into consideration the accuracy, precision and recall of the experiment results, the proposed CNNRNN model exhibits the most precise and the best performance in detection results when compared with other four  </p></div>

In the proposed model, CNN model is used to extract textural features in the sentence-level for each textual news, and a RNN model is mainly used to learn the potential patterns and their mutual correlation (i.e., real, or fake). This intelligent-automatic approach might help reduce the spread of fake news, which is a serious problem and often has adverse effects on the society. Only true and fake digital news is studied in this article. Initially, the features of fake news are often similar to the real news since the news editors post fake news and try to do the best to ensure that the readers consider the news content/ body is real. Such reason demonstrates why the prior work in detecting fake news did not always provide overwhelming results. In this article, the experiments are conducted on computer device with suitable hardware specifications as listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. These hardware specifications enable the proposed model to process these large datasets efficiently. In addition, Keras library in Python is used, which is considered one of the most powerful libraries used to develop and evaluate deep learning models.</p><p>The ongoing and prior works related to automatic fake news detection comprise different hackathons and electronic competitions to provide a commercially available and efficient model, which enclose a state-of-the-art detection, as extensions in web browsers. The existing tool has the ability to mark digital news as true or fake, but does not provide a rating or label beforehand, to describe the credibility that enucleate the real main issue. With enough improvements and inclusion of more input features in the automatic detection model, a future tool can be developed to allow users to find a score for digital articles, as well as suitable and accurate label for digital articled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This article proposes an automatic fake news detection model based on hybrid deep learning models. The proposed model mainly deals with the headline and the content of the news irrespective of the state-of-the-art models that only consider the individual news' sentences or specific phrases. The proposed hybrid model incorporates automatic data   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Sample of fake news</figDesc><graphic coords="2,84.52,57.76,426.24,255.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Despite CNN-based detection models are characterized by its high performance in exploiting features derived from spatial data (i.e., digital images), it is improper to dealing with sequential data (i.e., textual data). In contrast, RNN-based detection models have robust capabilities in modeling sequential data. Inspired by their (1) L S = E[log P(S = real|Xreal)]+E[ log P(S = f ake|Xfake)], (2) L C = E[log P(C = c|Xreal)]+E[ log P(C = c|Xfake)].</figDesc></figure>

And then, hybridize Convolutional Neural Network with Recurrent Neural Networks to detect fake news efficiently. Firstly, data pre-processing performs title extraction, stemming, stop word removal, and tokenization to ensure that the datasets are ready to be fed into the deep learning models. Then, Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks is used to enrich the content of these datasets and ensure avoiding data loss and overfitting during classifier training. Finally, the dataset resulting from the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks is used to train the hybrid classifier (Convolutional Neural Network with Recurrent Neural Networks) and the testing dataset is used to evaluate the detection performance of this model. On average, this model produces promising results by scoring up 93.87%, 10.39%, and 93.12% accuracy, recall, and precision, respectively, which is considerably better than the other state-of-the-art detection models. It is pertinent to say that pre-processing and automatic data augmentation, reducing the noisy data and overfitting while preserving the high performance of proposed classifiers. As future work, feature selection approaches can be utilized to reduce the data dimensionality and enhance the classification performance. In addition, other textual features might be considered to boost the performance of detection process.</figDesc><table><row><cell>R T I C L E</cell></row><row><cell>A</cell></row><row><cell>Model CNN based RNN based FakeDetector CNNLSTM Proposed R E T R A Accuracy (%) Recall (%) 83 15.42 81.07 19.33 86.03 13.96 91.77 12.26 93.87 10.39 C T E D Precision (%) 90.01 87.12 91 93.12 90.09</cell></row></table></figure>
