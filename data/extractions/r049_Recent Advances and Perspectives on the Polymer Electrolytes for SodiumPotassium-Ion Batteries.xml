<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, the demand for energy storage systems has been upsurging in many fields. Due to high voltage and energy density, good cycle stability, and less self-discharge performance, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in various industries, such as portable electronic equipment and electric vehicles since the commercial LIBs were released for the first time in 1991. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> Based on the Li metal anode, LIBs can reach a specific energy of 440 Wh Kg <ref type="bibr">-1</ref> , and further increase to 650/950 Wh Kg -1 for Li-S/Li-air battery systems, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> However, environmental concerns and high-cost issues hinder the further commercial applications of LIBs, stemming from the low earth reserves and uneven distribution of the lithium resources (70% reserved in South America). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> Compared with that in 1991, the cost of lithium resources has almost been double, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> which goes against the development of the commercial applications. Besides, the insufficient abundance of lithium resources also poses a restriction to their potential application in large-scale energy storage fields.</p><p>One of the promising solutions is to develop sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> because of the high natural abundances (2.83 wt% for sodium and 2.59 wt% for potassium vs 0.002 wt% for lithium) and homogeneous distribution of sodium and potassium resources in the Earth's crust. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the physical and chemical properties of Li, Na, and K elements. As seen, closely redox potentials of Na + /Na and K + /K (-2.71 V for Na + /Na and -2.91 V for K + /K versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) to Li + /Li (-3.04 V vs SHE), <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> smaller Stokes radius in propylene carbonate (PC) and water, and similar electrochemical activities of Na + /K + ions bestow SIBs/KIBs with great potentials to sever as next-generation electrochemical energy storage systems for replacing LIBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> In recent years, relevant works and reports on SIBs and KIBs have been exponentially increasing due to their appreciable application potentials in the largescale energy storage field. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> statistically summarizes the yearly amounts of the reported scientific papers on SIBs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and KIBs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) from 2010 to 2019, Owing to the low cost of sodium/potassium resources and similar electrochemical properties of Na + /K + to Li + , sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are regarded as promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in large-scale energy storage field. However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety. However, the poor processibility and relatively low ionic conductivity of Na + and K + ions limit the further practical applications of ISEs. PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na + /K + ion transfer is summarized. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/KIBs based on PEs are presented. Finally, some suggestions and perspectives are put forward to provide some possible directions for the follow-up researches. respectively. As observed, in the past decade, the yearly number rapidly increases from several to hundreds, even thousands, suggesting that more and more efforts have been devoted to developing SIBs and KIBs.</p><p>In battery systems, electrolytes play a vital role in delivering the performance of batteries. For example, their coulombic efficiency of batteries closely relates to the electrochemical stability windows of electrolytes. Based on the molecular orbital theory, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/ lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy correspond to the oxidative decomposition potential (ODP)/reductive decomposition potential (RDP), respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> When the ODP of cathode above the HOMO (or the RDP of anode below the LUMO) of electrolytes, some undesirable side reactions will occur at electrode/electrolyte interfaces such as electrolyte decomposition and formation of the passivation layer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> To suppress these side reactions, the LUMO of electrolytes should be lower than the reduction energy of anode, as well as the HOMO of the electrolytes should be higher than the oxidation energy of the cathode, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> which play a decisive role in the thermodynamic stability and voltage stable window of electrolytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> A wider voltage stable window also Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameters</head><p>Besides, the solvation effect between solvent molecules and cation/anion is associated with the ionic kinetics and the stability of batteries. The intercalation/deintercalation and stripping/plating behaviors of active cations are always accompanied by the solvation/desolvation processes, which influence the kinetics of cations migration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> and Table 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> schematically show the covalent radius of Li + , Na + , K + and their corresponding desolvation energy in several typical organic solvents. On the one hand, a larger solvation structure may prevent cationic intercalation/deintercalation possess, thus results in kinetics retardation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> On the other hand, the desolvation energy represents the difficulty degree of solvation/desolvation processes. Furthermore, due to that solvation sheath molecules are supposed to be together with the cation diffusion, the solvent molecules may be first reduced by electrons and form the main ingredient of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> The selection of solvent components plays a key role in the formation of SEI. Therefore, the solvation effect is directly related to the ionic transfer kinetics in batteries.</p><p>Further, the growth of dendrites and the flammability of electrolytes have raised serious safety concerns of batteries. A better fluidity of electrolytes enables faster transfer of ions and better interface infiltration as well, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> which ensures the contact between electrode and electrolyte. In this regard, liquid-phase electrolytes show an obvious superiority over solid-phase electrolytes. When electrolyte changes from the liquid-phase to quasi-/solid phase, the interfacial contact becomes the main challenge; however, the enhanced mechanical strength and nonleakage nature is conducive to inhibiting the growth of dendrites and improving the safety (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> Accordingly, it is of great significance to choose a suitable electrolyte for batteries. In consideration of the relatively high working voltage windows of SIBs and KIBs, one of the most widely used electrolytes is nonaqueous liquid electrolytes based on different organic solvents (PC, EC, EMC, DEC, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), dimethoxyethane (DME), etc.), electrolyte salts (sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF 6 ), potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF 6 ), sodium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide (NaTFSI), potassium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (KTFSI), sodium perchlorate (NaClO 4 ), sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI), potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI), etc.), and additives (FEC, VC, etc.). <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> In addition, aqueous liquid electrolytes (water as solvent), ionic liquid electrolytes, and quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes have also been attracting considerable attentions due to their high safety. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref> Among these, the type of quasi-/solid-phase polymer electrolytes (PEs) has been attracted growing interest because PEs combine advantages of both liquid-phase electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> Since Wright et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> developed a PE composed of polyethylene (PEO) and alkali metal salt in 1973, substantial researches and efforts have been carried out toward high-performance PEs, which primarily focused on ion transfer mechanism, electrolyte/electrode interface, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> Up to now, various polymer matrix materials have been explored such as PEO, poly(vinylidene fluoridehexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), poly(vinylpyrrolidone)  <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> Copyright 2010, American Chemical Society. b) Schematic covalent radius (halo part) and ionic radius (solid part). c) Dendritic growth in liquid (left) and solid (right) electrolyte, the electrode/electrolyte interface is amplified to observe interface contact.</p><p>(PVP), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), etc. Although electrolytes using polymers as the host material are potential and advantageous, their properties remain to be improved, for example, ionic conductivity, cycling stability, etc. In the past decade, the yearly amounts of reported papers on PE-based SIBs and KIBs and corresponding specific citation frequencies were growing exponentially (insets in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Besides, Na/K metal anodes are capable of delivering high theoretical specific capacity and negligible volume changes accompanied by Na + /K + plating/stripping during charge/ discharge processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> However, these metal anodes endow with high reactivity, which poses restriction on the development of Na/K metal anode-based SIBs and KIBs. Therefore, considering the inherent merits of PEs, combining PEs and sodium/ potassium metal anodes is a promising path and maybe pave the way for next-generation energy storage systems. In this paper, we first discuss the advantages of different electrolytes and summarize the performance requirements for SIBs/KIBs. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/ KIBs based on PEs are presented. Finally, some suggestions and perspectives are put forward, hoping to be helpful for the follow-up researches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Advantages and Ionic Migration Mechanism of PEs for SIBs/KIBs</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, great devotions have been made toward high-performance electrolytes for SIBs/KIBs in recent years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref> Generally, the electrolyte community commonly includes five types of organic liquid electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, ionic liquid electrolytes, ISEs, and PEs. Compared with others, each type presents some unique merits. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> summarizes the critical performances of these electrolytes and makes comparisons among them.</p><p>Commonly, liquid-phase electrolytes endow with higher ionic conductivities (10 -2 to 1 S cm -1 ) than that of ISEs and PEs (10 -7 to 10 -3 S cm -1 ) due to their good fluidity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> One of the most widely used electrolytes is organic liquid electrolytes. Once a suitable electrolyte has been designed, this type of electrolytes allows good electrochemical compatibility with electrode materials. However, their inherent flammability, ease leakage, and poor thermal stability give rise to serious safety concerns of combustion and explosion. In addition, possible side reactions and dendrite issues also pose challenges on the SIBs and KIBs based on organic liquid electrolytes. Particularly, in dual-ion battery (DIB) systems, high potentials (&gt;4.5 V) of anion intercalation into graphite cathode generally result in the occurrence of severe side reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> In contrast, aqueous electrolytes (water as solvent) and ionic liquid electrolytes show great safety superiority due to their natural nonflammability. Besides, aqueous electrolytes are favorable due to their environmental benignity and low cost. Nevertheless, the insufficient voltage window of aqueous electrolytes bestows aqueous SIBs and KIBs with low working voltages, and resultantly limited energy densities, even though "water-in-salt" strategy is able to obviously widen the electrochemical stability windows of aqueous electrolytes, allowing upper voltage of 2.5 V. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> Besides, the dissolution of transition metal elements in aqueous electrolytes is also undesirable for improving the cycling performance of batteries. Differing from aqueous electrolytes, ionic liquid electrolytes are endued with strong tolerance to high voltage up to 5.0 V. Consequently, the application of ionic liquid electrolytes has attracted growing attention, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> particularly in the DIB community. Unfortunately, their further application is restricted by the high cost, high viscosity, and insufficient compatibility with electrode materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> More importantly, the dendrite growth and propagation are the main challenges facing Na/K-metal anode-based batteries with liquid-phase electrolytes (e.g., organic liquid electrolytes and ionic liquid electrolytes). <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref> It follows that these liquid-phase electrolytes individually show some intrinsic deficiencies and are incapable of satisfying the comprehensive requirements of high safety, wide  voltage stability windows, low cost, etc. Instead of these, quasi-/ solid-phase electrolytes, including ISEs and PEs, have been being developed in recent years. Compared with liquid-phase electrolytes, the quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes take some great advantages of high safety, wide voltage window, and good thermal stability. 1) High safety: quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes can effectively prevent from the presence of liquid leakage and greatly improve the safety of batteries; 2) Wide voltage window: quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes are allowed to have enhanced electrochemical redox stability and resultantly to endow with a wide voltage window, which can readily match high-voltage cathode materials and provide feasibility for improving the energy density of batteries; 3) good thermal stability: quasi-/ solid-phase electrolytes are capable of inhibiting the accident induced by thermal runaway. However, for ISEs, the main challenges are their low ionic conductivity originating from the sluggish kinetics of Na + ions and K + ions, and poor interfacial contact between electrolyte and electrodes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> Although sulfide ISEs have been reported to present high ionic conductivity for Na + ions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref> their vulnerability to ambient atmosphere poses restriction to the practical application. Meanwhile, ISEs also endow with a poor large-scale processibility due to their natural brittleness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88]</ref> Compared with liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, PEs also show other comprehensive superiorities. For example i) appropriate mechanical strength of PEs enables the uniform plating/ stripping of active alkali metal ions on the surface of anode and resultantly suppresses the formation and growth of dendrites. And ii) excellent flexibility, different from the natural brittleness of ISEs, bestows PEs with great potential in the field of wearable energy-storage devices. It is also noteworthy that, compared with ISEs, PEs can effectively accommodate volume changes of electrode materials during the charging/discharging processes without compromising interfacial contact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> iii) Good processibility and facile/scalable preparation processes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> particularly for in situ polymerized PEs, enable great processing compatibility with the existing preparation procedures of batteries based on liquid-phase electrolytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> Furthermore, iv) PEs take advantage of good interfacial contact and electrochemical compatibility over ISEs because the natural rigidity of the latter generally results in the presence of interfacial gaps and resultantly poor interfacial contact between electrolyte and electrodes. v) PEs are more conducive to realizing high ionic conductivity for the transfer of Na + ions and K + ions at room temperature or even at low temperature than ISEs, due to the large ionic radii of active ions and different ion migration mechanism between PEs and ISEs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> vi) PEs also have some other merits of lightweight, high-volume utilization, and good film-forming ability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> To further improve the electrochemical properties of PEs, it is of significance to get fundamental insight into the migration mechanism and transfer kinetics of active ions in PEs. It is generally accepted that the Li + -ion migration in PEs is affected by the fracture/formation of coordination bonds in the segmented movement of polymer chains, which mainly occurs in the amorphous region of the polymer matrices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> For example, Li + ions first locate at the active site provided by the polar group of PEs (e.g., O in PEO). Under the driving of the electric field, the local segmental motion of polymer chains induces Li + ions to move/leap from one coordination site to another adjacent active site, and thus realizes ion migration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> It is theoretically reasonable to infer that the migration of Na + /K + ions in PEs shares a similar mechanism with that of Li + ions, since Na + /K + ions have similar electrochemical activity with Li + ions. However, it is noteworthy that the migration process of different active ions in PEs is not only associated with the type of active ions (ionic radius, charge density, etc.) and inactive ions (bonds with polymer matrix), but also involves the dielectric constant, amorphous phase characteristics, mobility of the polymer matrix, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> summarizes the merits and deficiencies of several typical PE matrices. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), one of the most typical polymers for PEs, has a repeating CH 2 CH 2 O (EO) group with lone pair electrons that can be attached by metal ions. The PEO-based electrolytes show excellent salt dissociation ability and good mechanical strength and advantages of being relatively cheap and not susceptible to moisture. However, the low ionic conductivity induced by the high crystallinity and narrow electrochemical window at room temperature limits their development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref> Poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), consisting of a crystalline phase (-VDF) for mechanical enhancement and an amorphous phase (-HFP) for reducing the degree of crystallinity, exhibits a high dielectric constant (ε = 8.4), outstanding mechanical strength, excellent electrochemical stability, and thermal stability, and is one of the most commonly used PE matrices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> Due to extremely low glass transition temperature of polyphosphazenes (PAN), PAN-based electrolytes are conducive to improving ionic conductance, and have excellent oxidation resistance and thermal stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> However, their mechanical strength and reduction-resistive ability are not sufficient, and their synthesis route is relatively complex. The rich ester group in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) has a strong interaction with the oxygen atoms in the carbonate plasticizer, resulting in its strong ability to dissolve massive liquid electrolytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> Therefore, the PMMA-based PEs generally have a high ionic conductivity. The presence of a large number of side-chain carbonyl groups in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) endows with excellent dissociation ability and a high amorphous region, allowing faster ion migration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> In addition, PVP can provide excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength for blended materials. Relatively cheap poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) also contains rich CCl bond, which makes it have a strong binding ability with electrolyte salts, and is compatible with a large number of plasticizers. Therefore, the rational design of PEs should fully take into consideration the components of PE matrices and the type of electrolyte salts. In the next two sections, the advance of PEs for SIBs and KIBs will be summarized and reviewed in detail.</p></div>

Further, Arya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> comparatively studied the effect of different shapes of TiO 2 nanoparticles (nanofiller vs nanorod) on electrochemical properties of SPEs, and showed that the ionic conductivity was sensitive to the shape of nanoparticles, and the PE with the addition of TiO 2 nanorods presented superior properties (dielectric nature, electrochemical window, ionic conductivity) than that added with TiO 2 nanofillers.</p><p>NASICON-type ISE materials can also be applied as the fillers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> On the one hand, the addition of NASICON-based fillers is beneficial to promote the amorphization of PEO, and on the other hand, can serve as the high-speed ionic channels for Na + ions transfer.

Consequently, the assembled battery with the configuration of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ||PEO/CQDs-Na||Na exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 101.5 mAh g -1 at 1 C and a capacity retention of 88% after 100 cycles.

Compare to the liquid-phase electrolytes with excellent wettability, solid-phase electrolytes generally suffer from fewer contact sites and higher interface resistance because of their poor fluidity along with an insufficient contact area between electrodes and electrolyte. And, the issue of interfacial compatibility between electrodes and electrolyte also results in sluggish kinetics of Na + transport. Therefore, improving the electrodes/electrolyte interfacial contact is of great significance for enhancing the rate performance as well as the cycle stability of solid-state batteries. A typical PE was composed of PEO matrix and NaFSI salt (PEO 20 NaFSI) with a molar ratio of 20 (EO/Na + ). However, when the PE was paired with pure Na metal anode to form Na||PEO 20 NaFSI||Na symmetric cells, the electrochemical polarization for Na plating/stripping was obviously enlarged after some cycles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref> Accordingly, in order to improve the interfacial compatibility between the PE and Na metal anode, Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> introduced a carbon matrix into the Na metal anode to construct a Na/C composite anode (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>). On the one hand, the carbon material was stable toward Na metal anode with high reactivity and had a strong bond with Na metal. Besides, the ionic and electronic conductivities of the carbon were conducive to boosting the Na plating/stripping. On the other hand, the carbon material was likely to form strong covalent bonds with PEO due to their possible reactions between them and to prevent the PE from the delamination, and thus to enhance the interfacial connectivity between SPE and the Na metal anodes. Additionally, the carbon matrix with a 3D structure would effectively distribute Na plating/stripping onto a large surface area and reduce the local current density on the composite anode, and hence was expected to enhance the cycling reversibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> Such a modification bestowed the Na/C||PEO 20 NaFSI||Na/C symmetric cell with a lower electrochemical overpotential of ±80 mV at 0.6 mA, and enhanced cycling stability up to 800 h at 0.3 mA (tested at 80 °C). In contrast, a short circuit was presented after 138 cycles for Na||PEO 20 NaFSI||Na. A full cell with a configuration of Na/C|| PEO 20 NaFSI||Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 was assembled to study the effect of the interfacial modification. As a result, the full cell delivered a higher reversible capacity of ≈111 mAh g -1 and smaller electrochemical overpotential of ≈36 mA at 0.1 C (vs 102 mAh g -1 and 60 mV, respectively, for Na||PEO 20 NaFSI||Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ). Besides, with a modified Na/C anode, the full cell presented a reinforced cycle performance (capacity retention above 92 %, 80%, 70% after 2000, 5000, 8000 cycles, respectively). <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> </p></div>

The obtained SPE not only presented excellent mechanical properties, enabling the suppression of sodium dendrites, but also possessed good electrochemical stability up to 4.7 V and a high ionic conductivity even at low temperature (1.59 × 10 -4 S cm -1 at ambient temperature and 2.85 × 10 -6 S cm -1 at -35 °C). Consequently, the assembled Na||PFSA-Na-SPE||Na symmetric cell exhibited excellent cycling reversibility of 300 h at 0.5 mA cm -2 (room temperature). The SPE was further assembled into a full cell with Na metal anode and Prussian blue (HQ-NaFe) cathode, which delivered a high reversible specific capacity of over 120 mAh g -1 at 0.5 C, rate capability of 87.5 mA h g -1 at 8 C, and a long cycling life with a capacity retention of ≈85% after 1100 cycles at 1 C. Surprisingly, the full cell exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performance at low temperature with a discharge capacity of almost 92.0 mAh g -1 at -15 °C (76% retention compared to capacity at room temperature) and 100% Coulombic efficiency, demonstrating inconspicuous electrochemical polarization.

Finally, with a molar ratio of 80:20, the SPE delivered a maximum conductivity above 10 -5 S cm -1 at 25 °C and a cationic transference number of ca. 0.5 at 80 °C.

With the microporous graphene (MG) and disordered carbon (DC) serving as cathode and anode, respectively, the capacitors showed a high voltage of 4.2 V with an energy density of 168 Wh Kg -1 , and it also maintained 85% specific capacitance after 1200 cycles.</p><p>Besides, matrix materials such as nonwoven fabrics, glass fibers (GFs) were also exploited to improve mechanical strength. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref> Gao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref> used GFs as scaffold covered by PVDF-HFP to prepare a composite GPE, the porous structure of GFs provided micrometer-sized channels as well as enhanced mechanical strength.

On the other hand, aiming to modify the hydrophobic property of PVDF-HFP, a very thin hydrophilic coating of polydopamine (PDA) was introduced to regulate the surficial performance of the PVDF-HFP polymer. As a result, the as-prepared GPE (1 m NaClO 4 in PC/GF/PVDF-HFP/PDA) showed an ionic conductivity of 5.4 × 10 -3 S cm -1 at 25 °C and a stable voltage up to 4.8 V (vs Na/Na + ).

PVDF-HFP with good liquid-retention capability could match with amorphous phase PMMA, and the blended GPE showed superior ionic conductivity. As the content of nano-Al 2 O 3 increased to 6 wt%, an ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10 -3 S cm -1 was obtained at room temperature. In addition to this, Chandni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref> tried to combine PEO with PAN, which exhibited an ionic conductivity of about ≈10 -4 S cm -1 (EO/AN: Na = 20, 20 wt% TiO 2 ).</p><p>Kumar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref> added SiO 2 nanofillers into PMMA/NaClO 4 / EC/PC system.

The GPE presented a wide electrochemical window of about 5 V and stayed stable over the temperature range of -80 to 140 °C, which proved the potential of PMMA for application in SIBs. Similarly, Rao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref> used ZrO 2 as nanofillers to construct PVP/NaPO 3 /ZrO 2 GPE, which also delivered a high ionic conductivity of 2.14 × 10 -3 S cm -1 for Na + -ion transfer at room temperature.</p><p>The existence of CN groups in polymer materials is beneficial to boost the transfer of active cations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref> Hence, PAN with CN groups was exploited to replace CO active groups in PEO. Osman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref> prepared a system of PAN/24 wt% NaCF 3 SO 3 , which had an ionic conductivity of 7.13 × 10 -4 S cm -1 at room temperature, even higher than that of 3.04 × 10 -4 S cm -1 of Li-ion system (PAN/26 wt% LiCF 3 SO 3 ), which was attributed to the weaker interaction between Na + cations and the unique N atoms in PAN, promoting the migration of Na + ions. Lately, Manuel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> reported a PAN-based GPE, in which 1 m NaClO 4 dissolved in an organic solvent (EC/PC/DME = 1/1/1 in volume ratio), and PAN serving as the PE matrix, which presented an ionic conductivity of 3.01 × 10 -3 S cm -1 at room temperature. Assembled with a nanocomposite (polyimide (PI)/ multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)) as the cathode and Na metal as the anode, the obtained battery with PAN-based GPE delivered an initial discharge capacity of 98 mAh g -1 , which slightly increased to 100 mAh g -1 after a few stabilization cycles and 82.5 mAh g -1 was remained after 3000 cycles (about 84% of the initial discharge capacity).</p><p>Recently, Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> reported a multifunctional GPE based ethoxylated pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (EPTA) by in situ thermal polymerization method. The EPTA could regulate anion and cation fluxes to homogenize the Na plating and make anion intercalation smoothly. They adopted PC: EMC (1:1, v:v) plasticizer with FEC as cosolvent and 1,3-pro-panesultone (PS) as an additive, which facilitated the formation of SEI/cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the anode/cathode side, bringing about stable cycle performance and a wider electrochemical window. The NaPF 6 /EPTA/PC/EMC/FEC/PS system exhibited high ionic conductivity of 5.33 × 10 -3 S cm -1 at 25 °C and wide electrochemical stable voltage window up to 5.5 V versus Na/Na + .

Compared with the Na + ion radius (0.97 Å), K + ion has a larger ion radius (1.33 Å), which limits the choice of electrodes. However, the electrochemical redox potential of K + /K is more close to Li + (-2.93 V of K + /K and -3.04 V of Li + /Li), so that KIBs can theoretically deliver a higher working platform. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178]</ref> Moreover, potassium has good flexibility, enabling better contact between materials and can expand the application field of technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">179,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">180]</ref> Therefore, KIBs also have good research value and application potentials.

As observed in Figure <ref type="figure">9a</ref>, the conductivity of the SPE film increased as the concentration of KBr increased gradually. Because the crystallinity of the polymer decreased along with the increasing complexation of salt and electrolyte, and the segmental chain movement became easier. Then, the maximum conductivity (5.0 × 10 -7 S cm -1 ) was obtained when the weight ratio of PEO/KBr was 70:30. As the concentration continued to increase, the conductivity decreased, possibly ascribable to ion binding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> Besides, when the mass ratio of KBr was greater than 50%, the prepared electrolyte membrane was fragile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">184]</ref> Similarly, Agrawal et al. studied the effect of potassium acetate (CH 3 COOK) concentration on the conductivity of PEO-based polymers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref> A poly(ethylene oxide)-potassium acetate (PEO-CH 3 COOK) SPE was prepared via a hot-press cast method and delivered an ionic conductivity of 2.74 × 10 -7 S cm -1 at room temperature when the PEO/ CH 3 COOK weight ratio was 95:5.</p><p>This phenomenon shows that different salts may have different effects on the same polymer body.

Further, the SPE was assembled into a full cell with the configuration of K||PEO-50%KFSI||Ni 3 S 2 @Ni.

The net repulsion between the chain segments leads to the local separation structure at the nanometer level, which can well control the ion transport and the mechanical properties of the film. <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref> When metal salts are added to these copolymer matrices to form a rubber-like solid, they still have high ionic conductivities. Via an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method, Kim et al. synthesized a comb polymer (PECH-g-POEM). The polymer consisted of the main PECH chain and the side chain POEM (mass ratio: 60:40). The chlorine atom in the main chain was used as the starting site and grafted with the side chain. KI was added to the polymer matrix, and the ionic conductivity (3.7 × 10 -5 S cm -1 ) at room temperature reached the highest value when the concentration reached 15 wt%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref> The good electrochemical properties of the KCPEs indicate that the copolymerization method is promising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Inorganic Fillers</head><p>The preparation of commixture KCPEs by adding inorganic fillers can also improve the ionic conductivity. There have been many reports on other metal ionic electrolytes. Inorganic fillers can be divided into two types according to their contributions: passive and active fillers. Passive fillers (Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , TiO 2 , etc.) can not only improve the mechanical properties of PE, but also improve the ionic conductivity of PE because of their Lewis acid surface groups and large specific surface areas. Active fillers are involved in the transport of K + and contribute to conductivity, and induce complex conductive behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">201]</ref> De et al. studied the effect of CeO 2 nanoparticle (size ≈ 10 nm) on the morphology and ionic conductivity of PEO/KI KCPE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[199]</ref> As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10a</ref>, pure PEO presented a regular crystal network. After the addition of KI, salt complexation with PEO destroyed the crystal structure. With the addition of CeO 2 , the morphology of the PEs became flatter (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10b</ref>). The good microstructure could improve ion conductivity. The ratio of PEO/KI was kept at 80:20 and 85:15, and the influence of different proportion of CeO 2 on the conductivity was studied (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10c</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10c</ref> shows the presence of two conductivity maxima. When the content of CeO 2 was less than 5 wt%, the osmotic conduction paths were formed around the nanoparticles, and the trans-arrangement of PEO improved the ionic conductivity of the KCPE. When the content of CeO 2 was between 5 and 10 wt%, the interaction between Lewis acid and base led to gauche arrangement of PEO main chains, which inhibited the PEO phase motion and reduced the ionic conductivity; Above 10 wt%, CeO 2 interacted with the ether oxide groups (solvated with K + ), weakened their binding with K + , and improved the conductivity. When 20 wt% CeO 2 was added, the ionic conductivity reached the highest value (2.15 × 10 -3 S cm -1 ). Compared with the pure-PEO/KI system (1.53 × 10 -5 S cm -1 ) at room temperature, the ionic conductivity increased by two orders of magnitude. When CeO 2 concentration was too high, its strong interaction with PEO could lead to the increase of polymer matrix crystallinity.</p><p>Besides, the nanoparticle SiO 2 (size ≈ 8 nm) was also used to prepare the K + conducting composite KCPE. Chandra designed a composite SPE by mixing ((1-x) [70PEO:30KBr] with nanoparticle SiO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref> The influence of the composition and temperature on the conductivity of the KCPE was investigated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10d</ref>). The results showed that the ionic conductivity of [95 wt% (70PEO:30KBr) +5 wt%SiO 2 )] KCPE was 2.5 × 10 -5 S cm -1 . Compared with their previous work (70PEO:30KBr), the KCPE delivered an increased conductivity by two orders of magnitude, which was ascribed as that the interaction between the PEO backbone and the SiO 2 filler provided more jump sites for K + and promoted ion migration.</p><p>Agrawal et al. found in their study on PEO/KNO 3 KCPEs that when the mass ratio was 95:5 and 70:30, the KCPE had a high ionic conductivity at room temperature of 2.76 × 10 -7 S cm -1 and 4.31 × 10 -7 S cm -1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[197]</ref> Based on these two KCPEs, they used KI as an active filler and adopted two different strategies to improve ionic conductivity. For the first approach involved physical/hot mixed process, in which the different mass fractions of KI (as second-phase filler dispersoid) were dispersed into the PEO matrix, and this could increase the fraction of amorphous PEO. Using this method, the conductivity of both CPEs ions was improved. The ionic conductivity at room temperature of [(95 wt%PEO + 5KNO 3 ) + 7 KI] and [(70PEO + 30KNO 3 ) + 10 KI] KCPEs was 6.15 × 10 -7 and 3.98 × 10 -7 S cm -1 . The ionic conductivity increased by an order of magnitude. The second method was to mix KNO 3 and KI according to the optimal ratio obtained by the previous method, and then to grind the balls at different times followed by a hot pressing method to prepare CPEs. The results showed that the nano-ionic effect at the boundary of KNO 3 and KI phase could be induced by ball grinding and the ionic conductivity could be improved. ) and a high voltage window (4.9 V vs K/K + ) at room temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11a</ref>). The batteries configured with polyaniline/K were assembled with the GPE and traditional organic liquid electrolyte, respectively. Compared with liquidphase electrolytes, the GPE offered better cycle performance (98% discharge capacity retention rate after 100 cycles at 50 mA g -1 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.3% over the whole cycle) and superior rate capability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). Compared with other KIBs, the electrochemical performance of this work was also outstanding. The excellent cycling performance and high coulombic efficiency were mainly attributed to the fact that the KCPE could inhibit the side reactions on the electrode surface and the growth of potassium dendrites, thus establishing a stable interface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref> On the basis of the success of a blending GPE membrane in a Li + -based DIB system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref> the same group applied a similar approach to prepare a K + -based GPE membrane (PVDF-HFP/ PEO(95:5,w/w) + 1 m KPF 6 /EC/DMC/EMC (4:3:2,v:v:v)) and assembled a Sn||AC flexible potassium ion mixing capacitor (PIHC). <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[203]</ref> PVDF-HFP had the advantages of relatively low crystallinity, high ionic conductivity and good mechanical strength. The addition of PEO could form an H-F hydrogen bond with PVDF-HFP, which was beneficial to improve the pore structure. Compared to organic electrolytes (capacity gradually decreased after 400 cycles), PIHC based on the GPE (2000 cycles of stable cycles) showed good cycling stability. SEM characterizations of tin anode suggested that the surface of the tin foil after 500 cycles in the organic electrolyte presented serious pulverization and cracks, while that in the PIHC with the GPE was still relatively smooth and flat after 2000 cycles. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11e</ref> shows the advantages of GPEs including a uniform de-/alloying process and mitigation of volume change.</p></div>

Besides, PEs endow with some other merits of flame-retardancy, no leakage and volatility, thermal/electrochemical stability and flexibility, and show great potential for the application in batteries. Due to the shortage of lithium resources and severe concern of safety, the development of PE-based SIBs and KIBs is a popular trend. At present, the relative researches are still in its infancy, but it is realistic that this field will advance the application of next-generation clean energy in the near future. Therefore, PEs, as a potential electrolyte in SIBs and KIBs, still need further studies. Herein, we enumerated the latest development of PEs and also discussed their working mechanism and modification strategies.</p><p>In the past decade, different design strategies, including blending, crosslinking, copolymerization, nanofillers, etc., have been proposed to boost the development toward high-performance Na + /K + -based PEs. For PEs, the basic requirements include high enough ionic conductivity (&gt;10 -4 S cm -1 ), transference number close to unity, mechanical strength, toughness, wide electrochemical window and stability, good interfacial compatibility with electrodes, etc. Currently, it is noteworthy that the main shortages of Na + /K + -based SPEs and GPEs are low ionic conductivity, insufficient mechanical properties, etc., which hinder the ongoing steps toward practical application. It is necessary to modify the electrolyte systems further or develop new PE systems. For example, the next-goal for GPEs might be to enhance their mechanical strength and to increase the porosity of GPEs for containing and maintaining more liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, for SPEs, the low ionic conductivities are the main hurdle remaining to be overcome.</p><p>From the perspective of practical application, Na + /K + -based PEs should meet some ideal performance requirements for SIBs/KIBs, such as: high ionic conductivity, high cation migration number, appropriate mechanical strength, excellent chemical and thermal stability, etc.</p><p>1. High ionic conductivity: Ionic conductivity is an important index to evaluate the performance of PEs and reflects the ability of PEs to transport alkali metal ions (Na + , K + ). However, as mentioned above, the conductivity of Na + /K + -based PEs (10 -6 to 10 -3 S cm -1 ), particularly SPEs, is much lower than that of conventional liquid electrolytes (10 -3 to 10 -2 S cm -1 ), especially at room temperature. The ionic conductivity of the Na + / K + -based PEs must be at least 10 -3 S cm -1 in order for SIBs/ KIBs to have good cycle and rate performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref> The relevant design strategies include blending, cross-linking and inorganic fillers, plasticizer/solvent addition, etc. Besides, the concentration of salts also has a great influence on PEs, in which too low is unconducive to the generation of energy carriers and too high will affect the structure of molecular skeleton chains. 2. High cation migration number (T + ≈ 1). The cation migration number is a measure of the cation mobility in the PEs relative to the anion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> Reverse movement of anions without being deposited on the electrodes can cause concentration polarization, which results in increased internal impedances and reduced discharge voltages. Single ion conductive PE is used to limit the anion and increase the cation conductivity by covalently binding the anion to the polymer chain or adding an anion acceptor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[204]</ref> Therefore, how to restrict the migration Reproduced with permission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref> Copyright 2018, Wiley-VCH. d) Schematic illustration of the failure mechanism of the Sn anode in the liquid electrolyte and the protection mechanism of the gel PE.

However, note that different from in "rocking-chair" battery systems, in a DIB system, active ions include both cations and anions, which needs a comparable ion transfer kinetics for cations and anions. 3. Appropriate mechanical strength: Good mechanical properties enable the suppression of the dendrite growth, and at the same time, it cannot be as fragile as some inorganic solid electrolytes, which have seldom relaxation elasticity under pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205]</ref> PEs based on linear polymer chains have less mechanical properties, especially GPEs (plasticizers are added to improve ionic conductivity). Some methods to improve the mechanical strength of PEs cover crosslinking, inorganic fillers, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[201,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">205]</ref> 4. Wide electrochemical voltage window (0-5 V): The oxidation potential should be higher than the intercalation potential of alkali metal ions or anions into the cathode, and the reduction potential should be lower than that of alkali metal ions in the anode. Matching a high voltage cathode material is beneficial to increase the energy density of SIBs/KIBs. The electrochemical voltage window is directly associated with the components of PE matrices and plasticizers, the type and concentration of salt, synthesis procedure, etc. and rational design is of significance. 5. Excellent thermal stability: In addition to that PEs should be inert relative to other battery electrode components to avoid electrochemical instability and detrimental side reactions, the excellent thermal stability of PEs can ensure the safety of batteries even operated at a high-temperature environment or under some emergency circumstances of the short circuit, overcharge, etc. Introducing nonflammable components or additives is a feasible strategy to improve the thermal stability of PEs.</p><p>Last but not least, the interface issues between electrode and electrolyte are a critical topic in batteries. When the interface is in loose contact, the ion transport rate and the cycle stability of the batteries are limited. Moreover, the unstable electrode/ electrolyte interfaces will allow the occurrence of side reactions and dendrites. A more in-depth discussion on the interface mechanism might be of great help to battery performance. Pointing at the development of Na + /K + -based quasi-/solid electrolytes, studies also should focus on environmental protection and cost reduction, and developing high safety, non-toxic, degradable and accessible materials, such as cellulose and polysaccharide.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a,b) Yearly statistic amounts of the reported scientific papers on SIBs and KIBs, and c,d) their specific citation frequencies (from 2010 to 2019).
