<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>*e use of computer programs to simulate hand-made artworks is one of the key goals of nonrealistic drawing techniques. To date, researchers in the field of computer graphics have developed many nonrealistic algorithms to simulate Western artworks, such as oil paintings, watercolours, drawings, and prints.</p><p>In the last decade, many scholars in China have also started to work on nonrealistic algorithms for traditional Chinese ink painting styles. One approach is to extract the contour lines of the model <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>, then stylize the contour lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, and then control the stylized parameters to simulate the drawing of the brush. *is approach is more complex to implement, and the extraction of contour lines in the graphics space and the visible judgement of stylisation can affect the real-time rendering speed. *e second method is based on the traditional cartoon rendering algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5]</ref>, which controls the ink texture mapping by designing a specific lighting function to achieve the ink style rendering effect, which is simple, realistic, and has good real-time performance.</p><p>In 1997, Curtis pioneered the use of Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory in the simulation of watercolours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. In that paper, the user selects the reflection values of the pigments against a black and white background so that the K and S values can be calculated, and the final colour output is then calculate using the superimposition and mixing formulae of the KM colour model. In 2003, Rudolf used the same theory for the simulation of crayon paintings based on Curtis, who used KM theory to solve the problems that arose when composing two layers of images. 2004 saw Yamamoto use the KM theory for the simulation of watercolours. In 2004, Yamamoto also used KM colour theory in his study of the conversion of digital images into pencil drawings, but it allowed for user-defined colour transparency, i.e., assuming that the value of the colour parameter would not change on a white background, but setting a parameter to a certain scale on a black background, thus controlling the transparency of the colour. *e above are all simulation of Western painting, in the case of ink painting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, Suarez <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> tried to introduce the KM colour model during the final colouring.</p><p>*e study of diffusion of different pigments was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, but did not really address the diffusion and superimposition effects of different pigments. Only a single KM colour model was used to simulate the colour of different pigments. Since there is no substantial improvement</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>of the diffusion model, the simulation of the final effect cannot be satisfactorily obtained. *e literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref> gives an interactive 3D virtual brush model that uses subdivision surfaces around a skeleton based on a spring system to represent the geometry of the brush; this method is not suitable for generating the bifurcation effect of the brush. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref> proposed calculating the deformation of the brush hair based on the physical properties of the springs based on the theory of elasticity, which is difficult to achieve in real time when the number of hair is large. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> proposed a model based on the bristle entity, which simulates the bifurcation using replication parameters to generate bristles with the same structure resulting in a lack of close correlation between the bristles and an unrealistic shape of the bifurcated bristles. *e quill model constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> constrains the spring deformation by means of energy minimisation. *is method is only applicable to small-scale deformations and works better for simulating wet brushes without bifurcation.</p><p>*e first paper model of 2D fibre structure was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> that plane was proposed to be divided into small regions, and a large number of curves with random orientations were distributed within each region to simulate fibre bundles. *en <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> and others proposed their own paper models. *is type of paper model achieves better results to some extent, but there are still several fundamental problems: first, it does not consider the effect of different types of rice paper on the diffusion effect and is an uncontrollable paper model that lacks scalability; second, it also does not take into account how to represent the paper texture.</p><p>In Pingping <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>, based on a summary of previous work, the smallest unit of the paper plane is partitioned into paper cells (one pixel corresponds to multiple paper cells), while multiple adjacent paper cells containing paper fibres form fibre clusters, which are connected by fibre bundles, and the transport of ink and water takes place between the fibre clusters through the fibre bundles.</p><p>*e first one-dimensional brush depiction models were proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>, where a brush is defined as a one-dimensional array of brush hairs; in a method based on the contour of a brush path <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>, the path is described as a number of continuous Bezier or B-spline curves. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> modeled the brush as consisting of a number of bristles randomly distributed over a circular area, with each bristles drawing a separate curve as the brush moves, and all the curves together forming a single stroke. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> illustrates the principle of the generation of the black edge phenomenon in ink painting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> proposed an automatic cell-based computational model to simulate the movement of water and ink particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> used a fluctuation rule to represent the flow of ink particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref> proposed a water absorption force balance algorithm to calculate the diffusion amount of adjacent paper cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> proposed a pseudo-Brownian motion method based on a particle system to simulate the diffusion process, taking into account the effects of water absorption, humidity, evaporation rate, and background texture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> complemented the algorithm by proposing an exchange threshold value as an exchange condition and an exchange rate to control the amount of exchange. However both values are static in the diffusion process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref> used a local equilibrium model and a three-layer paper model to simulate the effect of ink diffusion. *is method can simulate simple stacking effects, and Young gave a graph of the stacking effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref> proposed a diffusion model with concentration difference as the driving force for diffusion, but did not present a theoretical basis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> proposed to simulate the diffusion of ink particles with Fick's first law of steady-state diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>, but in reality the diffusion process is a nonsteady-state process, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32]</ref> proposed to use a fluid based on LBE (Lattice Boltzmann Equation) to simulate ink diffusion. *e diffusion model is easy to parallelize, has good real-time performance, and can produce very realistic ink and wash wet brush painting effects. However, by treating both water and ink particles as equally sized particles, the particle diffusion model is not a true particularised model, but simply a diffusion model under the rule of concentration correspondence. *is method does not allow for differences in the diffusion of multiple pigments.</p><p>As can be seen, KM colour models have been chosen to solve the problem of colour setting, both in colour simulation for Western painting and in colour setting for ink painting. *e problem of colour calculation is complicated by the diffusion of pigments in ink painting, especially when multiple pigments are diffused together. How to apply the KM colour model's superimposition and mixing formulae through layering based on the characteristics of diffusion is one of the main focuses of this paper. Based on the second type of method, this paper proposes an ink rendering algorithm based on two-dimensional texture mapping, which can simulate the traditional ink painting technique of intensity and distance. *is paper uses attribute functions to control the huge changes in the vertical component of ink textures to simulate the shadow and distance techniques of ink painting. Compared with the existing algorithms, the 2D texture mapping of the attribute function provides richer rendering effects. In the ink rendering of the 3D scene, the effects of light and shade and distance are added, which makes the image more layered and closer to the painter's painting skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Principle of the Algorithm</head><p>*e main objective of the algorithm in this paper is to achieve a simulation of the intensity and distance technique while obtaining a traditional ink and wash rendering. *e difference from traditional 3D ink rendering is the inclusion of the processing and use of 3D depth information. By constructing an attribute function with the 3D depth information as the independent variable for texture mapping, and then controlling the colour tones of the textures to express the changes in the 3D depth information, the effect can be obtained in terms of the intensity of the ink strokes in the near distance and the lightness of the strokes in the far distance. *is idea is based on traditional cartoon rendering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> and the X-TOON system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Bella developed the X-TOON system based on the traditional cartoon rendering algorithm, which extends the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>1D cartoon texture to a 2D texture, using the vertical component of the texture to express the colour tone changes and then controlling the texture mapping to obtain a richer cartoon effect. *is paper uses the X-TOON systematic approach to produce two-dimensional ink textures. *e hue of the horizontal component of the texture (first dimension) is associated with the model contour edge information, and the texture coordinates are controlled by calculating N-V, where N is the unit normal vector of the spatial surface and V is the unit vector of view. *e vertical component of the texture (second dimension) is associated with the colour hue (represented in the article by the attribute function D), and the texture coordinates are controlled by the attribute function D. Each value in the vertical component is associated with its own 1D ink texture, so the whole 2D texture can be seen as a superposition of 1D ink textures of progressively increasing hue. *e ink texture generate is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Chafing Renderer.</head><p>*ere is a wide variety of shops in ink and wash work, and the differences in expression between the various crops are large, while the painter is more spontaneous in using this technique it is not possible to propose an algorithm for each of these techniques. It is therefore not possible to propose an algorithm for each chap. *e texture map is then drawn based on a two-step texture mapping method. *e regularised chunking set has been obtained after chunking feature analysis S texture k � s i | i � 1, 2, 3, . . . 􏼈 􏼉 1itexturek first determines the number of interpolated textures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">S-O Two-</head><p>Step Texture Mapping. To optimise the rendering results, the S-O two-step texture mapping method is used to chisel the model. *is method was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. *e basic idea is that instead of directly texturing the 3D model surface, an intermediate transition surface is introduced and the mapping process is decomposed into a twostep operation: the first step is the mapping from the textured plane to the transition surface, i.e., T(u, v) ⟶ S(x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ), which becomes the S mapping; the first step is the mapping from the transition surface to the 3D model surface, i.e., S(x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ) ⟶ O(x, y, z), which becomes the O mapping. *e transition surfaces in S mapping are usually simple 3D surfaces such as spheres, cylinders, and cubes, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p><p>*ere are 12 combinations of S-mapping and O-mapping. In this paper, we take a spherical surface as the transition surface for S-mapping and modify the third Omapping method for chaffing. *e sphere of the transition surface is divided into two parts symmetrical along the x-plane, and the texture is mapped to the two parts symmetrical to the sphere using a mapping algorithm with an area-equivalence constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>. As in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, gave a 2D texture coordinate system ], the centre of the texture plane coincides with the origin of the coordinate system at any point p(u, v) , which can be expressed in polar coordinates (p, α). Given a three-dimensional coordinate system x, y, z, the centre of a spherical planet of radius R coincides with the origin, and any point Q (x, y, x) on the spherical plane is expressed in spherical coordinates as (R, y). Due to the symmetry, the sphere can be divided into two hemispheres by the xy plane, and the mapping method is the same in both hemispheres.</p><p>Let a point P on the texture plane be mapped to a point on the hemisphere. In order to effectively reduce texture distortion, an area-equivalence constraint Q <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> is used here to construct the mapping relationship between the two points. *e area equiproportionality constraint, i.e., the ratio of the area of the texture plane to the area of the corresponding mapped area on the sphere is transversely equal to the constant K:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K � π • ρ 2 2πR 2 (1 -cos ϕ) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>3.1. Drawing Model Shapes. In ink painting, when the artist uses ink to paint a scene, it often spreads and soaks through the rice paper, giving the brushstrokes that depict the outline of the object in a certain area. For this reason, instead of extracting single-pixel contour lines from the model, the shape of the model is outlined by mapping the texture around the contour lines to a certain area. *e simulation process is implemented in the OpenGL shading language. In the vertex shading, the absolute value a of the dot product of the unit normal and the unit apparently vector is calculated separately for each vertex, and a is passed to the pixel shading as a mutable variable. In the pixel shading, an is used to control the texture coordinates of the horizontal component of the texture. In order to achieve the effect of white space in an ink painting, a threshold λ can be set so that when a&gt;λ, the pixels of the slice are set to the colour of the white space in the ink texture. *e larger value of the threshold λ, the smaller the white area. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the rendering effect on a fixed vertical component texture coordinates. With λ values of 0.5 in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) and 0.7 in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Control of Colour Tone</head><p>Information. *is step performs the texture mapping of the vertical component and is the heart of the algorithm. In order to simulate the fade technique, elements closer to the point of view are assigned textures with stronger tone. In contrast, elements that are further away from the viewpoint are assigned lighter textures.</p><p>To do this, an attribute function is designed for the vertical component texture mapping, starting with the depth information in 3D space as the independent variable. For the selection of depth information, two methods can be used: (i) the Euclidean distance from the 3D point to the viewpoint is used as the depth information (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>second calculation method was found to be better for simulating the effect of ink and wash painting in terms of intensity and distance.</p><p>For the attribute function D, the following constraints are imposed: ① the range of D is between 0 and 1, thus corresponding to the range of texture coordinates; ② set the threshold d min , when the distance from the point on the model to the viewpoint is less than or equal to d min , the value of D is 1, and when the distance is greater d min , the value of D gradually decreases; ③ set the threshold d max � r × d min , when the distance from the model point to the viewpoint is equal to when the distance from the model point to the viewpoint is equal to d max , the value of D is 0, where the value of r is greater than 1.</p><p>Different types of functions can be constructed to meet the above requirements. Line attribute functions, quadratic attribute functions, and attribute functions that take into account the effects of illumination are designed to simulate the ink effect in 3D models. *e simplest method is to use linear property functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D � 1, d ≤ d min , D � 1 (1 -r) × d min × d + r/(1 -r) 􏼁 , d ≥ d min , ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where d is the current depth property value of the 3D point and r and d min are adjustable parameters. In the slice shader, the result is calculated as the coordinate value of the vertical component of the ink texture, and the function value decreases linearly when the current depth value of the model exceeds the threshold d min . Using the point of view as a reference, the larger vertical component texture coordinates are taken in the near area, corresponding to the darker tones  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Diffusion Processes</head><p>. *e special feature of ink painting is that the brush bristles contain a large amount of water, and the pigment diffuses within the rice paper by the action of the water. *e study of diffusion is indispensable in order to fundamentally simulate the effect of drawing ink paintings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> proposes to analyse ink and wash from the viewpoint of      superimpositions are limited to two aspects: first, particlebased diffusion has been proposed, but none of them are particle-based diffusion in the true sense. Second, they are limited to the diffusion of a single ink particle and do not include the diffusion of all the essential properties of the various pigments. *ird, there is no in-depth study of the reality of the superposition of different pigments.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>In the experiments, the equations were verified separately as property functions, and the same parameters and sampling points were set for both experiments in order to compare the two. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> shows the effect of linking with increasing values of depth d. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11(a)</ref> shows the effect when d &lt; d min , which is closer to the point of view and the ink is thicker; 11(b) and 11(c) show the effect when d &gt; d min and d is gradually increased, which shows that the ink is getting lighter. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref> shows a comparison between the traditional ink simulation without the depth attribute function, the ink simulation with the linear attribute function and the ink simulation with the quadratic attribute function when drawing the mountain model, with the parameter d min at 100 and r at 10. *e traditional 3D ink rendering algorithm does not consider the effect of the depth attribute on the rendering effect, so no matter how the depth value of the model vertices is changed, it is difficult to produce a strong or light. *e results obtained by the algorithm in this paper vary with the depth value, as shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12(b</ref>) and 12(c), with a stronger sense of hierarchy using the secondary attribute function. *e reason for the different degrees of intensity is the variation in the value of the attribute function.</p><p>From the experimental results, it can be seen that the algorithm of this paper can be used to simulate the technique of intensity and distance better, and by changing the attribute function model and the relevant parameters of the function, the rendering effect with different contrast of intensity and distance can be obtained, which is a simple and practical method and provides an effective way for the 3D ink rendering of large-scale scenes.</p><p>Other attempts have been made to apply the attribute function. In artwork, there is often a technique of detail abstraction, where the details of something are detailed in the near distance, and only the general outline is drawn in the far distance, while the internal details are sketchy or not even portrayed. It is worth noting that the detail abstraction simulation here is different from the LOD technique, which only uses property functions and texture mapping techniques to obtain a sensory abstraction effect, without any processing of the 3D model mesh.</p><p>*e traditional pencil drawing simulation requires a set of pencil drawing textures, and then uses the lighting function to control the weight of the different textures, and finally mixes the textures. *e depth value is also taken into account, and the depth value is calculated by adding a white texture to the original pencil texture, and then using a linear property function to control the weighting factor of the texture, the final result is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13</ref>. It can be seen that the method can be used to simulate a detailed abstraction technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Drawing Effect.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">14</ref> shows work by Qi Baishi when he was 80 years old, which mainly uses the technique of writing, using the intensity of ink colour to represent the object. From the experimental results, it can be seen that for different styles of input work, the algorithm is able to pass the basic stylistic features to the 3D model and render the ink accordingly, resulting in output images of similar styles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>*e paper uses attribute functions to control the huge changes of the vertical components of the ink textures to simulate the ink painting technique of shade and distance. Compared with the existing algorithms, the 2D texture mapping by the attribute function provides a richer rendering effect, and in the ink rendering of 3D scenes, the addition of the effect of shade and distance makes the image more layered and closer to the painter's painting technique.</p><p>In order to provide a richer surface detail of the 3D model, the radial curvature of the model surface can be calculated, which is one of the directions for the future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :Figure 1 :</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Synthetic results after image interpolation.
