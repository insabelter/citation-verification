<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Genetic diversity research is required to understand the conservation and management of plant resources in all ecosystems. In Iran, there are 15 different Erodium species. Erodium genetic diversity has not been studied extensively using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). As a result, six species were gathered and learned from six different Iranian locales. A total of 82 plant specimens were collected. Our objectives were to assess Erodium species genetic diversity and to identify Erodium species genetic diversity. 2) Is there a link between a species's genetic makeup and geographic location? 3) Population and taxon genetic structure. Erodium species were separated into two groups using an unweighted pair group technique with arithmetic mean and principal component analysis. In Erodium, gene flow (Nm) was relatively modest (0.33). The Mantel test revealed a link between genetic and geographical distances (r = 0.77, p=0.0001). We identified many genetic variations in the Erodium species, which indicates that it can adapt to changing circumstances. According to recent findings, RAPD markers and morphometry approaches may investigate Erodium species genetic diversity.</p></div>

Irano-Touranian and Saharo-Sindian components make up the majority of these species. The Hyrcanian area is home to just one species <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(JANIGHORBAN, 2009)</ref>. Erodium species grow in various settings, from annuals (25 species) to perennials. In the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>Geraniaceae, there are two forms of leaf venation: palmate and pinnate. Except for California and Geranium, which are palmate, Erodium species vary from subpinnate to pinnate. Pinnatifid, pinnatipartite, and pinnatisect are the three forms of leaf division <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(FIZ et al., 2006)</ref>. In all Erodium species, the androecium has five fertile stamens and five staminodia, but only five fertile stamens in California. In comparison, Monsonia's androecium (15 fertile stamens) and Geranium's androecium (15 fertile stamens) have less fertile stamens (10 fertile stamens). Pollen from the Geraniaceae family has four unique ornamentation styles based on supratectal features and tectum morphology. Striate pollen was found in 68 of the 74 Erodium species identified in the four subclades <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(FIZ et al., 2006)</ref>. The three varieties of Erodium species are based on the surface ornamentation of the mericarp body: smooth (3), papillate (70), and foveate fruit (1). Annuals are often autogamous, actinomorphic, and lack attractive features, while perennials are allogamous, have zygomorphic blooms, and have exceptional floral architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(ALDASORO et al., 2000)</ref>. Drought adaptation in the Mediterranean during the late Tertiary may have resulted in changes in growth morphology <ref type="bibr">(BAKKER et al., 1955)</ref>. Annuals and species that establish themselves in transient or disturbed environments are prone to selfing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(BAKER, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">STEBBINS, 1957)</ref>. Most Erodium's 22 selfers have large distribution regions, indicating that they may spread and establish themselves via these reproductive traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(STEBBINS, 1957)</ref>. The use of RAPD markers to acquire information on genetic diversity within and among populations of E. paularense was described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">MARTIN et al. (1997)</ref>. The Erodium subsect phylogeny. ALARCN et al. study Petraea, a morphologically and genetically related group of six species from the western Mediterranean Alps (2012). Due to sequence similarities, the combined trnL-F-ITS analysis could not establish the evolutionary relationships between these taxa. Molecular markers are often used in genetic diversity research. Molecular markers are a powerful tool for identifying evolutionary links between species and populations. RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) is a sensitive genetic technique or marker for detecting individual variation in a species <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(MA et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">PENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">SI et al., 2021)</ref> The RAPD approach is low-cost and may be used for small sample sets. RAPD may also amplify and target attractive genetic regions and markers <ref type="bibr">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018c;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018d;</ref><ref type="bibr">YIN et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In the past, taxonomic systematics investigations were used to identify Erodium species. To the best of our knowledge, no RAPD data on genetic diversity research has been found in Iran. We looked at 82 different samples. Our objectives were to 1) determine the genetic diversity of Erodium species and 2) determine the genetic diversity of Erodium species.</p><p>2) Is there a link between species and distance from home? 3) Population and taxon genetic structure 4) Is it possible for Erodium species to share genes?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant materials</head><p>Six Erodium species have been detected in Iran in various locations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). These species were studied using molecular methods. The random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis process used a total of 82 samples. All species were recognized using primary sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(BAKER, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">STEBBINS, 1957)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C</head><p>T E D Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Fresh leaves were used to obtain DNA. Before being utilized, the leaves had been dried. The DNA extraction procedure was followed just as previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(ESFANDANI-BOZCHALOYI et al., 2019)</ref>. An agarose gel was used to test the DNA purity. RAPD primers amplify the DNA (Operon technology, Alameda, Canada). These primers were from OPA, OPB, OPC, and OPD primer sets. Six primers were selected based on their ability to produce distinct bands and polymorphisms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species Identification and Genetic Diversity</head><p>Plant DNA (Erodium species) may be amplified using the primers OPB-01-02 and OPD-02-08 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We produced and amplified 77 polymorphic bands. The items were amplified between 100 and 3000 times their original volume. In OPD-08, we detected the most polymorphic bands. The polymorphic bands in OPB-02 were the smallest. Each primer included an average of 13 polymorphic bands. The samples' polymorphic information content (PIC)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R E T R A C</formula><p>T E D ranged from 0.29 to 0.69 (OPA-05) (OPB-02). The average polymorphism information content of primers was 0.47. MI values ranged from 2.22 (OPB-01) to 4.45 (OPD-02), with an average of 3.5 for each primer. Deals of the effective multiplex ratio (EMR) are essential for distinguishing genotypes. EMR values ranged from 6.34 (OPB-02) to 11.44 (OPD-02) in our research. EMR readings per primer were 8.3 on average (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The genetic traits of six Erodium species have been computed and are shown (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Unbiased anticipated heterozygozygosity (UHe) in E. hoefftianum was in the range of 0.13. A 0.34 was found in E. neuradifolium. In the Erodium species as a whole, UHe value heterozygosity had a mean value of 0.22. In E. neuradifolium, Shannon information was high (0.266). The lowest value, 0.14, was found in E. hoefftianum. Shannon's information had a mean value of 0.21. In E. gruinum and E. neuradifolium, the observed number of alleles (Na) varied from 0.31 to 0.422. For E. glaucophyllum and E. neuradifolium, the adequate number of alleles (Ne) ranged between 1.012-1.133.</p><p>The AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) test was used to find genetic variations between Erodium species (P = 0.001). According to AMOVA, 60% of genetic variation occurs across species. There was significantly less variety within the species (40 percent). Genetic similarity and dissimilarity, as evaluated by Genetic statistics (GST), had Dest values of (0.155, P = 0.001) and (0.155, P = 0.001), respectively, indicating considerable disparities.</p><p>Because the results of several clustering and ordination techniques were identical, UPGMA clustering is presented here (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Plant samples from each species's specific area were grouped and formed separate clusters in general (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The molecular traits analyzed in this research seem to separate Erodium species into two distinct sets or groupings. We didn't find any transitional forms among the specimens we looked at. The UPGMA tree (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) yielded two large clusters, with populations of E. glaucophyllum, E. neuradifolium, and E. moschatum grouped in the first and separated by a significant distance from the other species in the second. Two sub-clusters made up the second central cluster. The first sub-cluster consisted of E. gruinum plants, whereas the second sub-cluster consisted of E. malacoides and E. hoefftianum plants.  In Erodium species, gene flow (Nm) was shallow (0.33). Erodium members' genetic identity and phylogenetic distance are investigated. E. hoefftianum and E. malacoides were genetically related (0.83). Due to their minimal genetic resemblance, E. moschatum and E.</p></div>

The mantel test revealed a link between genetic and geographical distances (r = 0.77, p=0.0001). The Evanno test yielded K = 6 (Figure not included) and indicated the Erodium species' genetic characteristics. According to STRUCTURE research, E. hoefftianum and E. malacoides are closely connected to common alleles. Due to diverse allelic structures, the remaining Erodium species are genetically distinct. A similar effect was seen on the plot next door. K-Means and STRUCTURE studies backed up the limited gene flow findings. We found no evidence of significant gene exchange between Erodium species. Because these populations were near one another, this result corresponds to the grouping we found using UPGMA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). According to the STRUCTURE plot based on the admixture model, these common alleles make up a minuscule proportion of the genomes in diverse populations. These data suggest a high degree of genetic stratification among Erodium groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Erodium is a taxonomic category having several morphological traits that make it challenging to identify and categorize Erodium species <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(FIZ et al., 2006)</ref>. Other techniques to improve the central taxonomic methodology must be investigated because of the complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(ERBANO et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZOU et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">JI et al., 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr">JI et al., , 2020b;;</ref><ref type="bibr">JIA et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHENG et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZHU et al., 2021)</ref>. Plant taxonomists may now use molecular techniques to explore plant groupings thanks to advances in molecular technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(ERBANO et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">SALARI et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">SALARI et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">BI et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">CHENG et al., 2021)</ref>. Molecular approaches were used to look at the genetic diversity of Erodium species. To study genetic diversity and genetic affinity in Erodium species, we mainly employed RAPD markers. Similar patterns emerged from our grouping and ordination techniques.</p><p>For the first time, genetic diversity in six Erodium species groups is described in this work. This research aimed to identify diagnostic traits that may be used to distinguish Erodium species in Iran. PIC values (polymorphic information content) help detect genetic diversity. The average PIC values in this investigation were 0.42. This number is adequate for evaluating population genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(KEMPF et al., 2016)</ref>. According to the current research, the Erodium population contains a lot of genetic variabilities. STRUCTURE genomic research and molecular variance analysis revealed genetic variations between the two species.</p><p>Surprisingly, STRUCTURE research revealed that Erodium species had common alleles. Self-pollination is linked to common alleles in Erodium <ref type="bibr">(WILLIAMS et al., 2000)</ref>. According to the available data; hence, reporting minimal gene flow is reasonable. When utilizing RAPD markers, gene flow values were similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(MARTIN et al., 1997)</ref>. Reduced gene exchange among Erodium species and populations might potentially be attributed to physical isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(FISCHER et al., 2000)</ref>. According to the Mantel test findings, there was little or no gene flow. The Mantel test found a strong link between genetic and geographical distances. As a result, the genetic structure of the Erodium population is determined by gene limitation and separation by distance. The use of RAPD markers to acquire information on genetic diversity within and among people of E. paularense was described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">MARTIN et al. (1997)</ref>. ALARCN et al. study the phylogeny of the Erodium subsect. Petraea, a morphologically and genetically related group of six species from the western Mediterranean Alps (2012). Due to sequence similarities,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>the combined trnL-F-ITS analysis could not establish the evolutionary relationships between these taxa. Different populations clustered into six closely related phylogroups that were somewhat associated with morphological species, according to AFLP fragment analysis. For the first time, phylogenetic reconstructions in the Mediterranean genus Erodium are carried out using two matrices: one with 96 Erodium trnL-trnF sequences plus 23 morphological characters, and the other with 96 Erodium trnL-trnF sequences plus 23 morphological characters, using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(FIZ et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Based on a trnLtrnF investigation of 95 Geraniaceae accessions and combined data analysis, their findings showed that Erodium and California are monophyletic. The genetic diversity and population structure of Erodium species were investigated using molecular markers (RAPD). There were genetic differences among all of the species. According to the current findings, isolation and restricted gene flow are the vital deterministic traits that define the Erodium population. We also discovered that the Erodium species has a lot of genetic diversity, suggesting that it can adapt to changing environments since genetic diversity is connected to species adaptability.</p></div>

Akademija stočarstva i veterine, Qinghai Univerzitet, Xining, Qinghai, 810016, Kina 3 Department za poljoprivredu, Payamee Noor Univerzitet (PNU), Tehran, Iran Izvod Studije genetičke raznovrsnosti su od suštinskog značaja za razumevanje očuvanja i upravljanja biljnim resursima u bilo kom okruženju. U Iranu je prijavljeno 15 vrsta Erodium. Nisu sprovedena detaljna RAPD proučavanja da bi se proučavala genetska raznolikost Erodium vrste. Stoga smo prikupili i analizirali šest vrsta iz šest provincija Irana. Ukupno su prikupljena 82 primerka biljaka. Naši ciljevi su bili: 1) da procenimo genetičku raznovrsnost među vrstama Erodium 2) da utvrdimo da li postoji korelacija između genetske i geografske udaljenosti vrsta? 3) da se utvrdi genetička struktura populacija i taksona. Metoda grupe neponderisanih parova sa analizom aritmetičke sredine i glavne komponente podelila je vrste Erodium u dve grupe. Protok gena (Nm) je bio relativno nizak (0,33). Mantelov test je pokazao korelaciju (r = 0,77, p=0,0001) između genetičke i geografske udaljenosti. Prijavili smo visoku genetsku raznovrsnost, što jasno pokazuje da se vrste Erodium mogu prilagoditi promenljivim sredinama jer je visoka genetska raznolikost povezana sa prilagodljivošću vrsta. Sadašnji rezultati su istakli korisnost RAPD markera i metoda morfometrije za istraživanje genetske raznolikosti vrsta Erodium.</figDesc><table><row><cell>POREĐENJE INDIVIDUALNIH PRISTUPA KORIŠĆENJEM RAPD MARKERA ZA</cell></row><row><cell>IDENTIFIKACIJU GENETSKIH VEZA U Erodium (Geranaiceae)</cell></row><row><cell>ZHENG, R., S., ZHAO, M., KHAYATNEZHAD, S., AFZAL SHAH (2021): Comparative study and genetic diversity in Salvia (Lamiaceae) using RAPD Molecular Markers.
