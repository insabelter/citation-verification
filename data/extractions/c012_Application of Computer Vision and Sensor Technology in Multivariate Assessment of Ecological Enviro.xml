<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Environmental issues are global issues in the 21st century. Environmental planning is a reasonable arrangement of space and time for human activities and the environment to make the environment, economy, and society develop in a coordinated manner <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Ecological environment planning is an important way to achieve the coordinated development of society, economy, and environment. *e idea of the modern ecocity directly originated from Edward Howard's garden city <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. *e theory of the garden city shows people the ecological charm of the balance between city and nature. Since the 1960s, the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, and France have taken a series of actions in environmental planning management, established environmental planning committees, and designated and implemented national, state, and urban environmental planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. *e timely development of eco-environmental planning has timely alleviated the contradiction between the economy and environment. However, the research and solution of environmental problems must involve complex and open information systems. Computer information technology combines modern theories and methods in the development of environmental protection with computers. It has strong spatial and attribute analysis capabilities and can provide convenient and accurate data management and analysis means for the research of ecological environmental protection planning. *erefore, the combination of computer information technology and environmental science has great development potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Solving the problem of ecological environment monitoring is a major event related to urban environmental protection and people's health <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. We must do a good job in ecological environment monitoring, strengthen applied</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E T R A C T E D</head><p>research on ecological environment monitoring, protect the urban ecological environment, and promote sustainable urban development. Modern ecological environmental monitoring has diversity and complexity. With the help of Internet of *ings technology, the scientific and technological content of ecological environmental monitoring can be improved, and the efficiency of ecological environment monitoring can be improved. At the same time, it can relatively reduce the detection pressure of environmental monitoring personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</p><p>At present, with the development of the national economy, the public has higher and higher requirements for the living environment. *e living environment level is mainly composed of the ecological environment and manmade environment. Among them, the man-made environment is controllable, but the ecological environment is uncontrollable. *erefore, to improve the living environment level, the protection of the ecological environment is particularly critical <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. *e function of the ecological environment monitoring system is to monitor the ecological environment status of each region, provide key analysis data for the protection of the ecological environment, and promote the sustainable development of the ecological environment. *e traditional ecological environment monitoring system has a poor ability to identify potential ecological environment change factors and is not forwardlooking, which makes some ecological environments unable to be treated and protected in time, resulting in irreparable losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. *erefore, based on the traditional monitoring system, this study integrates RS technology and GIS positioning technology and takes the development needs of the field of ecological environment management as the core to build a new ecological environment monitoring system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>In recent years, the rapid development of computer information technology has added new blood to the traditional ecological planning theories and methods. It makes the ecological planning system expressed in the form of numbers and tables and provides convenience for information acquisition, data analysis, and scheme formulation of ecological planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. Haruna and others proposed the application of remote sensing, GIS technology, and software engineering in ecological planning. Later, with the deepening of computer information technology in urban planning, architectural design, and other spatial environment design fields, GIS and virtual reality (VR) technology began to be applied in urban construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Liu and others systematically integrated the most advanced GIS and VR platforms in the world based on the urban planning and design method of GIS and VR technology, highlighted the applicability, served the production projects, greatly improved the quality and efficiency of urban planning and design, introduced virtual scenes into urban planning, visually and intuitively, generated data in urban planning, and provided conditions for the future implementation of urban planning and computer urban planning information management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Yakubova and others used VR, GIS, WWW, and other information technologies to digitally collect and store, dynamically monitor and process, comprehensively manage, and transmit and distribute various information such as geographical environment, infrastructure, natural resources, ecological environment, population distribution, social and economic status in the study area. Build a threedimensional urban model and urban basic information platform and establish a professional application rule base, model base, and corresponding application system suitable for different functional departments. On this basis, develop a computer application system for governments at all levels to comprehensively manage cities and make macro decisions and use digital technology for ecological planning, changing the concept of planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Mai and others proposed the Yellow River Basin water based on the spatial data collection, editing, management, analysis, and mapping system, which directly provides the government departments with the query of the background data of the ecological environment and reflects the change trend and law of the ecological environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Alharthi and others used RS and GIS technology, took the TM satellite remote sensing image of the study area as the main data source, combined with the social and economic data and field investigation records of the study area in recent years, conducted scenario simulation on the ecological environment of the study area, and used envi4.5 as a supporting tool to guide the development planning and ecological construction of the study area by exploring the dominant resources and contradictions in land use <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Khashaba and others aimed to realize dynamic monitoring and information management of the ecological environment in the research of the ecological environment information management system based on WebGIS. Based on the investigation of basic ecological environment data and the establishment of a massive spatial database, WebGIS technology is seamlessly integrated with traditional mls/oa, and the integrated "3S" technology is used to realize the management of massive ecological environment resource data in the planning area <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. *rough the extraction and mining of "3S" thematic information, it preliminarily provides auxiliary decision support for ecological environment planning and management.</p></div>

At the same time, the memory immediately clears up the buffer data and invalid data stored in the space and then transfers the data in the slot to the memory. *e task of the memory is to store the ecological environment data for the monitoring system and call the previous environment data during monitoring, so as to simplify the monitoring process. Each storage space of the memory has a read-write function. Is memory module is set for storage, and the ecological environment data deleted in a certain period can be retrieved. *e read/write storage speed of the 8051 core memory can reach 2045 mb/s, which is also scalable. It can be additionally equipped with two d × 517 hard disks to expand the original 4 GB DDR4 to 32 GB, so as to improve the storage speed and call the speed of the memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Software Design of the Ecological Environment Monitoring</head><p>System Based on RS and GIS. Remote sensing technology is based on electromagnetic wave theory. It uses a variety of card readers and sensors to identify electromagnetic waves within a certain distance and processes the collected data, so as to affect the ecological environment, apply it to different fields, and solve different problems. Remote sensing technology is used to collect data on a certain space area, simulate its environmental status, and assist ecological environment monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. *e basic principle of applying remote sensing image main analysis technology to ecological environment monitoring is to use the remote sensing effect to classify the ecological environment and then monitor according to the data of various ecological environment indicators. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the RS technical idea. When monitoring the ecological environment, the principal component analysis technology of remote sensing images is used to determine the ecological environment level according to the remote sensing ecological environment indicators. *e principal component analysis of remote sensing images was used to monitor the ecological environment of air quality and soil dryness. Its eco-environmental indicators include ground humidity, air humidity, ground temperature, and green plant coverage. Using remote sensing technology for monitoring, first, collect the above ecological environment indicators, normalize the collected data, and calculate the correlation matrix of each indicator. *e monitoring system automatically simulates the regional ecological environment and analyzes the ecological environment level of the region in combination with the geographic location information detected by GIS technology. *e specific normalization calculation formula is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">RSE � 1 -PCl[a, b, c, d, e)] { }, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">D � RSE -RSE OMIN 􏼁 RSE 0MAX -RSE 0MIN 􏼁 , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where a is the soil moisture; b represents air quality; c represents the air humidity component; d is the surface temperature; e refers to green plant coverage. *e fluctuation range of the normalized value is between 0 and 1. *e closer the value is to 1, the better the ecological environment is. On the contrary, the worse the ecological environment is.</p><p>GIS is also called geographic information technology. *e task of this technology is to integrate information science and geographic science. It is a comprehensive geographic information technology based on cybernetics, information theory, artificial intelligence, spatial analysis, and other disciplines. It is used to collect data related to geographic information. With the development of the network field, the biggest advantage of geographic information technology in the field of ecological environment monitoring is visualization and real-time, which makes the results of ecological environment monitoring highly accurate. *e principle of geographic information monitoring is to call the geographic information of the area to be monitored in the geographic information system through the network to provide the analysis data basis for the identification of the ecological environment level and then combine the regional ecological environment simulation imaging formed by GIS technology to carry out a visual geospatial analysis. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the implementation path of GIS technology.</p><p>In the ecological environment monitoring system, the main work of GIS technology is to collect, analyze, and monitor the geographical information of the monitoring environment and the surrounding area. Once there is a fluctuation in the geographical area within the monitoring area that can affect the monitoring area, GIS technology will identify it for the first time and make countermeasures to maintain the development of the ecological environment.</p><p>Based on the performance analysis of the equipment in the hardware area of the ecological environment monitoring system and the analysis and discussion of the monitoring principle of RS technology and GIS technology, this study summarizes the workflow of the ecological environment monitoring system based on RS technology and GIS technology. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the specific work steps.</p></div>
