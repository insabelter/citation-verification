However, the observed differences were eliminated after adjustment for confounders (history of cardiac ischemia was 1.8 times more likely in the sevoflurane group)  [47] . The second study analyzed 325 patients with 173 in the propofol group and 152 in the sevoflurane group. No difference was observed in the overall 5-year survival rate between two groups, although the propofol group did have a lower rate of cancer recurrence (p = 0.037)  [48] . The third study collected 2645 cases, which included 2589 in the volatile anesthesia group and 56 in the propofol group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative recurrence or survival probability  [49] . Taken together, these studies suggest that propofol may either improve overall survival rates or lower the rate of cancer recurrence, but the evidence is not overwhelming. It is good to consider the limitations of these studies. First, there is the inherent limitation of retrospective studies in that they

Pro-tumor effects
In 2002, Garib et al. observed that propofol (3-9 μg/mL) increased migration of MDA-MB-468 cells  [24] . They also found that propofol increased intracellular calcium and altered the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of these cells  [25] . These effects of propofol were inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. The group tested the hypothesis that propofol was acting via GABA-A receptor chloride channels. Although they found evidence for the gamma subunit of the GABA-A receptor and the effect of propofol was inhibited by the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline, they did not provide evidence for functional channels in the cells. It should be noted that bicuculline is not specific for GABA-A receptor channels; it is also known to block small conductance Ca ++ -activated K
- GABA-A receptor channels; it is also known to block small conductance Ca ++ -activated K + channels at similar concentrations  [26] . In a recent study, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with propofol (2-10 μg/mL) for up to 12 h was shown to increase cell proliferation and migration. The functional changes in the cells were correlated with an increase in nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) expression level, and a decrease in p53 expression level, caspase-3 activity and percentage of apoptotic cells  [27] . In summary, most studies conclude that propofol suppresses cancer cell viability and migration (Table  1 ). Some results are inconsistent with this though. The potential mechanism of pro-tumor effects is summarized in Fig.  2 . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the heterogeneity of breast cancer: propofol may have different actions on different cancer cell types. Another factor is non-standardization of experimental parameters such as the concentration and time of exposure to anesthetic. So far, there are few insights into the mechanism of action of propofol. Propofol has been identified to modulate HIF-1α pathway in prostate cancer

- Introduction
Insect pollination is a key ecological interaction, involved in the reproduction of more than 80% of angiosperms  [1]  and about 75% of world crop production  [2] . Until recently, most of the studies addressing the role of insects as pollinators focused on bees, but the awareness of the collapse of their populations has sparked a growing interest in other flower-visiting insects (non-bee Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera) as potential pollinators  [3] . However even in agricultural landscapes, where wild insects have proven efficient pollinators by increasing fruit set independently of honeybees' abundance  [4] , studies measuring pollination effectiveness of non-bee flower-visiting insects are very scarce. Consequently, despite the proliferating new knowledge on flower-visitor networks, the actual role played by most anthophilous insects in the pollination of flowering plants remains largely unknown. Flies (Diptera) represent the most conspicuous group of flower-visitors and potential pollinators after bees  [5] [6] [7] , especially in cool to cold habitats of high altitude or latitude where wild bees become naturally scarcer
- obligate floral-visitors with more than 2000 described species worldwide which, contrary to the commonly accepted assumptions that they are generalists and poor pollinators, could reveal high levels of specialization and the same pollination efficiency as bees. Their high abundance and diversity throughout the favourable season suggest that they are important pollinators in mountains and at high latitudes  [14] . Like empidine dance flies, numerous species of calliphorids, conopids, muscids, anthomyids, tabanids and many other fly families depend on nectar and pollen for feeding. In habitats where bees are unable to thrive, flies often represent the predominant biotic vector carrying pollen grains from one flower to another, and therefore the main potential pollinators.

- , especially in cool to cold habitats of high altitude or latitude where wild bees become naturally scarcer  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, most studies including dipterans address only flower visitation frequencies, which King et al.  [15]  consider a poor proxy for pollinator effectiveness. Visitors are indeed not always pollinators, a visit being likely to enhance the reproductive success of a plant only when it results in conspecific pollen deposition on its stigma. Therefore, direct measures of pollinator effectiveness and plant reproductive success should be performed, respectively, through single-visit stigmatic pollen deposition and seed set after single-visit experiments  [16, 17] . To our knowledge, very few studies include such experiments on flower-visiting Diptera, although some of them challenge the common assumption that bees are the best pollinators: e.g. hoverflies can pollinate strawberries as efficiently as bees  [18] , and a blowfly (Calliphoridae) was shown to be as efficient as honeybees and other flower-visitors together in pollinating hybrid carrots  [19] . Moreover, the first study comparing syrphids with other Diptera

The antioxidant system in most drug-resistant cancer cells is complicated.  29  Sorafenib, as a multi-kinase inhibitor, may regulate redox homeostasis in drug-resistant cancer cells. Thus, we monitored the redox balance between biological redox couples, such as GSH/GSSG, NADPH/NADP, and NAD/NADH in parental and resistant cells. In general, compared with parental cell lines, a relative reductive state was found in resistant cell lines (Fig.  2g ). Interestingly, NADH/NAD+ in HepG2 cells and NADPH/NADP+ in SK-Hep-1 cells showed inconsistent trends, indicating a general reductive but cell line-specific redox homeostasis in sorafenib resistance. Taken together, these results indicate that resistant cells retain better mitochondrial function and integrity with less mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity, resulting in reduced ROS production in response to sorafenib treatment and sustained sorafenib resistance.

- inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation in sorafenib-resistant cells Cells have developed finely tuned and complex mechanisms to adapt to stress conditions and metabolic demand alterations by modulating mitochondrial number and function.  30  Mitochondria and cellular homeostasis are accurately coordinated by mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the reduced mitochondrial content in resistant cells, we first evaluated mitochondria degradation. Mitophagy is a principle mechanism for mitochondria degradation and reduction of ROS stress.  31  We measured mitophagy levels in parental and resistant cells, and found that LC3II (reflects autophagic activity) levels were lower in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, with or without chloroquine (a classic inhibitor of autophagy that alters the acidic environment of lysosomes thus blocks the binding of autophagosomes to lysosomes; Fig.  3a, b ). Moreover, levels of the mitophagy-specific markers PARKIN and PINK were also reduced in resistant cells (Fig.  3c, d ). Fluorescence imaging further revealed a lower autophagic flux in resistant cells than parental cells under sorafenib treatment (Fig.  3e ). These results indicated that mitophagy was
- overexpressing PGC1β in resistant cells resulted in a general oxidative, but cell line-specific redox homeostasis in response to sorafenib (Fig.  3k ). Together, these results suggest that the decreased PGC1β in resistant cells might result in decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation in response to sorafenib treatment. We then investigated the upstream regulation of PGC1β in sorafenib resistance in HCC. While PGC1β protein levels were decreased in resistant cells, the mRNA levels of PGC1β were increased compared with those in parental cells (Fig.  3l ), suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of PGC1β in sorafenib resistance. Moreover, analyses of PGC1β protein stability using cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis revealed an accelerated PGC1β degradation in resistant cells (Fig.  3m ). Furthermore, blocking the proteasome with the addition of MG132 increased PGC1β protein in resistant cells to equivalent levels or higher levels in parental cells (Fig.  3n ). These results suggest that proteasome-mediated PGC1β degradation is increased in resistant cells compared with that in parental cells.

It has been shown that the performance of a solar collector can be significantly improved by adding amounts of nanoparticles to the working fluid. The benefit of nanofluids as a working fluid raises the thermal conductivity, which leads to more thermal energy production. In other words, by increasing the thermal conductivity, more thermal energy is produced at higher temperatures. That is, the difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the solar collector increases. Fig.  12  shows the thermal conductivity of different HTFs versus particle volume fraction. Obviously, by adding nanoparticle to the working fluids, the value of k of the heat transfer fluid increases. For instance, at φ = 5%, the value of k of water/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.36% higher than that of water. In such a context, the thermal conductivity of the Dowtherm Q/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.42% higher than that of Dowtherm Q. Water heat capacity is higher than Dowtherm Q, so PDC and

Shared features of connexins, innexins, and pannexins
Despite their lack of amino acid sequence similarities, the connexins and the innexins/ pannexins share structural and functional commonalities. All of these genes encode polytopic membrane proteins that have similar topologies within the membrane (Fig.  1 ). They each contain four transmembrane domains with their N-and C-termini on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, leading to the formation of two extracellular loops and one intracellular loop. The connexin topologies were originally predicted from hydropathy plots of the cloned sequences and supported by mapping of regions using site-directed antibodies  [24, 56] . Determination of the crystal structures of some connexins and innexins supported the topological models  [32,
- related family exhibiting extensive amino acid identity and similarity within their transmembrane and extracellular domains. The similarities in their extracellular loops can be described by two connexin signatures (PS00407 and PS00408,  http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00341 ). Differences and similarities in the connexin sequences have been used to define connexin subfamilies  [7, 30] , and sequence comparisons between different species have been used to identify orthologs  [18] . Currently, five connexin subfamilies are recognized (α, β, γ, δ, and ε or GJA, GJB, GJC, GJD, and GJE) (Table  1 ). A wide range of genetic diseases have been mapped to mutations of the connexin encoding genes (including deafness, neuropathies, cataracts, skeletal abnormalities, and skin diseases) (reviewed in  [9, 31, 37, 38, 46, 48, 53, 55] ). Connexins have sometimes been identified by abbreviations corresponding to these diseases, such as ODDD (oculodentodigital dysplasia), CMTX (X-linked
- crystal structures of some connexins and innexins supported the topological models  [32, 33, 34, 52] . Studies confirm that connexins, pannexins and innexins form channels with similar quaternary structures  [3, 12, 19, 32, 33, 52] . However, while connexin hemi-gap junction channels contain 6 subunits regardless of the connexin isoform, innexin hemi-gap junction channels and pannexin channels can have 6 or 8 subunits depending on the isoform (e.g. C. elegans inx-6 forms octamers, rat Panx1 forms hexamers and rat Panx2 most likely forms octamers)  [3, 33, 34] . The connexins, innexins and pannexins all contain cysteines in their extracellular loops, but they differ in the numbers of cysteines in each loop: connexins contain three, whereas innexins and pannexins contain two. The connexins, innexins and pannexins contain an invariant proline residue in the second transmembrane

Peptide 5 inhibits TGF-β1-induced Cx43 hemichannel activity and ATP release
To study the efficacy of Peptide 5 in blocking Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity in renal tubule epithelial cells, HK2 and hPTECs were incubated in TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) ± Peptide 5 (25 μM) for 48 h. Dye uptake increased in TGF-β1-treated HK2 cells to 609.4 ± 46% compared to unstimulated control (Fig.  6a  & b ), whilst co-incubation with Peptide 5 reduced uptake to 163 ± 10.2%.

- hemichannels and gap junctions depend on the concentration at which they are applied: peptide5, which contains a sequence that comprises part of the Gap27 domain (SRPTEKT), inhibits hemichannels at low (5 μM) concentration while combined gap junction/hemichannel block is only observed at high (500 μM) concentration  (O'carroll et al., 2008) . Here, we describe the effect on astroglial hemichannels of a peptide, named Gap19, that is identical to a short sequence present on the intracellular CL domain of Cx43 (Figure  1 ). Peptides mimicking CL sequences have been frequently used as control peptides for gap junction work, since it was shown that these do not inhibit gap junctional coupling  (Evans and Leybaert, 2007) . Although this specificity has already been reported for the cardiac system  (Wang et al., 2013b)  we think that it is important to validate this property for the nervous system. Indeed, this is particular relevant for the astrocytes because Cx43 hemichannels contribute to "gliotransmission" and can thus be involved in neuroglial interactions that participate to the control of

- Background
Anal incontinence is a disabling condition that adversely affects the quality of life of a considerable number of patients (2-15 % of the general population)  [1, 2] . Injury of the anal sphincters (mainly post surgical or post delivery) is the most common cause of incontinence, and surgical repair is actually the treatment of choice. Clinical studies reported a relatively good success rate of surgical repair in patients with sphincter lesions but the initial results worsened in time with only 30 % of patients demonstrating full continence 5 years after surgery  [3] [4] [5] . Other approaches such as the use of injectable bulking agents to augment anal sphincter function have been used recently in several observational studies  [6]  but generally resulted in poor outcomes  [3, 7] . Recently, the use of adult stem cells (ASC) in regenerative medicine protocols has become a promising therapeutic approach for organ or tissue repair when the conventional therapies are ineffective  [8] . Bone marrow (BM) is currently the most used source of ASC for clinical use, containing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), endothelial precursor cells (EPC), and mesenchymal stem

Some of these sections were stained with 0.1 % toluidine blue and used to quantify the regeneration of the sphincters. Because sections stained with toluidine blue provide a less detailed visualization and anatomic resolution of the anal sphincter complex than those embedded in methacrylate, the whole tissue at the site of SR was examined without separate analysis of each sphincter.

- Background
Anal incontinence is a disabling condition that adversely affects the quality of life of a considerable number of patients (2-15 % of the general population)  [1, 2] . Injury of the anal sphincters (mainly post surgical or post delivery) is the most common cause of incontinence, and surgical repair is actually the treatment of choice. Clinical studies reported a relatively good success rate of surgical repair in patients with sphincter lesions but the initial results worsened in time with only 30 % of patients demonstrating full continence 5 years after surgery  [3] [4] [5] . Other approaches such as the use of injectable bulking agents to augment anal sphincter function have been used recently in several observational studies  [6]  but generally resulted in poor outcomes  [3, 7] . Recently, the use of adult stem cells (ASC) in regenerative medicine protocols has become a promising therapeutic approach for organ or tissue repair when the conventional therapies are ineffective  [8] . Bone marrow (BM) is currently the most used source of ASC for clinical use, containing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), endothelial precursor cells (EPC), and mesenchymal stem

Histologic, immunohistochemical, morphometric study
A ring specimen including the anal canal and the terminal rectum was removed en bloc, snap frozen immediately after collection in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen, and preserved at -80 °C. Serial cryostat sections, 10 μm thick, were fixed overnight at -20 °C in formaldehyde vapors  [24]  and stored at -80 °C until use  [23] . Some of these sections were stained with 0.1 % toluidine blue and used to quantify the regeneration of the sphincters. Because sections stained with toluidine blue provide a less detailed visualization and anatomic resolution of the anal sphincter complex than those embedded in methacrylate, the whole tissue at the site of SR was examined without separate analysis of each sphincter. A mean of eight microscopic fields were manually searched at the site of repair at 4× magnification and the muscle area fraction (MAF) was evaluated with the "Area" function

- respectively. Nevertheless, a mixed repair of the sphincter complex may occur after a crushed injury, and the contribution of stem cells to such a repair needs to be further investigated. Another interesting finding is that there were no significant differences between results of the two groups treated with MSC. Autologous cells undoubtedly present major advantages; however, allogenic cells may be useful when a rapid employement is required, even if a period of immunosuppressive therapy has to be administered.  41  In our experiment, immunosuppression with CsA had no negative effects on the outcome of sphincter repair associated with MSC injection. Furthermore, it has been shown that various stem cell types, including muscle-derived cells, can differentiate into muscle lineage.  42, 43  Thus, additional studies will be necessary in the future to examine and compare different stem cells proposed to anal sphincter repair after injury.

CONCLUSIONS
This study provides an experimental basis for potential future clinical application of stem cells therapy for anal sphincter injuries. Stem cells could be injected at the moment of surgical repair or percutaneously by ultrasonographic guide in selected injured areas and improve the regeneration and the healing of damaged anal sphincters. Nevertheless, further studies are required

1, 2  The mechanism of continence is complex and involves many structures and pathways. Disruption of the anal sphincters is one of the most common causes of anal incontinence and may occur as the result of obstetric injury, anorectal surgery, or trauma.  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Sphincter repair is the operation of choice in patients with damaged anal sphincters, and clinical series have reported a relatively good success rate after treatment. However, the initial symptomatic improvement is not always maintained with time and long-term outcome remains unsatisfactory.  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  Many reports have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (MSC) can differentiate into mature cells of many tissues.  15, 16  In particular, injected MSC engraft and form multinucleated myotubes in skeletal muscle under appropriate stimuli, i.e., injury, contributing to muscle regeneration.

- after volatile concentrations are increased in the liquid as the result of the crystallization of anhydrous phases. The net volume change on crystallization is usually negative  (Peterson 1987) , leading to a net contraction but, when fluids are exsolved and plagioclase crystallizes, the net volume change is positive and a crystallization overpressure develops. This overpressure is in addition to any overpressure from derived compaction in the crystallizing pile. Thus, as seen in Fig.  12 , the base of the chamber comprises solid degassed cumulates, with no porosity. This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber. Because the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others. Fluids are likely to collect in those rocks which have significant residual
- Finally, we make a comparison between the Bushveld breccia pipe and kimberlite pipes, leading to a discussion of our proposed model for the emplacement of the Bushveld breccia pipe.

Development of overpressure from crystallization
Fluid overpressure can develop by a combination of two processes: (1) compaction of the crystal pile, such that any interstitial fluid supports a lithostatic load in excess of the hydrostatic pressure on the fluid, and (2) crystallization overpressure and fluid separating from an interstitial liquid which cannot escape from the crystal pile as fast as it is being generated. In the following we examine the second cause in more detail. As anhydrous minerals crystallize from a vapor-saturated liquid, separation of a volatile-rich fluid must occur. This can lead to an overpressured situation. For example,  Burnham (1979)  has shown how differentiation-induced redistribution of water in a magma body can lead to local vapor saturation and to the rapid upward migration of the vapor. Furthermore, the effect of degassing a fluid on magma pressures and on the eruption behavior of a shallow magma chamber has been examined by  Tait et al. (1989) .  Boudreau
- developed only when plagioclase joined the liquidus. This result is due to a relatively higher molar volume of plagioclase compared with that of the interstitial liquid. Thus, for overpressure to develop, the combined crystallization expansion of plagioclase and exsolution of water is required to overcome the crystallization contraction of the other crystallizing phases. Furthermore, the isochoric P-T plot of fluid-saturated magmas demonstrates that an overpressure of about 400 bar can be generated. Plagioclase-saturated liquids develop overpressures immediately, because plagioclase is the first mineral to crystallize, but less overpressure is developed. The requirement that plagioclase joins the liquidus for crystallization overpressure to develop is significant because the breccia pipe is located stratigraphically about 800 to 1,000 m above where plagioclase first appears as an abundant interstitial mineral: it is a modest but obvious increase in the amount of interstitial plagioclase which marks the base of the Lower Critical Zone. Thus, the model results are consistent with our geochemical data: the plagioclase analyzed from pipe blocks has an average An content which does not disagree with an origin near the base

- a role for eosinophils in orchestrating the regrowth of liver after injury. Moreover, our work has elucidated a direct mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 signals via the hepatocyte IL-4Rα to stimulate liver regeneration. In broad terms, these findings suggest that activation of type 2 immunity is integrally linked to reparative and regenerative programs in tissues, thereby exemplifying the host's protective strategy of tolerance against tissue damage  (8, 32) . In support of this idea, we recently reported that eosinophil-derived IL-4 facilitates muscle regeneration  (11) . Last, the ability of IL-4 to induce cell cycle progression in hepatocytes and protect against toxin-mediated injury has potential clinical implications for augmenting liver growth and regeneration in patients with liver disease. Our studies differ in a number of important ways from a recent report that demonstrated a role for IL-4 in liver regeneration  (23) . First, using homozygous KN2 mice that lack IL-4 (24), we failed to detect any differences in liver's regenerative response to injury. A substantial defect in liver regeneration was observed in IL-4/IL-13 knockout mice, which suggests that functional redundancy between IL-4 and

These results highlight a previously unappreciated role for eosinophils in inducing hepatocyte proliferation after injury and implicate eosinophil-derived factors in the orchestration of liver regeneration. Eosinophils Recruited to Injured Liver Secrete IL-4. Among the factors secreted by eosinophils, IL-4 has been implicated in both wound repair and liver regeneration  (8, 12, (19) (20) (21) . We thus evaluated the competence of eosinophils for IL-4 secretion in injured liver. After CCl 4 -induced liver injury, eosinophils, which can be distinguished by their expression of sialic acid-binding Ig receptor (Siglec-F)  (15) , were the predominant cell type competent for IL-4 secretion (Fig.  2A  and Fig.  S5B ) in IL-4 reporter mice (4get mice), a knock-in strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the IL-4 locus  (22) . Similarly, partial hepatectomy in 4get mice demonstrated that ∼81-84% of GFP + cells were eosinophils
- The liver is a central organ for the synthesis and storage of nutrients, production of serum proteins and hormones, and breakdown of toxins and metabolites. Because the liver is susceptible to toxin-or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth. Specifically, in response to injury, quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and undergo DNA replication to promote liver regrowth. Despite the elucidation of a number of regenerative factors, the mechanisms by which liver injury triggers hepatocyte proliferation are incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that eosinophils stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and toxin-mediated injury. Liver injury results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to promote the proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Surprisingly, signaling via the IL-4Rα in macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue repair, is dispensable for hepatocyte proliferation and liver regrowth after injury. Instead, IL-4 exerts its proliferative actions via IL-4Rα in hepatocytes. Our findings thus provide a unique mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver. L iver is a highly regenerative organ in mammals. As

In contrast, other studies argue that low-input farming systems, such as organic agriculture, are vital for safeguarding important ecosystem services  [20] [21] [22]  . Whether and under which conditions low-input or organic agricultural systems are able to feed the world is fiercely debated  23, 24  , warranting further investigation  25  . In the context of studies assessing the strategies of land-based climate-change mitigation, the future development of human diets  26, 27  and efficiency gains in global livestock systems  [28] [29] [30] [31]  have been identified as crucial. However, because of their large feed requirements, efficiency gains in livestock systems that are based on the enhanced use of croplandderived concentrate feedstuff can also aggravate land competition for food production  8, 28, 32  . In contrast, the use of land that is not directly usable for food production with ruminants has an important potential to contribute to food security and the maintenance of livelihoods in specific contexts  [33] [34] [35]  . This

We find that the reduction in selfsufficiency associated with the MEAT diet cannot, or can only partly, be compensated for by strategies that aim at ubiquitously closing currently prevailing yield gaps on cropland  19  , a strategy identified as instrumental to warranting food security and to reducing biomass harvest and cropland demand on the global scale  8, 16, 41, 47  . Massive cropland expansion into grazing land could mitigate this trade-off (Supplementary Table  9 ). Our analysis reveals that this could reduce import dependencies in some regions, but it would do so at the expense of encroachment of farming into semi-natural or natural land, which is associated with considerable socio-ecological costs  48  . Note that our results do not assume any trade barriers because they were calculated as the biomass trade flows that would be required to compensate for regional deficits in biomass supply. Socioeconomic barriers or obstacles to biomass trade, which could result from subsidy systems, tariffs or other regulations, could narrow the options space by rendering more scenarios unfeasible.

Furthermore, a decreasing share of livestock products in human diets could also be associated with health benefits, particularly in the industrialized regions  40, 42  . However, it is important to note that livestock provides many services other than food, for example, draught power, nutrient management and risk avoidance. For instance, livestock enables the use of land that cannot be used for cropping due to harsh environmental conditions and thus helps broaden society's resource base  33, 34, 43  . This effect becomes visible in our analysis in scenarios that combine low yields with little cropland expansion. In such contexts, diets relatively high in ruminant products show advantages over the monogastric-based variants. With increased cropland production, however, this advantage of ruminant livestock is lost. Yields show a smaller effect than human diets on the overall option space, but low yield levels limit the number of feasible scenarios, particularly for diets with meat, which are affected primarily by cropland constraints. In this vein, our results suggest  that

Molecular Basis of pDC Lineage Commitment
The upregulation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (E protein) E2-2 serves as a key lineage commitment event in pDC development, as E2-2-deficient hematopoietic progenitors fail to produce pDCs  (32) . The exact cellular stage of E2-2 induction is unknown and awaits the analysis of single-cell reporter strains for E2-2 expression. More importantly, the signals for E2-2 induction in pDCs remain obscure and may represent soluble factors, cell-associated ligands, and/or upstream transcription factors. It is noteworthy that E2-2 is expressed at significant levels in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and B lymphocytes; thus, a merely quantitative several-fold upregulation of E2-2 underlies pDC commitment. Importantly, pDCs show particularly low expression of the E protein inhibitor Id2, in contrast to abundant Id2 expression in T,NK, and myeloid cells  (25, 32) . The absence of Id2 expression likely serves as an important counterpart of E2-2 upregulation, increasing the effective E2-2 concentration in
- the resulting gross tumor and supraphysiological Flt3L levels likely affect pDC ground state and functionality. Another practical consideration involves gene targeting in mice: Some Crerecombinase-expressing deleter strains such as the T cell-specific CD4-Cre strain mediate efficient off-target recombination in pDCs  (41) . Thus, a careful analysis of recombination in pDCs is required to exclude its potential contribution to the phenotype in conditional targeting experiments.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF pDCs
We have recently reviewed the developmental origin and transcriptional control of the pDC lineage (6). Here we provide a brief update and highlight several issues that await resolution in future studies. Some of the points discussed below are incorporated into the proposed scheme of pDC development (Figure  1 ).

pDC Progenitors
Most pDCs develop from common DC progenitors (CDP, or pro-DCs), a distinct progenitor type in the bone marrow that expresses cytokine receptors Flt3 (CD135), M-CSFR (CD115), and low levels of c-Kit (CD117)  (42, 43) . It is noteworthy that Flt3 + c-Kit low is a broad definition of lymphoid
- as the highly pDC-enriched transcription factor Runx2 (25) and other candidates, must be characterized from scratch. Finally, it should be of interest to elucidate the epigenetic events (e.g., chromatin modifications) that accompany pDC commitment, maintenance, and activation.

A Novel pDC-Related Dendritic Cell Subset
A simple linear view of E2-2-driven pDC development recently became more complicated, as a novel pDC-related cDC subset in mice was identified using Cx3cr1 as a marker  (60) . Unlike the classical CD8 + cDCs, the alternative CD8-expressing Cx3cr1 + cDCs develop independently of transcription factor Batf3, do not cross-present antigen, and cannot be expanded by Flt3L. Instead, these cells carry IgH D→J rearrangements typical of pDCs, express many pDC-related genes including E2-2, and indeed fail to develop from E2-2deficient bone marrow. On the other hand, Cx3cr1 + CD8 + cDCs do not secrete IFN and express significantly lower levels of E2-2 and other pDC-specific genes than do

Next, we manually inspected each locus and grouped them according to our confidence in their TF func tionality (Supplementary information S1 (PDF); the full data set is found in Supplementary information S3 (.txt file)): at the highest level, probable TFs have experi mental evidence for regulatory function in any mam malian organism or have an equivalent protein domain arrangement; possible TFs contain nonpromiscuous InterPro DNAbinding domains that are never found in nonTFs, but for which we do not have further func tional evidence; and unlikely TFs comprise predicted genes, genes containing promiscuous InterPro DNA binding domains or genes with an established molecular function other than transcription (such as nucleoporins, threonine phosphatases or splicing factors). Finally, we also included 27 curated probable TFs from other sources, such as GO or TRANSFAC  33  ; these TFs contain undefined DNAbinding domains, and were therefore missed using the above procedure. This resulted in a highconfidence data set of 1,391 genomic loci (~6% of the total number of protein coding genes) that encode TFs, which we will focus on for the remainder of this Analysis article, and a further 216 loci
- inspecting every entry in the data set, we have minimized such errors. As a result the repertoire here is of high quality, and can be used as a basis to design further computational and experimental studies. Most of these TFs remain uncharacterized: this is highlighted by the observation that just three regulators (p53, eR and FOS) have more publications than all the other TFs put together. By incorporating publicly avail able genomic data sets, we provide clues into how these TFs might operate. For example, the SymAtlas microar ray data set allowed us to investigate the expression of TFs across 32 major tissues. Our analysis expanded the existing knowledge of ubiquitous and specific regulators by illustrating this phenomenon on a genomewide scale. Intriguingly, few TFs are present in an intermediate number of tis sues. This pattern of expression will have implications
- to identify the full complement of human TFs  29, 30  . Some previous studies of TF repertoires -particu larly those in large genomes -may contain misleading predictions for several reasons. Most of these studies depended on identifying genes that are homologous to previously characterized regulators; however, there are technical limitations to sequence search methods, and algorithms can sometimes output false positive hits. Moreover, even among true positives, some DNA binding domains also exist in nonTF proteins, making these domains unreliable markers of sequencespecific DNAbinding functionality. As a result of these difficul ties, we still lack a comprehensive characterization of the human TF repertoire. Here, we overcome some of these difficulties by focusing on a precise definition of sequencespecific DNAbinding regulators, which are among the best defined protein domains. We also minimize prediction errors by manually examining each locus that encodes a potential DNAbinding function. In doing so, we present a comprehensive and highquality census of TFs in the human genome. As most of these TFs have not been experimentally characterized for regulatory function, we evaluate their tissuespecific expression, genomic distribution and evolutionary conservation. Together, these results provide a solid foundation for further systematic characterization of human TFs in their bio logical context,

Photopatterning of these materials can then be achieved using the remaining olefin groups via a thiol-ene coupling reaction. After cross-linking, the olefin IR-absorption band is minimized and the T g of the matrix material increases.

To demonstrate the low-loss nature of the matrix materials, the polymer was incorporated into an all-dielectric, infrared metamaterial. A planarizing layer of

Classically, low-loss metamaterial surfaces have been fabricated on high-index substrates (silicon, germanium, etc.) to avoid phonon coupling and absorption.  5, 25, 26  High-index materials are non-ideal dielectric matrix materials because they lead to significant boundary mismatch losses, induce leakage in dielectric resonators, and increase fabrication difficulty by reducing the electrical length of the metamaterial resonators. These materials are also difficult to incorporate in the 3D constructs and require challenging polishing steps to ensure planarization. Transparent dielectrics are far more attractive but traditional low-index materials such as silicon dioxide, aluminum dioxide, and barium fluoride all exhibit strong phonon absorption modes in the thermal infrared and are equally difficult to planarize for 3D designs. Thus, the ideal dielectric matrix material for LWIRmetamaterial applications would be simultaneously low-loss, low-index, and allow for solution deposition for simple planarization. Low loss photopatternable polymer dielectics appear to be a promising solution.

- for crystallization is the formation of duplex DNA linkages: The most stable structure will maximize the number of duplex DNA connections between particles. The simplicity of this hypothesis allows us to understand the behavior of the SNA-NPs in the context of assembly so well that we have been able to develop a set of design rules for the process of crystal formation  [17] . Like Pauling's rules for atoms, these rules explain the relative stability of different lattices as a function of their DNA and nanoparticle building blocks. However, unlike Pauling's rules, this rule set allows one to predict the stability of crystal structures before they are ever synthesized. Therefore, one can direct the formation of a desired crystal structure by controlling different aspects of the building blocks, such as nanoparticle size, nanoparticle shape, DNA length, or DNA sequence  [17] . The first rule in DNA-mediated assembly is: SNA-NPs of equal hydrodynamic radii will form an fcc lattice when using self-complementary DNA sequences, and a bcc lattice when using two SNA-NPs with complementary DNA sequences (Fig.  1 ). When assembling particles with a self-complementary sticky end, all particles are able to form DNA linkages with all other particles in solution.
- taken major strides in being able to utilize this structure as a building block in the synthesis of ordered arrays of nanoparticles. Although early attempts yielded materials that exhibited no long range ordering, short-range ordering and interparticle distance control was demonstrated in subsequent years  [35] . Long-range ordering and crystalline materials were achieved for the first time in 2008 by altering the SNA-NP design to utilize DNA linker strands to connect the nanoparticles  [36] . These linkers consisted of three basic regions: a recognition sequence complementary to the DNA sequence physically attached to the nanoparticle, a spacer sequence used to control the length of the DNA linker, and a short sticky end presented at the hydrodynamic radius of the SNA-NP. Hybridization interactions between sticky ends on adjacent SNA-NPs allow the nanoparticle to link to one another. Because each SNA-NP can be attached to tens to hundreds of DNA linker strands (depending on the nanoparticle core size)  [24] , each nanoparticle can form tens to hundreds of DNA connections to adjacent particles. It is therefore the key hypothesis of our efforts in SNA-NP assembly that, because the driving force for crystallization is the formation of duplex DNA linkages: The most stable structure will maximize the number
- 90 % agreement between the two; i. e. over 90% of the crystal structures obtained experimentally were correctly predicted by the phase diagram as being the most stable arrangement of particles. Because each of the SNA-NPs used to assemble these superlattices is functionalized with a large number of DNA strands, it is possible to put multiple DNA sequences on a single nanoparticle. Therefore, the fifth rule of DNA-programmed assembly is: SNA-NPs can be functionalized with more than one oligonucleotide bonding element, providing access to crystal structures not possible with single element SNA-NPs. For example, a SNA-NP that is functionalized with linkers containing self-complementary sticky ends would be predicted to form an fcc lattice as its thermodynamic product, as per rule 1. However, if this SNA-NP were also functionalized with a second type of DNA linker that contained a sticky end complementary to the sticky ends of a different SNA-NP, additional DNA linkages could be created. This enables the synthesis of NaCl-type lattices, where the self-complementary sticky ends dictate the formation of an fcc lattice, but the additional sticky ends allow a second nanoparticle to fill into the

The winter movement range was calculated as the minimum convex polygon of 100% of the winter locations to be comparable with a previous study  (Meyburg et al. 2004) , and the home-ranges were calculated as the 95% and 50% kernel utilization distribution (Garc ıa-Ripoll es et al. 2010). Besides individual home-ranges, we also calculated a population-level 95% and 50% utilization distribution including winter locations of all individuals to delineate the area in which conservation measures for the species would be most urgently required. We estimated areas of movement and home-ranges in the R package 'adehabitatHR' using

- years, however, there has been increasing awareness that events during migration or on wintering grounds can affect populations of migratory animals 
(Newton 2004 , Studds & Marra 2005 , Both et al. 2006) . Identifying migration routes, stopover areas and wintering areas for migratory species that are declining is therefore necessary for designing effective conservation strategies that can address threats operating outside breeding areas  (Wilcove & Wikelski 2008) . The decline of long-distance migrants has been most apparent for passerines and smaller-bodied birds but there is evidence that long-distance migratory raptors are also declining  (Hoffman & Smith 2003) . Among the four vulture species that breed in the western Palaearctic, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is the only longdistance migrant that travels to wintering regions in sub-Saharan Africa  (Porter & Beaman 1985 , Meyburg et al. 2004 , Garc ıa-Ripoll es et al. 2010) . Egyptian Vulture populations in Europe have been declining for decades but the reasons for population declines are still poorly understood and are likely to be a combination of several known threats such as

The in situ printing experiment was conducted in the helium atmosphere to reduce the air scattering. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 M lead acetate (Pb(Ac) 2 ) and 1.2 M methylammonium iodide (MAI) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). A PEDOT:PSS-coated silicon wafer was used as the sample substrate. Different substrate temperatures were adjusted to control the kinetics of crystallisation. A series of 2D GIXD images at different stages of drying are shown in Fig.  1  and Supplementary Fig.  2 . In a starting solution, the mixed precursors are essentially point scatters dissolved in DMF, where the liquid scattering from DMF dominates, with a diffuse reflection at qB1.5 Å À 1 being evident.

The time evolution of the film morphology under in situ heating is obtained by the compound optical microscope. The formation of periodic patterns during the growth process is observed which could be attributed to a competition between the linear growth of the crystals and a depletion of crystallisable material. The crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic nucleation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation from molecular to microstructure is successfully demonstrated.


Results
Perovskites crystallisation and structure transformation. All GIXD measurements were performed on beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Sources of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with critical methods to obtain the perovskites structure formation and crystal growth in real time. To in situ monitor the whole evolution process at the very beginning with the precursor solution, a compatible mini-slot-die printer  20  was integrated with on-line GIXD, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 .

Also, the value of E a for lead acetate precursor from slot die printing in our research is larger than 67.5 kJ mol À 1 obtained from traditional spin coating  27  . This could be mainly because of the different thermal kinetics of different procedure as well as the different sample ambient environments such as humility and so on. The plots along with the fittings are shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 . The transformation time (ln (t w2 À t w1 )) is inversely proportional to T, thus the perovskite transformation time decreases dramatically with the increasing temperature. This is also consistent with our experiment results. Perovskite chemical structure evolution at RT was studied using in situ FTIR.

Nevertheless, there is hope that remote sensing of atmospheric CO 2 could provide better spatial and temporal coverage of atmospheric CO 2 and hence carbon sinks, allowing the attribution of their spatial-temporal patterns to their drivers, in a similar way that attribution of climate change. Benchmarking of carbon cycle models is now possible, several datasets can be used to constrain global carbon cycle models, both for the land and the ocean  [61, 63] . Although they cannot directly constrain the carbon cycle sensitivities, they can help evaluate to ability of models to simulate the mean state of the system, such as gross fluxes and reservoirs. Finally, there are numerous other biological processes that can be affected by climate change, and potentially induce a feedback on the human induced warming, such as N 2 O emissions, isoprene and ozone chemistry, fires and aerosols emissions. A recent review of these candidates showed a very low confidence in their estimate as often based on very few studies, but fail to find large potential feedbacks others than the ones already discussed here  [64] .

Some earlier studies found an enhanced terrestrial productivity  [31]  while later studies found the opposite  [32, 33] . The third assessment report of IPCC concluded that, by mid-twenty-first century, climate change would reduce the land carbon uptake by 21% to 43% and the ocean carbon uptake by 6% to 25%, relative to CO 2 only driven uptakes  [34] . This IPCC range was very conservative, as further discussed below. Nevertheless, all these studies gave a clear signal to the climate modelling community: one cannot simulate future climate change assuming atmospheric CO 2 can be known, a priori, from the CO 2 emissions trajectory. The evolution of atmospheric CO 2 results from the balance between the CO 2 emissions and the land and ocean carbon sinks, these last ones being a complex function of atmospheric CO 2 and climate. Hence the CO 2 -climate system is coupled, future climate change depends on atmospheric CO 2 increase (and other forcing agents); but in return, atmospheric
- the last millennium climate probably explores a too narrow range of climate variations to trigger large release of carbon from permafrost, and, as mentioned above, the emerging constraint is limited to tropical ecosystems. Although not included in ESMs yet, permafrost ecosystems are now being represented in land surface models, and estimate of the potential release of carbon from these systems have been made recently  [57] [58] [59] [60] . Estimates vary widely due to uncertainty in the processes at play (rate of soil thawing, fine-scale processes, fraction of carbon released, potential mitigating role of nutrient, etc.). The IPCC AR5 concluded, 'There is high confidence that reductions in permafrost extent due to warming will cause thawing of some currently frozen carbon. However, there is low confidence on the magnitude of carbon losses through CO 2 and CH 4 emissions to the atmosphere, with a range from 50 to 250 GtC between 2000 and 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario'  [4] . The climatepermafrost carbon gain is hence very uncertain; as the RCP8.5 emissions are about 2000 GtC for the twenty-first century, the permafrost carbon

III. RESULTS FOR DIAMOND AND TRANS -POLYACETYLENE
The applicability of the presented approach for treating the divergencies is now demonstrated by applying it to two cases, diamond and trans-polyacetylene, using different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals: the Slater-Dirac (exchange-only LDA) referred to as Dirac exchange in the following, the complete exchange-correlation LDA in the parametrisation of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN), 8 the combination of Dirac exchange plus Perdew86 9 (P86) correlation (P86 being VWN correlation plus a gradient correction), the EXX (exact-exchange only), and finally the combination of EXX with P86 correlation. The pseudopotentials were generated using the pseudopotential
- combination of EXX with P86 correlation. The pseudopotentials were generated using the pseudopotential generation code of Engel,  26  which is based on the Troullier-Martins norm-conserving scheme.  27  In all cases the pseudopotentials were generated using consistently the same functionals for exchange and correlation as for the plane wave calculations. Relativistic effect are not included. The pseudopotentials of C are all constructed using a cutoff radius of 1.3 a.u. for both s and p levels. We constructed for the calculations of trans-polyacetylene chains hydrogen pseudopotentials with a cutoff radius of 0.9 a.u.. For diamond, the energy cutoff of the plane-wave basis is 60 Ry for the one-particle functions, and 20 Ry for the exchange potential and the response function 2 . For trans-polyacetylene,  28  we reduced the energy cutoffs to 32 Ry for the one-particle functions and 12 Ry for the exchange potential and the response function, because we are interested to determine the effect of the singularity function in terms of several possible k points meshes, and study meshes with a large number of k points. The lattice constants for diamond were
- In the first iteration numerical integration is carried out only in the outer region. Then in the inner region, where the singularity is located, the number of points is tripled and a second iteration proceeds as the first one, working now on the outer part of the inner region of the first iteration. By moving on in this fashion the algorithm triples the mesh size around the singularity in each iteration step. Therefore, the integration result is more accurate than with any regular mesh. We observe that less than 10 steps, depending on the lattice vectors considered, are sufficient to get the integral converged. The implementation of the described numerical integration is straightforward leading to about 200 lines of Fortran instructions. The computational time for carrying out the integration is negligible. Having considered in detail the treatment of the singularities in the exchange energy we now briefly present the corresponding treatment of singularities in the evaluation of the matrix elements of the non-local exchange potential, which is required in the HF selfconsistency process, or can be used in the construction of the local KS exchange potential 1,2 during the self-consistency process of a KS calculation.

However, as compared to polymers P2, P3 and P4 (all containing pyridine moieties), its stretchability was reduced. This suggests that the introduction of pyridine moieties may contribute to the enhanced mechanical properties either through participating in intra-and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding or through changing the morphology of the film. Finally, reference polymer P7 was synthesized to remove the hydrogen-bonding amide hydrogens (Fig.  1a ). P7 showed a decreased stretchability with an onset strain for crack formation of about 25% (Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Fig.  18g ). The above control experiments with reference polymers further confirm the important contribution of the dynamic non-covalent hydrogenbond-forming moieties as strain-releasing elements for enhancing the stretchability of conjugated polymers.

- The x-y pixel size was 8 nm for both systems unless noted. SEM images were acquired for every 2 nm of material removal. After the final image series were registered using IMOD  (Kremer et al., 1996)  or SIFT plug-in of Fiji  (Schindelin et al., 2012) , every four consecutive images were binned down to one, forming an image stack with isotropic voxels of 8 Â 8 Â 8 nm 3 . The gallium FIB column was operated at 30 keV. A 7-nA probe current was selected for milling with the FEI Magnum column, while a 13-or 27-nA probe current was used in a Zeiss NVision40. A repeated line scan of 0.1 mm pixel and 1-MHz frequency was applied. A 10 Hz PID closed-loop algorithm written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controlled the line scan position relative to the specimen block-face. To minimize overhead, the milling time was typically set to be less than 20% of SEM imaging time. With a 200 Â 200 mm 2 block-face specimen, the milling time was around 10 s or less for every frame (2
- found that a positive bias of the specimen above 500 eV can more directly and effectively filter out low-energy secondary electrons that are detected by the InLens detector, while maintaining a larger collection angle for the backscattered electrons (Figure  11g ). The positively biased InLens image eliminates the rectangular electron burn spot and appears very similar to that of EsB image (Figure  11a ), but with noticeably improved SNR. The bias enables the InLens detector to offer much improved material contrast, with a ~5-10x gain on electron counts compared to EsB alone, and also removes the mild streak artifacts otherwise visible ~20 mm downstream on the milled surface (Figure  11i ). Moreover, the signal from both detectors can be combined through a simple weighted average to further lower shot noise without degrading image contrast  (Unser and Eden, 1990) .

SEM signal-to-noise ratio
SEM imaging is usually the rate-determining step in a FIB-SEM procedure, since the milling procedure is faster (typically up to a voxel size of 24 nm or greater). To understand the limits of fast imaging, it is important to consider the SNR of the image. The signal is simply the number of electrons that
- that when the system deviated from steady state, the SEM focus and stigmation changes correlated nicely with the lateral image shifts, which were easily obtained by registering adjacent images. Standard image registration methods such as cross correlation, Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT), or Super Robust Feature Transformation (SRFT) could be used to calculate image shifts between adjacent frames. An empirical model was developed to apply offsets derived from image shifts to the optimal imaging parameters until the steady state was restored. The time to reach steady state was significantly shortened with the aid of a shutter underneath the SEM column (see Section "FIB-SEM column configuration"). We found that in most cases, no offset was needed after the SEM shutter was implemented. The FIB focus was also monitored before and after gallium source reheat, and controlled for smooth continuation. By implementing these measures, image focus could be restored immediately or within one frame after a restart, eliminating seams in the final image stack.

Multiple magnifications at user-selected intervals
Multiple resolutions are often needed to resolve different features in an image stack, and to provide context. One option is to image the entire volume using the highest resolution needed. However, it proved far more efficient to change imaging resolution at different locations. For example, in a

The apparatus was designed for the temperature range between 90 and 400 K. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to the sample crystals using helium gas as the pressure-transmitting medium. The pressure range of the measurement was between 0.

One of them corresponds to the tetragonal phase of the chloride and the other to that of the iodide. In a recent paper  [5] , we reported calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I), where MA represents the methylammonium ion, CH,NH: . All the phase transitions were of the first order. The large transition entropies indicated that the phase transitions are of the order-disorder type. The entropy values were interpreted with structural models in which each MA ion is disordered with respect to the orientations of the C-N axis itself and around the C-N axis. In the present paper, we investigate the pressure dependence of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) by using a high pressure DTA.

An initial amount of lithium (several coulombs per cm 2) was deposited on a nickel or copper electrode. Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency. Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc  [1]  where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number

The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +. Typical measurements of working electrode potential changes during cycling efficiency experiments are illustrated in Fig.  2 . A periodic galvanostatic operation of the cell described in Fig.  1  was carried out by triggering the PAR (Model 173) potentiostat (set to galvanostatie mode) by a square waveform generator built specially for these experiments. ,Spectroscopic measurements.--The FTIR measurements of Li electrodes are described in detail elsewhere  (11) (12) (13) .

In other experiments, Li electrodes were cycled 5-30 times, followed by prolonged dissolution (twice the charge involved in a single half cycle) as a final process. SEM studies of these electrodes show that the density and average size of the dendrites left increase as a function of n u m b e r of cycles. Table  I  summarizes the data obtained from the cycling efficiency m e a s u r e m e n t s of Li electrodes in the various systems.

It should be noticed that the values of Table I are s o m e w h a t lower than cycling efficiency values of same solvents that appear in the literature  (20) (21) (22) . There are two major reasons for these differences: 1. The values of Table  I  were obtained from experiments in which lithium was deposited on nickel or copper substrates. Naturally, lithium deposition on a lithium substrate is expected to have a higher efficiency, since adherence of Li deposits to lithium substrate is better  (23) . 2.

Finally, a strong correlation has been observed between the SERS excitation wavelength and the SPR maximum  36, 37  . Maximum enhancement is achieved under resonant excitation conditions, which requires that the excitation laser is tuned near the plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle substrate or, alternatively, that the plasmon resonance of the substrate is tuned near the excitation-laser wavelength.

Aggregated colloidal particles show localized areas of intense local fields, or 'hot spots' , that give rise to the largest enhancement factors and make single-molecule SERS possible. However, the heterogeneity of 'hot spots' in SERS substrates consisting of nanoparticle aggregates makes quantitative measurements unreliable and optimization difficult. For the past few years there has been a great emphasis on rationally designing substrate geometries to achieve large enhancement factors. A variety of shapes and geometries have been explored as SERS substrates, including metal island films  38  , large silver

Fabrication of this large variety of different structures makes a variety of applications possible, as the spectral position of the surface plasmon resonance depends on both the shape and the size of the nanoparticle. For spherical nanoparticles, a resonance of the oscillating electrons with an incident optical wave occurs when the negative of the real part of the particle's dielectric constant equals twice the value of the dielectric constant of the medium (see theoretical section below). However, for non-spherical particle shapes, the electron oscillation is non-isotropic and localized either along the principal axes  18  or at the edges and corners of the nanoparticle  19  (or both), leading to an additional shape-dependent depolarization and splitting of the surface plasmon resonance into several modes (such as longitudinal and transverse modes for nanorods or symmetric and antisymmetric modes in nanoshells  20  ). A large variety of structures have been synthesized and characterized whose plasmon resonances may be varied over the entire visible to mid-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum (see Fig.  1 ). In contrast to this explosion of plasmonic nanoparticles of various shapes and sizes, the controlled assembly and integration of nanoparticles into plasmonic

LocaL fieLd enhancement
When an electromagnetic wave interacts with a roughened metallic surface or a nanoparticle, the electromagnetic fields near the surface are greatly enhanced relative to the incident electromagnetic field. This phenomenon is due to two processes. The first is the 'lightning rod' effect, conventionally described as the crowding of the electric field lines at a sharp metallic tip. The second process is the excitation of localized surface plasmons at the metal surface and is responsible for the amplification of fluorescence and second-harmonic generation from thin metal films  30  . For metal nanoparticles often both processes are involved in creating the localized enhanced near field. Although this electromagnetic enhancement effect has been exploited in several spectroscopy techniques, it is mainly the amplification of the Single-molecule spectroscopy  33, 34  has revealed that the SERS ensemble

[3]  Furthermore, the working environments of those immobilized moieties are usually harsh, which requires the frameworks to be chemically very stable. The requirement of a combination of good chemical stability and large pores means that very few candidates are widely utilized. MIL-101 and MIL-100 are two extraordinary examples that exhibit both properties and are suitable supports.  [4]  MIL-100 and MIL-101, both of which have zeotype mtn topology (zeotype refers to structures sharing the same topology with zeolites), contain super-tetrahedral cages to substitute for the tetrahedral unit in zeolites.  [5]  Hence, their largest pores reach 31Å and 29Å respectively although the organic linkers are relatively small. Moreover, the metal nodes in these MOFs are based on trivalent metal species. The strong interaction between carboxylates and high valent metal species accompanied with the small organic linker endows these frameworks with excellent chemical stability. Despite these advantages, the pore size still restricts further application of these MOFs when it comes to larger guests such as nanoparticles or enzymes.

- comes to larger guests such as nanoparticles or enzymes. Therefore, synthesis of mesoporous materials with larger pore size which also maintain excellent chemical stability is highly desired. Application of a ligand larger than those in the MIL-100 and MIL-101 MOFs to create zeotype frameworks would be an effective way to generate extra-large pores, while avoiding complicated organic synthesis to make the linker extremely large. Unfortunately, there are several challenges in the way of extending these mtn topological MOFs: First, the M 3 O(COO) 6 (M= Fe(III), Al(III), Cr(III), In(III), V(III), Sc(III)) building block is not the thermodynamically favored form, which makes the controllable formation of target products difficult;  [6]  second, even if the inorganic building block can be obtained, competitive framework isomers, such as the MIL-88 structure, still dominate as the major products; moreover, most of the synthesis needs to be conducted under hydrothermal conditions, which is infeasible for large organic linkers with poor water solubility. Therefore, searching for other zeotype frameworks, which can be synthetically controlled more easily, is one promising strategy. Through a topological

Zirconium MOFs have been extensively studied recently due to their excellent chemical stability.  [7]  One major reason is the controllable synthesis of crystalline product or even single crystals by using competing reagents.

This means that it is possible to reduce the connectivity and symmetry of Zr 6 to make it compatible with almost all kinds of organic linkers and form three dimensional (3-D) periodic frameworks.

The F point only was used for the Brillouin-zone (BZ) sampling, resulting in a rather inaccurate description of the differential DOS (i.e., pseudogaps in the DOS), but it seems to be sufficient for a good description of the interatomic forces. Li, Na and Ge were initially equilibrated using simple pair potentials  [32, 33] ; AI was melted from a simple cubic phase. For Na we have performed two model calculations, differing in the number of atoms. For the 54-atom ensemble, the Fermi-level falls into a pseudogap separating the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied band at the F-point. Therefore, the characteristic difficulties in handling metallic systems do not appear. The 60-atom ensemble on the other hand is metallic. We found no differences in the conservation of the free energy, demonstrating that our techniques works equally well in both situations. In addition, the comparison demonstrates that the influence of the boundary conditions is small.

(ii) US-pseudopotentials are no longer norm-conserving (NC). Both points together allow the use of large cut-off radii for the pseudowavefunctions and the 'softer' pseudowavefunctions make it possible to reduce the number of PW. Nevertheless, relaxing the norm-conservation constraint results in a charge-deficit between the pseudo-and the exact all-electron wavefunctions, which must be described using localized augmentation functions Qji(r). Second, an overlap operator has to be included in the orthonormality constraint and the KS eigenequations. Explicit formulas for the KS functional, the Hamiltonian, the forces and the stress tensor can be found in Refs.  [3, 25] .

- Introduction
In recent years, ab initio calculations based on the local density approximation (LDA) (for a recent review see, for example, Ref.  [1] ) have been of increased interest. The reasons for this development are evident: LDA offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy and efficiency in treating electronic many-body effects, is completely parameterfree, and with the enormous increase in computer power complex calculations are now feasible. Using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem  [2] , the calculation of forces is in principle straight forward and, for a basis set such as plane waves, relatively simple. The forces offer the possibility of relaxing atoms into their ground-state or of performing ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. With the computers now available, calculations for systems containing more than 100 particles are practicable, and the development of faster parallel computers offers a bright future for ab initio techniques. We have recently implemented a powerful LDA plane wave program (Vienna ab initio molecular dynamics simulation package (VAMP) -for a detailed description see Ref.  [3] ) which can be used to perform complex calculations for many problems (i.e., bulk, surfaces, liquid systems, molecules). In this paper we give a short review of

The mixture was covered with PE film, stirred at room temperature for about 5 h, and then put into a 60 °C drying oven to undergo the solvent evaporation process. After 2 days of aging, the solution became a light-yellow solid (when hydrochloric acid and citric acid were used, white solids were obtained). Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 °C (1 °C min -1 ramping rate) and by heating at 400 °C for 4 h in air. High-temperature treatment was carried out in air for 1 h with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min -1 . Catalyst Preparation.

We assume that volatilization behavior of the acids is an important factor that should be taken into account. The reactivity of the alumina precursors can be efficiently regulated through various methods such as careful adjustment of the pH and dilution of solutions or the use of condensation inhibitors.  37  A subsequent slowing step is necessary to irreversibly freeze a half-condensed structure and hence avoids the fast formation of an inorganic network. Inorganic hydrolysis and condensation have to be controlled to fabricate a robust mesostructure instead of a hard solid. As for our synthesis, the starting solutions are relatively dilute, and the inorganic polymerization can be readily dominated by an acid, which is subsequently removed by evaporation. In the case of this system, as the volatility of HCl is higher than that of HNO 3 , the acidity of the whole system added with HCl in evaporation process reduces more quickly and thus consequently

By utilizing the dip-coating method, Sanchez et al. synthesized ordered nanocrystalline γ-Al 2 O 3 films with contracted fcc mesoporosity.  16  Following the above work, Grosso, D. et al. improved the synthesis procedure and fabricated ordered nanocrystalline mesoporous γ-alumina powders by aerosol generation of the initial solution using an ITS atomizer.  17  After treatment at 700 °C γ-alumina was obtained and it could be stable up to 900 °C. Recently, Zhang and co-workers  18  developed an ordered crystalline mesoporous alumina molecular sieve with CMK-3 as hard template, which presented a new route to obtain ordered mesoporous alumina. However, this synthesis procedure requires multiple steps and is time-consuming. From the viewpoint of synthesis, it is still a significant challenge to obtain γ-alumina with highly ordered mesostructures via a one-step, convenient, and economic approach. Moreover, the thermal stability and catalysis properties of ordered mesoporous alumina have not been studied in detail yet.

Hence, for evaluation purposes, we leveraged BLAT short read spliced alignments in S. pombe and TopHat alignments in mouse. BLAT alignments of short reads to the S. pombe genome were performed using the pipeline described above with the following settings: maximum intron length set to 500 bases, maximum distance between read pairs of 500, and only the single best alignment was reported per read. TopHat alignments to the mouse genome were performed using the following parameters: minimum intron length of 50 bases, maximum intron of 100kb, and mate inner distance set to 300 bases. Transcribed strand information was assigned to the individual reads based on knowledge of the fragment type (left or right) and the aligned strand of the genome. Both Cufflinks (version 0.9.3) 2 and Scripture 3 (version VPaperR3, obtained from Scripture author Manuel Garber) were executed on these alignments.

Trinity performed well across a range of 10M to the full 150M input sequence reads, while the alternative methods tended to peak at ~50M pairs or smaller inputs (Supplementary Fig.  6a online ). In mouse (RefSeq annotation set, Fig.  5b ), Trinity (8185 transcripts, 7749 genes) outperformed the other de novo assembly methods ABySS (5561, 5500), Trans-ABySS (7025, 6598) and SOAPdenovo (761, 760), with the mapping-first programs Cufflinks (9010, 8536) and Scripture (9086, 8293) exhibiting better sensitivity.

Protein coding nucleotide sequences were extracted from the genome sequences based on the gene annotations using custom PERL scripts. The mouse reference coding sequences were further distilled to remove entirely identical sequences corresponding to isoforms encoding identical proteins and paralogous sequences: the original 19,947 genes encoding 23,881 transcripts were reduced to 19,857 genes encoding 22,717 on-identical coding transcripts. Reconstructed transcript sequences (via de novo assembly, Scripture, or Cufflinks) were mapped to the reference coding sequences using BLAT  35  . Full-length reference annotation mappings were defined as having at least 95% sequence identity covering the entire reference coding sequence and containing at most 5% insertions or deletions (cumulative gap content). In evaluating methods that leverage the strand-specific data (Trinity and Cufflinks), proper sense-strand mapping of sequences was required. Transcripts reconstructed by the alternative methods (Scripture, ABySS, and SOAPdenovo) were allowed to map to either strand. Fusion transcripts were identified as individual reconstructed transcripts

- have proposed that through thoughtful planning and strategic care of reefs within existing and future marine protected areas (MPAs)*, it may be possible to take advantage in two broad ways of the natural properties of coral reef ecosystems to mitigate the negative impact of bleaching on coral reef biodiversity: (1) Identify and manage specific patches of reef where local conditions are likely to result in reduced temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., coral assemblages with a high level of "resistance") to protect them from direct anthropogenic impacts. (2) Enhance the capacity for coral reef recovery ("resilience") by maintaining conditions optimal for larval dispersal and recruitment to damaged sites (requires minimizing other stresses at these sites [abatement of direct localized impacts] and analyzing larval dispersal [connectivity] to maximize recolonization). An understanding of which local environmental factors are predictors of greatest resistance and resilience to coral bleaching would help managers identify, design, and manage networks of MPAs in order to maximize overall survival of the world's coral reefs in the face of global climate change. The most useful approach would be one that utilizes natural processes rather than expensive technological fixes and helps managers focus local management and enforcement efforts on the most criti-cal areas. Given the limited
- reef recovery after mortality events have occurred. Such characteristics include the capacity of remaining corals to produce abundant and/or robust larvae that will recruit successfully and ecological interactions that can favor survivorship and growth once the recruits arrive.  Done ( 2001 )  emphasized the importance of targeting for MPA inclusion strategic locations that maximize both strong and reliable recruitment of all species within the community and the likelihood that a portion of the propagules from those communities will effectively seed other areas. In this sense, communities with diverse populations of adult corals with high fertilization success and robust larvae (which will survive, recruit, and grow successfully) can contribute not only to their own resilience but to the resilience of other "downstream" communities as well. Coral reef resilience also depends on other biological components of reef communities ( i.e., a requisite variety of functional groups)  (Gunderson 2000) . For example,  Bythell et al. ( 2000 )  studied the effects of natural mortality events resulting from hurricanes at Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. They attributed the resilience of their study reefs to the presence of sufficient grazing fish populations, which kept in check the growth of macroalgae that may otherwise have
- sites or physical conditions that enhance coral survivorship and growth. Some coral reef communities may be more resilient than others because of their physical location with regard to oceanographic conditions. For most marine species, dispersal depends on currents and other processes (such as eddies) that deliver larvae to the settlement site and even concentrate them at certain locations  ( Dayton et al. 2000) . Indeed,  Roberts ( 1997 )  found that surface currents defined most of the dispersal patterns for a large number of species in the Caribbean. Thus, patterns of connectivity should be considered in the design of any MPA network meant to maximize resilience. Besides oceanographic conditions at local or regional scales, other, localized physical parameters at a site can also affect resilience. Physical conditions on a reef may be chronically affected by anthropogenic impacts such as pollution or destructive fishing practices, which nega-tively affect the ability of coral assemblages to recover from natural disasters  (Hughes & Connell 1999) . Hence, reefs with effective management in place-such that direct anthropogenic stresses are kept to a minimum in that area-are likely to have a higher resilience after bleaching episodes than reefs that are already suffering from multiple stressors  (Salm &

- the cells-were assessed but did not correlate with growth. In addition to considering expression distributions and cell cycle subpopulations, single-cell gene expression can be used to generate an expression network per sample. This is in contrast to most systems biology approaches in human genetic epidemiology that describe a network of all samples combined, rather than the more explicit comparison of network parameters between samples. Gene expression noise can thus be treated as a third form of perturbation, together with genetic and chemical perturbation. Figure  2b  plots an example of cell-to-cell gene correlations in ~200 cells from one of the lymphoblastoid cell lines, for genes detected in at least 50% of the cells. This network provides an example of expression behavior detected only at the single-cell resolution: the correlated and anti-correlated expression between cells. One can define 'noise regulons' , that is, groups of genes co-regulated within this expression heterogeneity, whose Spearman correlations alter Correlations that increase with perturbation are plotted with bold lines.

Although a number of disease-associated genetic variants have been shown to be linked to eQTLs  5  , in most cases no such correlation exists. We hypothesize that instead of influencing the average gene expression of a gene in a whole organism or a specific cell type or tissue, these variants might change the cell-to-cell variability, temporal dynamics or cell cycle dependence of gene expression at the single-cell level. Here we explore whether studying individual cells can begin to provide greater mechanistic insights into how SNPs quantitatively affect gene function, as opposed to just assaying their effects on average tissue expression. We refer to these variants as single-cell quantitative trait loci (scQTLs). To demonstrate the importance of cell-to-cell variability, we measured gene expression of selected genes in fresh, naive B lymphocytes from three individuals. Gene expression typically had much greater variability between cells within an individual than between individuals, and the distribution of gene expression values is very different between individuals for some genes. (Fig.  1a ). The currently understood reasons for this large cell-to-cell noise are thermodynamic, regulatory and cellular (Supplementary Fig.
- candidate for In conclusion, gene expression is not only different between individuals but also between cells. Genes display complex and heritable spatiotemporal expression variability, which we propose is largely masked without techniques that offer higher resolution. Using a clinically relevant model pathway, and the largest study known to us of individual cells to date (1,440 cells), we have provided evidence that this masking is likely to be important enough to require the inclusion of single-cell technologies as part of the standard genetic epidemiology toolbox.

Similar broadened peaks were reported for boronatelinked COFs (for example, COF-16Å, COF-14Å and COF-11Å) with amorphous side groups on the pore walls  15, 18  . Moreover, COF-11Å with propyl chains on the walls exhibited a broad halo peak at 2y from 12°to 22°. This peak appears significantly as the alkyl chain becomes longer from methyl to ethyl and propyl groups  15  . In the present CS-COF, the tert-butyl side groups cause a same effect on the XRD pattern.

In this context, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are a class of organic porous polymers that inherently combine p conjugation and porosity and provide unique structures and have been explored previously in applications  [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53]

Statement: The main challenge for harvesting hot carriers is the relatively short distance they travel before losing their excess energy to the lattice, typically on the picosecond time scale [citation 8].

Top 3 Chunk Texts:
- T he dynamics of hot electrons, those with energies perhaps hundreds of times greater than the available thermal energy, is central to understanding the properties of many electronic devices. For example, they contribute to leakage currents across CMOS transistors and may fundamentally limit their downsizing 
[1] [2] [3]  and they are intrinsic to solar cells, where high energy photons generate hot electrons that consequently generate a photocurrent  [4] [5] [6]  . Hot electrons can also, for example, be induced through plasmonics  [7] [8] [9]  and offer a route to instigate non-thermal chemical reactions  10  . Hot electron charge transport is thus the subject of major scientific research, both experimentally and theoretically  [11] [12] [13] [14]  . But the experiments are constrained by the ultra-short lifetime of hot electrons, typically 100 fs or less, and hence their corresponding transport length-scale of a few nm (refs 15,16). Direct pump-probe measurements with ultra-fast lasers typically provide little or no spatial information. Recently a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) coupled to terahertz radiation reported 0.5 ps and 2 nm resolution
- of 35 cm 2 s À 1 (ref. 50). Figure  3b  presents the temperature dependence of the nonlocal length-scale l. As the lattice temperature increases so does the nonlocal manipulation range. This further conforms to the diffusive transport model which, unlike ballistic transport, should increase with increasing temperature. The relationship also demonstrates the connection between the temperature of the crystal lattice and the measured electron dynamics. Hot electrons undergo several scattering processes to bring them into eventual thermal equilibrium with a crystal lattice. Typically carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering brings a population of hot carriers into a Fermi-Dirac distribution with some characteristic hot electron temperature T e within 10 s of fs (refs 43,51,52). We inject at currents of B100 pA and therefore have, on average, one-electron injected every 1 ns. Given the 180 fs lifetime of the electrons within the 2.0 eV state, we rule out carrier-carrier scattering. Further carrier-phonon scattering brings the mean energy of the electron distribution down to ultimately thermalize with the lattice. In our case, this carrierphonon scattering appears to occur within the high-lying 2.0 eV state since we have a temperature
- walk giving t s pt ep and therefore l / v Á t . Finally we simply set the power law relationship T e pT n . The curve fitted in Fig.  3b , lpT n / [2n BE (T) þ 1], gives a value of n ¼ 1.5±0.2 and demonstrates the lattice temperature dependence of the hot-electron transport. Further analysis would need a more detailed theoretical framework.

Methods
Experimental. Room temperature STM images were obtained using an Omicron UHV STM-1 instrument with RHK SPM1000 controller for the nonlocal manipulation and with a Nanonis control system with customized software for the local manipulation work. Low temperature nonlocal measurements were performed using an Omicron UHV LT-STM with Nanonis electronics. All images were obtained in 'passive'  38  constant-current mode with a tunnelling current of typically 100 pA and a sample bias voltage of þ 1 V. STM tips were electrochemically etched from 0.25 mm tungsten wire in 2 M NaOH solution. Insulating tungsten-oxide was removed from the tips by resistive heating in high vacuum.

In an oblate ejecta, thermalization will also be more efficient, which could have a small impact on mass measurements. Finally, we note that different nuclear mass models predict different rates of radioactive heating and differing f t tot ( ), which introduces additional uncertainties into our mass estimate. Radiation transport simulations in three dimensions with time-dependent thermalization models will better constrain M ej .

Late-time Light Curve
Late-time kilonova light curves may probe the history of rprocess nucleosynthesis in CO mergers. At ∼2 days after merger, fission ceases to be important, and a-and b-decay dominate the kilonova's energy supply. Energy from a-decay is transferred entirely to fast a-particles, which thermalize Sedonaʼs original thermalization scheme, which deposits charged particle energy but explicitly tracks the deposition of g -ray energy (lime curves); and the time-dependent f t tot ( ) from our numerical simulations (red curves). Light curves in the top and bottom panels adopt f t tot ( ) given by random fields and the FRDM mass model. To illustrate the effect of uncertainties in f t tot ( )

- efficiency. Furthermore, MOFs have great potential for the efficient direct dehumidification of air for air-conditioning purposes. For energy storage applications, focus should be especially on low desorption temperature applications, as MOF-water pairs are likely to be more competitive in this range. In this Review, however, no better performance with respect to commonly used inorganic salts has been identified in terms of energy storage capacity.

Future Perspectives
The focus of this Review is on the thermodynamic ("static") properties of MOFs in relation to allocation of heat and cold, as these are most abundantly available. For successful application, however, also the dynamics of the MOF-working fluid pair are important. The latter depends heavily on the macroscopic structure of the MOF chosen in the heat exchange application. Furthermore, MOFs are commonly synthesized and characterized on the (sub)gram scale, while actual heat pumps contain adsorbent material in the order of kilograms. To help put things into perspective, seven subsequent stages are defined that will eventually lead to application. Stage 0 -Stability: As the primary requirement, MOFs should be tolerant toward the working fluid of choice. This should be ensured before anything else. Stage 1 -Adsorptive properties: On the basis of primary
- MOFs might hold for thermochemical energy storage and open cycle desiccant air-conditioning are discussed concisely in section 7. A comprehensive summary and a detailed future perspective are both presented in section 8.

ADSORPTION MECHANISM
According to Canivet et al., three different mechanisms for water adsorption in MOFs can be distinguished:  76  adsorption on the metallic cluster, which modifies the first coordination sphere of the metal ion (irreversible); layer or cluster adsorption in pores (reversible); and capillary condensation in pores (irreversible). Note that reversibility here is defined by thermodynamics and is not meant to include irrevocable loss of structural fidelity (instability), which is discussed separately (section 3). As most MOFs consist of aromatic ligands, which are hydrophobic in nature, cluster adsorption is prevalent over layer formation when water is concerned. Clusters of water can be formed around three different types of sites. First, for MOFs that have coordinatively unsaturated sites (cus) on the metal ions after solvent removal, water can be clustered around those sites. As mentioned already, the first water molecule will then be irreversibly adsorbed, modifying the coordination sphere
- MOFs potentially offer advantages, as environmentally benign,  [477] [478] [479] [480]  room temperature,  [481] [482] [483] [484] [485] [486] [487] [488]  and even solvent-free synthesis  [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494]  protocols have been developed. In comparison, zeolite and zeotype synthesis often requires relatively expensive sacrificial organic templates,  [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] [500]  as is the case for the synthesis of SAPO-34 (AQSOA-ZO2)  [501] [502] [503]  and AlPO-5 (AQSOA-Z01/Z05).  [504] [505] [506]  In short, MOFs with water as working fluid show improved thermodynamic efficiency and volumetric adsorption capacity in comparison to commercially available benchmark materials for adsorption-driven allocation of heat and cold. MOF potential is further strengthened by the availability of low temperature, environmentally benign, and even solvent-free synthesis protocols and the possibility of synthesizing these materials directly on heat exchanger surfaces.

Among the existing classes of porous solids, crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)  [2]  are currently of great interest and importance due to their novel coordination structures, diverse topologies, and potential applications in the field of separation, gas storage, catalysis, or biomedical applications.  [3]  In spite of versatile advantages of porous MOFs, which include tailor-made pore structures and controllable porosity by change of organic ligands and metal subunits,  [2]  most MOFs suffer from a lack of hydrothermal stability.

Water sorption technologies are widely used commercially in many contexts, including industrial or indoor desiccant applications such as desiccant dehumidifiers, gas dryers, adsorptive air conditioning systems, fresh water production, adsorption heat transformation, etc.  [1]  In recent years, the potential for energy savings through improved efficiency has received increased attention, particularly as low-grade thermal energy or solar energy could be utilized. Currently, silica gel and zeolites are widely utilized commercially, often formed into corrugated honeycomb rotors.  [1]  As these sorbents typically must be heated above 150 °C during the desorption step, these sorbents are far from ideal in terms of energy consumption. There are additional issues with the level of dehumidification that these materials are able to achieve.  [1]  Improved energy efficiency requires advanced water adsorbents that can be regenerated together with the removal of a large amount of water vapor from humid conditions.

- for photoactivation (PA) experiments in vivo, the individual spines that acquired AS-PaRac1 were tracked, and were separately iconized from the day of AS-PaRac1 appearance (Fig.  2c  and i ). We noticed that persistence of synaptic AS-PaRac1 and the structural potentiation markedly varied among spines: some were preserved beyond 1 day after training (Fig.  2c , dendrite #1), while others disappeared (Fig.  2c , dendrites #2 and #3). Importantly, the structural potentiation and AS-PaRac1 labelling triggered during the 'Learning' period were more likely to be preserved than those triggered during the training-free period (Fig.  2j , 'Before' and 'After-1'). Consistently, longitudinal imaging of the structurally potentiated spines revealed that the majority of those with the retention of AS-PaRac1 for 24 h maintained structural potentiation for at least 48 h (Fig.  2k , green trace), while the structurally potentiated spines lacking AS-PaRac1 retention returned to the pre-potentiated state (Fig.  2k
- strongly correlated with the change in spine size upon training (Fig.  2f ). It is unlikely that the accumulation of AS-PaRac1 caused the potentiation or labelled the spines primed for potentiation such as for the 'tagged synapse'  35, 36  , because the initial quantity of AS-PaRac1 before learning (-1 day) did not correlate with the change in spine size after learning (Fig.  2g ). Analysis of AS-PaRac1 puncta in the dendritic shaft suggested that the majority of AS-PaRac1 signal was located in the dendritic spines, and the labelling of shaft synapses was negligible (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). When we set the threshold of AS-PaRac1 at 1 a.u. (Fig.  2f , green shaded area, 0 day), AS-PaRac1 detected spine formation and enlargement with sensitivities of 83 ± 7.9% and 69 ± 3.0% (mean ± standard error of the mean), respectively (Fig.  2h ), whereas labelling in other spine types was 2.3 ± 0.12%.

Contrary to the dual task group, spines potentiated during the 1st rotarod training were more likely to be repotentiated after the 2nd rotarod training in the re-training group (green, Fig.  l, n ), while re-potentiation was significantly less prominent in mice that did not perform the retraining task (home cage group) (Fig.  5i-k, l , n; Extended Data Fig.  7d, e ). Furthermore, newly potentiated spines, which were not potentiated in the first 2 days, were less abundant in the re-training and home cage groups compared with the dual task group (yellow, Fig.  5m, n ). These findings suggest that reorganisation of distinct synaptic ensembles is specific for each learning task.

Discussion
Current models of learning and memory suggest that structural plasticity of spines is the underlying mechanism of information storage in the brain. Nonetheless, clear visualization of spine structure in vivo requires the sparse labelling of neurons, and analysis of structural changes in spines is considerably laborious. In contrast, the AS-PaRac1 signal appears as fluorescence puncta, which allows the detection of potentiated

Statement: During prolonged depolarization, slow inactivation takes place by a mechanism that is not well understood, although it is thought at least in some cases that a conformational change of the selectivity filter underlies this process in Nav and Kv channels [citation 42].

- INTRODUCTION
One of the common properties of voltage-gated channels is their ability to inactivate in response to membrane depolarization. Two general mechanisms of inactivation have been characterized. The first mechanism is usually typified by relatively fast inactivation during a sustained depolarization, effected at the molecular level by a ''ball and chain''  (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)  or ''hinged-lid'' mechanism  (6) . Molecular mechanisms of this type of inactivation, called N-type inactivation, have been studied in detail in K and Na channels. The groups responsible for this type of inactivation are localized at the cytoplasmic side of the channel. For example, in Shaker K-channel, the N-terminal region of the channel plays the role of the ''ball'', which occludes the inner part of the pore after channel activation and thus closes the channel  (7) . A similar mechanism has been described for Na channels. In this case channel block is probably provided by the III-IV interdomain linker latched by a triplet of hydrophobic residues (IFM motif) to form a hinged lid  (8) . A second type of inactivation process, usually with significantly slower
- hinged lid  (8) . A second type of inactivation process, usually with significantly slower kinetics, has been observed in a number of channels  (9) (10) (11) . This type of inactivation is called C-type or slow inactivation, with yet a third inactivation process (P-type) also recognized in potassium channels  (12) . Although the detailed mechanisms of slow inactivation processes are incompletely understood, it is believed that rearrangement of the pore, rather than motion of a cytoplasmic region of the channel, is likely to play a central role  (13) (14) (15) . The importance of better understanding of slow inactivation in sodium voltage-gated channels is evident since its alteration is linked to such clinical disorders as periodic paralysis, myotonia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and long-QT syndrome, as recently reviewed by  Vilin and  Ruben  (16) . The prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel (NaCh-Bac) shows homology with eukaryotic voltage-gated channels though its sequence shows closer similarity with calcium channels than with sodium channels  (17) . NaChBac activates in response to membrane depolarization and then enters
- channels, as the number of N-terminal inactivation gates per channel was reduced by coexpression of an N-terminal deletion mutant with WT Shaker channels. Using tandem-linked dimers and tetramers, we did not detect any significant difference between inactivation of wild-type channel and the tandem concatemers. Hence, we conclude that, in contrast to N-type inactivation in eukaryotic channels, NaChBac inactivation does not involve either N-or C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of the WT monomer. Slow inactivation in sodium channels may involve a mechanism similar to that of C-type inactivation in potassium channels  (42) . C-type inactivation usually has slower kinetics than N-type and is sensitive to the mutations in the pore region. Similarly, in sodium channels, mutations that change the charge of groups located at the outer side of the selectivity filter change slow-inactivation kinetics  (43) (44) (45) (46) . For example, it was shown that, for the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel, substitution of a negatively charged residue (aspartate) for the alanine at position 1529 of domain IV in the selectivity filter favors ultraslow inactivation  (47) . We have found that

Two-step spin coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in the 1 μm long TiO 2 nanorod film results in J sc of 20.92 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 869 mV, FF of 0.55, and PCE of 10.02%, which is higher than the previous result for the similar TiO 2 length 9 because of the different coating procedure for the perovskite as mentioned previously. Compared to the ZnO  nanorod, the slightly lower PCE is due to lower V oc , associated with lower conduction band position for the rutile TiO 2 structure and/or enhanced recombination. It is also noted that absolute EQE is lower in spite of high J sc , and as a result, the integrated J sc of about 16 mA/cm 2 is far lower than the measured J sc at 1 sun illumination. In addition, APCE in Figure  9d  is

Although electron transport in ZnO was observed to be faster than that in TiO 2 ,  13  photovoltaic performances of ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells were inferior to those of TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cells. This might be due to nonoptimized ZnO nanorods. Here, we report high-efficiency ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells. Diameter and length of the solution-grown ZnO nanorods are controlled by varying the solution concentration and immersion time. PCE of 11.13% is achieved using 1 μm long ZnO nanorods (diameter of about 80 nm) in the absence of a compact TiO 2 blocking layer. The photovoltaic performance, especially external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectral response is compared between ZnO nanorods and TiO 2 nanorods.

There are two branches in developing perovskite solar cell; one is based on electron-injecting nanostructured oxide layer, and the other is based on nonelectron-injecting scaffold layer (meso-superstructure) or pn junction type planar structure.

- their derivative U373MG-IE1 cells. Likewise, depletion of RhoC led the cells to obtain an elongated, mesenchymal-like shape. The above observations are consistent with earlier studies depleting the same Rho isoforms both in prostate and breast cancer cells  [59, 62] . The overexpression of HCMV IE1 protein alone did not bring about any additional effect regarding the phenotype of the Rho knockdown cells, thus excluding any direct modulatory role of IE1 on cell morphology. The morphological changes induced in the glioblastoma cells after RhoA and RhoC depletion remained evident, even in the context of HCMV infection, despite the cytopathic effect caused by the virus, highlighting an imposing role Rho GTPases on cell shape. Although Rho GTPases have been shown to enhance malignant transformation and proliferation rate, RhoB is rather assumed as a negative regulator of these processes  [63, 64] . However, recent data have shown that RhoB expression is induced under conditions such as DNA damage, or treatment with growth factors or cytokines, suggesting that under particular circumstances, RhoB may favor towards human malignancy, including glioblastoma tumors
- under particular circumstances, RhoB may favor towards human malignancy, including glioblastoma tumors  [65, 66] . In the present study, we show that when RhoB is silenced, both parental and their derivative-IE1 cells show a reduction in spread area compared to the RhoA or RhoC knockdown cells, an effect which has attributed to subsequent reduction of total surface levels of b1 integrin  [67, 68] . Moreover, in the presence of HCMV, an increased number of cellular projections was formed, a phenomenon which has also been observed in HCMV infected primary HFF cells, particularly at the late stages of lytic infection  [49] . These findings further corroborate the idea of a key role for RhoB in the regulation of cell shape. Regarding to the proliferation rate of uninfected parental and IE1-expressing glioblastoma cells, the deficiency of RhoB or RhoC resulted in a significant inhibition of their proliferation state while RhoA deficiency reduced the cell growth of both U373MG and U373MG-IE1 cells to a lower degree. This difference reflects the evidence that RhoA regulates actin polymerization, cell adhesion and
- rate of non-infected U373MG-IE1 depleted RhoA, RhoB and RhoC cells was also decreased, however, in the presence of HCMV, these cells partially restored their increased motility rate in migratory state, in contrast to the Rho depleted parental glioblastoma cells. This acceleration in cell migration could be due to the expression of viral genes, including IE1 protein since earlier studies have demonstrated that the IE1 protein suppresses apoptosis and facilitates oncogenesis  [79, 80]  and more recent studies that positively contributes to the replication cycle of HCMV  [81, 82] . Taken together, our data suggest an important implication of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC GTPases in morphology, proliferation and motility of both uninfected and HCMV infected U373MG glioblastoma cells. HCMV has been shown to manage signaling networks in infected cells, including the activation of G proteins  [83]  in order to reserve infection and viral spread. In this study, we display that downregulation of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC proteins in infected glioblastoma cells decreases their proliferation rate and their migration status and

The successful integration of these properties correlates with the remarkable transport properties of the polymer and serves as a guideline for the rational design of next-generation polymers.

It should be noted that P(NDI2OD-T2) is a typical high-mobility n-type semiconductor with a low degree of energetic disorder (32) and both theoretical and experimental studies have shown intrinsically unbalanced electron and hole transport properties in low (i.e., diodes) and high (i.e., OFETs) charge density regimes  (33) . However, when fluorinated, high-k gate polymers are used as a dielectric insulator, both electrons and holes can be accumulated in the channel, leading to balanced ambipolarity  (34, 35) . The dielectric used here is a 600-nm-thick poly(trifluoroethylene) (PTrFE) film. Such a high-k, fluorinated gate dielectric can be dissolved in solvents that are perfectly orthogonal to the underlying semiconductor/insulator polymer blend, preventing the latter from rinsing off during deposition of the dielectric.

Atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope IIIa AFM; Digital Instruments) was operated in tapping mode to characterize the surface morphologies. UV-absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY-5000; Varian). All of the OFET electrical characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS in air. XRD Measurements. All measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 11-3. The incident X-ray beam was set at a grazing incidence (0.12°), which was chosen to be above the critical angle of the polymer film but below that of the silicon substrate, ensuring that the full thickness of the film was sampled. Samples were kept in a helium-filled environment during the measurements.

Relative to BTO and PZT, most  molecular ferroelectrics suffer from low spontaneous polarization (P s ), low melting temperature and phase transition temperature (Curie temperature, T c ), small dielectric constant, and weak piezoelectricity; their advantages include light weight, mechanical flexibility, and environmentally friendly processing as they are lead-free. Ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers  (12)  share some of the drawbacks of molecular ferroelectrics, which limits their applications. The recently reported croconic acid (6) has a high spontaneous polarization of around 23 mC cm -2 ; however, evidence for a ferroelectric phase transition, piezoelectric response, or ferroelectric domains has not been reported. By searching among organic compounds with a polar point group at room temperature and relatively high melting point, we found that diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPAC) is a ferroelectric with spontaneous polarization of 8.2 mC cm -2 (13). Here, we show that diisopropylammonium

These attributes make it a molecular alternative to perovskite ferroelectrics and ferroelectric polymers in sensing, actuation, data storage, electro-optics, and molecular or flexible electronics. F erroelectrics are multifunctional electroactive materials with a range of applications. Their temperature-dependent spontaneous polarization can be switched by electric field or mechanical forces (1-4), making them attractive for temperature sensing, data storage, mechan-ical actuation, and energy harvesting  (5) . They often exhibit tunable dielectric responses and nonlinear electro-optic effects  (6, 7)  and thus can also be used to manipulate electromagnetic waves  (1) . Ferroelectricity was originally discovered in Rochelle salt  (8)  in 1921 and later in a few other molecular systems  (9) , but the rapid development of ferroelectrics took place only after the discovery of ferroelectricity in perovskite barium titanate (BTO)  (10)  and lead zirconate titanate (PZT)  (11) .

The calculations suggest that the emergence of the spontaneous polarization is driven by a cooperative atomic distortion at molecular sites that breaks the mirror symmetry plane of each single DIPAB molecule along the b axis of Fig.  1A , resulting in an asymmetric arrangement of the charges.

Phase and amplitude mappings obtained with vertical PFM overlaid on three-dimensional (3D) topography (Fig.  4 , A and B) correspond well to each other, revealing a ferroelectric domain pattern with alternating bands of upward and downward polarizations separated by domain walls; no crosstalk with topography is observed. The piezoresponse is measured to be as high as 360 pm under only 1 V ac, comparable with most other ferroelectrics, thus confirming its excellent piezoelectricity.

Additional research at other isolated systems that have not undergone recently a major disturbance will help evaluate further whether these populations at Scott Reef experienced bottlenecks in 1998. Nevertheless, despite these differences between the two studies, our results not only support the finding of high levels of genetic differentiation by  Ayre & Dufty (1994) , but also extend our understanding of the processes underlying these patterns, by providing direct evidence that populations are subdivided on a scale of tens of metres.

Because of the resultant lack of direct, empirical data detailing patterns of larval dispersal or retention, researchers have had to draw on a wide range of indirect, interpretative and aggregative studies  (Thorrold et al . 2002; Largier 2003) . Analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation is one such method. Because gene flow reduces genetic divergence, population models are used to partition the genetic variation of a species among different geographical locations, and consequently assess the spatial scales over which they are reproductively closed. However, estimating recent patterns of migration from these models requires several simplified and often unrealistic assumptions  (Whitlock & McCauley 1999) . Alternatively, when highly variable DNA markers such as microsatellites are utilized, the units of analysis can be shifted from populations to individuals, allowing more detailed and direct estimates of gene flow at ecologically relevant scales  (Estoup & Angers 1998) .

Lastly, it is also important to note that  Ayre & Dufty (1994)  showed that genotype frequencies within sheltered lagoon sites on the GBR were typically in Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. This indicates that habitat type may affect mating or dispersal, and the fine scale heterogeneity detected here on the reef slopes need not apply in other populations. In addition to the prevalence of heterozygote deficits and the within-site spatial autocorrelation, our analysis of spatial genetic variation among sites also indicated that dispersal is predominantly local. All pairs of populations exhibited significant R ST or F ST , even though five of the six sites were separated by less than 30 km, and two of those were separated by only three kilometres. Consequently, our interpretation is that dispersal over the scale of kilometres to tens of kilometres is rare at the Scott Reef system.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the NiO-Ni structure (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). The as-made material exhibited mostly Ni 2 þ species on the surface with a weak shoulder peak at B853 eV from Ni 0 . On Ar ion sputtering of the surface, the detected Ni species were mostly Ni 0 with decreased amount of Ni 2 þ , consistent with NiO-decorated Ni nanoparticles. The Ni K edge spectrum of the sample recorded by X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) further corroborated the co-existence of NiO and Ni (Supplementary Fig.  2b ). Since Ni K edge probed deeper into the material, we could estimate the Ni/NiO ratio B73/27 by linear fitting of standard patterns.

- strong El Niño in 1998. Given recent improvements in the observed record  (13, 14)  and additional years of global data (including a record-warm 2014), we reexamine the observational evidence related to a "hiatus" in recent global surface warming. The data used in our long-term global temperature analysis primarily involve surface air temperature observations taken at thousands of weather observing stations over land, and for coverage across oceans, the data are sea surface temperature (SST) observations taken primarily by thousands of commercial ships and drifting surface buoys. These networks of observations are always undergoing change. Changes of particular importance include: (i) an increasing amount of ocean data from buoys, which are slightly differ-ent than data from ships; (ii) an increasing amount of ship data from engine intake thermometers, which are slightly different than data from bucket sea-water temperatures; and (iii) a large increase in land-station data that enables better analysis of key regions that may be warming faster or slower than the global average. We address all three of these, none of which were included in our previous analysis used in the IPCC report  (1) . First, several studies have examined the differences between buoy-and ship-based data,
- updated global surface temperature analysis that reveals that global trends are higher than reported by the IPCC, especially in recent decades, and that the central estimate for the rate of warming during the first 15 years of the 21st century is at least as great as the last half of the 20th century. These results do not support the notion of a "slowdown" in the increase of global surface temperature. tion of the ship correction had the largest impact on trends for the 2000-2014 time period, accounting for 0.030°C of the 0.064°C trend difference with version 3b. (The buoy offset correction contributed 0.014°C dec -1 to the difference, and the additional weight given to the buoys because of their greater accuracy contributed 0.012°C dec -1 . See supplementary materials for details.)

Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus
Third, there have also been advancements in the calculation of land surface air temperatures (LSTs). The most important is the release of the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI) databank  (14, 19) , which forms the basis of the LST component of our new analysis. The ISTI databank integrates the Global
- Reports
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report  (1)  concluded that the global surface temperature "has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past  15 years [1998-2012]  than over the past 30 to 60 years." The more recent trend was "estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend over 1951-2012." The apparent slowdown was termed a "hiatus," and inspired a suite of physical explanations for its cause, including changes in radiative forcing, deep ocean heat uptake, and atmospheric circulation changes  (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . While these analyses and theories have considerable merit in helping to understand the global climate system, other important aspects of the "hiatus" related to observational biases in global surface temperature data have not received similar attention. In particular, residual data biases in the modern era could well have muted recent warming, and as stated by IPCC, the trend period itself was short and commenced with a strong El Niño in 1998.

- methods for structure identification like Steinhardt parameters,  53  which supports the suitability of ACSFs for the distinction of different structural motifs. This application, which is very useful on its own, can be viewed as an intermediate step of the construction of the NN PES, since the proper characterization of the atomic environments is a mandatory ingredient for obtaining a reliable structure-energy relation in NNPs. Finally, it should be noted that NNs are currently experiencing an enormous boost in development under the name "deep learning," which is essentially based on very large NNs.

C. Gaussian approximation potentials and kernel methods
Gaussian approximation potentials (GAPs)  38, 54  are an important example for kernel-based ML potentials, which are obtained by combining a suitable structural descriptor and a kernel establishing the connection between structure and energy. In case of GAPs, the atomic energies E i in Eq. (  1 ) are interpolated in the bispectrum descriptor space using Gaussian process regression, 8 E i = N ref  n=1 α n e -0.5•  L l=1 [(bl-bn,l)/θl] 2 = N ref  n=1 α n e G(b,b
- for the construction of PES.  57, 58  Originally, SVMs have been developed for the classification of data into two groups with different properties by introducing a multidimensional hyperplane separating the data. As this hyperplane usually has a very complicated non-linear shape, the data is processed by a kernel substitution, which is in essence the mapping of the original data onto a higher-dimensional feature space, in which a linear separation is possible (see Fig.  3 ). In order to assign the data to real-valued properties like energies, instead of the original SVMs, an extension in the form of support vector regression (SVR) is used.  57  

E. Spectral neighbor analysis potential
The Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) introduced by Thompson et al.  59  represents a linear version of GAPs and is based on the same bispectrum components, which are now assumed to be related linearly to the atomic energies. The atomic energy of atom i in SNAP is then given as a linear combination of the K projected bispectrum components by  59  E i,SNAP = β α i 0 + K  k=1 β α i k • B i k (24)

Another example is the combination with a Coulomb matrix descriptor for representing the atomization energies of organic molecules by Rupp et al.  40  Here, the "distance" between two molecules is defined as d(M, M ′ ) = d(ϵ, ϵ ′ ) =   n |ϵ n -ϵ ′ n | 2 , (23) which is the Euclidean norm of the diagonalized Coulomb matrix.

  (Turcq et al. 1998 , Bush et al. 2008 , McMichael et al. 2012) . However, in recent decades, especially in Brazil and Indonesia, fire-return intervals have become decadal or even shorter in some forests  (Cochrane 2003 , Langner & Siegert 2009) . This increase in fire prevalence is primarily caused by an increase in ignition sources from agricultural activities that use fire as a tool for land management  (Laurance 2004 , Cardoso et al. 2008 , Morton et al. 2013 ) and an increase in forest flammability from other human activities, such as logging and fragmentation  (Cochrane 2001 , Siegert et al. 2001) . In addition, fires are often associated with severe droughts  (Chen et al. 2011) . For example, around 2.6 million hectares and 3.9 million hectares of forest were burned during El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in Indonesia and
- million hectares of forest were burned during El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in Indonesia and Brazilian Amazon  (Siegert et al. 2001 , Alencar et al. 2006, respectively) . Most of the predictions of fires associated to climate changes and human land uses in general, state that such events may occur more often in the coming years (e.g.,  Cochrane & Barber 2009 , Fu et al. 2013) , affecting not only Amazon forest, but also the hyper-fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, the interactions between human economic activities, climate change, and fire pose a serious threat for tropical forests. One of the consequences of this increase in fire-return intervals is an increase in the area of forests being subjected to repeated burns, which can alter forest structure and composition when compared to single burns  (Barlow & Peres 2008) . For example, when tropical forests are burned for the first time (or when fire-return intervals are millennial), it is a surface fire that usually burns just a thin layer of available fuels, such as the leaf litter and small fallen branches, as well as some small trees and saplings  (Cochrane et al.
- , Peres 1999 , Cochrane 2003) . While the effects of single fires on tropical forests are relatively well described, much less is known about recurrent fires. For example, single fires change the plant, bird and leaf litter ant species composition  (Barlow et al. 2002 , Barlow & Peres 2008 , Silveira et al. 2013, respectively) , reduce sapling, seedling and tree densities  (Clearly et al. 2006) , and cause substantial reptile mortality  (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998) . Existing studies on the impacts of recurrent fires are primarily focused on plants (e.g.,  Cochrane & Schulze 1999 , Barlow et al. 2003a ,b, Haugaasen et al. 2003a , Slik & Eichhorn 2003 , Toma et al. 2005 , Barlow & Peres 2008 , Slik et al. 2008 ) and secondly on birds (e.g.,  Barlow & Peres 2004 , Adeney et al. 2006 , Mestre et al. 2013) .

One study, in particular, found that highly concentrated LiTFSI-1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/DME electrolytes inhibited Li metal dendritic growth, but the Li plating/stripping CE was reported to be rather low (B71%)  24  . Lu et al.  11  reported that stable Li depositions can be obtained in the liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charging and discharging. Zheng et al.  8  used interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres to stabilize Li surface with a CE of B99% for 4150 cycles. However, no electrolytes have been reported to date that simultaneously overcome all of the challenges-dendritic metal deposition, low CE during Li deposition/stripping processes and poor rate performance-of Li metal electrodes. Most of the approaches reported to date mainly worked at relatively low current densities (o1 mA cm À 2 ), which are insufficient to meet the requirements for many practical applications (43 mA cm À 2 )  2, 8, 10,

Organic carbonate solvents and LiPF 6 salt have been widely used in Li-ion batteries due to their wide electrochemical stability windows and good compatibility with conventional intercalation electrodes. However, it is well established that the plating/stripping efficiency of Li metal in electrolytes with carbonate solvents such as propylene carbonate (PC) is poor and typically results in dendritic Li metal deposits and a low CE of only o80%  9, 12  . These carbonate solvents can be reduced during Li deposition process and form Li alkyl carbonate (ROCO 2 Li) species and, if trace water is present, may further react to form Li 2 CO 3 (refs 3,13,14). The SEI layers dominated by these components are usually not strong enough to accommodate the rapid changes in the morphology of the plated Li; hence, Li dendrites readily penetrate the SEI layer and lead to battery short circuits.

Electrolyte is one of the most critical elements that affects the cycling stability of Li metal anodes. Aurbach et al.  4  indicated that Li is thermodynamically unstable with any kinds of organic solvents. The interactions between electrolyte components and Li metal results in significant side reactions that not only lead to a low CE but also consume Li metal and the electrolyte. This produces a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film that may eventually grow into a thick layer, leading to high-impedancefailure of the battery instead of a short circuiting failure due to dendritic Li growth  7  . This phenomena becomes serious especially at high current densities  7  . Therefore, extensive studies have been conducted to understand how electrolyte formulations affect the cycling of Li metal electrodes  2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  .

- Introduction
The Neoproterozoic Era (1000-542 Ma) was an important interval subjected to dramatic climatic changes and biological evolutions in Earth's history. The Snowball Earth hypothesis suggested that the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets during the Neoproterozoic glaciation epoches  (Hoffman et al., 1998) . In the aftermath of glaciations, several lines of evidence, including iron chemistry and sulfur isotopic data from China, Canada, Oman and Australia, indicate stepwise oxygenation of the postglacial Ediacaran ocean (635-542 Ma), stimulating the evolution of early animal life  (Canfield et al., 2007; Fike et al., 2006; Komiya et al., 2008; Maruyama and Santosh, 2008; McFadden et al., 2008) . South China block provides a unique window to shed light on the early animal evolution where many biota, i.e., the Doushantuo and Weng'an biota, appeared during the Ediacaran Period (635-542 Ma)  (Chen et al., 2000; Li et al., 2008; Ohno et al.,
- overall anoxic (ferruginous) condition predominated over the deposition, although several short-term oxic and euxinic episodes interrupted. The superheavy δ 34 S Py values suggest a small size of sulfate reservoir during the interglacial epoch. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon.
- a lower sulfate concentration in South China rift basin compared to those in the Australian Mesoproterozoic Roper Basin. Multiple evidence indicate that the sulfate concentrations gradually increase over the Earth history  (Anbar and Knoll, 2002; Kah et al., 2004) . However, the low sulfate concentrations could exist in the Cryogenian ocean, indicating that the sulfur cycling must significantly change during the Cryogenian Period. During the most severe ice ages in Earth history (Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations), the riverine flux of sulfate to the ocean could decrease because the hydrologic cycle was diminished during the glaciations  (Hoffman et al., 1998) . When ocean anoxia developed as a result of extensive ice cover, a substantial portion of the marine sulfate reservoir would have been removed via bacterial sulfate reduction and iron sulfide burial. Generally, as the Sturtian glaciation ended and the hydrologic cycle was reinvigorated, marine sulfate levels should have increased through the interglacial interval due to the enhanced oxidative weathering of continent. Nevertheless, the sulfate reservoir after the glaciation could be still small due to an extremely low background of sulfate concentrations in association with the Sturtian glaciation. Subsequently,

A more focused analysis of snowball Earth ocean circulation was recently spearheaded in a series of papers by  Ashkenazy et al. (2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  and  Ashkenazy and Tziperman (2016) , who use a hierarchy of models to study the ocean circulation under a thick ice sheet. In  Ashkenazy et al. (2013)  and  Ashkenazy et al.

( , 2014) )  indicate interesting dynamics mostly in the equatorial region, where a vigorous overturning circulation with associated zonal jets develops within a few degrees of the equator. The rest of the ocean is unstratified, with vertical heat transport accomplished by parameterized convection and meridional heat and salt fluxes accomplished by parameterized eddy fluxes. The eddy transport of heat and salt in these noneddying simulations is parameterized by horizontal eddy
- Rather than presenting additional global-scale simulations, the focus of this paper is to improve our theoretical understanding of extratropical ocean dynamics in a snowball Earth ocean. What are the expected dominant dynamical processes? What are the energetic constraints? And what does this tell us about the largescale mean state and the transport of heat, salt, and other constituents? The results are expected to provide 1) some theoretical constraints on the ocean mean state and turbulent circulation during a snowball Earth event and 2) a basis for the formulation of ocean eddy parameterizations for use in future snowball world climate simulations. As in  Ashkenazy et al. (2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  and  Ashkenazy and Tziperman (2016) , the focus here will be on the so-called hard snowball scenario, where the entire ocean is covered by an ice sheet. Possible implications of the results for a ''Waterbelt''  (Hyde et al. 2000)  or ''Jormungand''  (Abbot et al. 2011 ) state with incomplete ice cover will be discussed in the conclusions.

Theoretical considerations
In this section, we will consider what the appropriate boundary
- While a weak meridional overturning circulation develops in this simulation, the meridional temperature gradient, stratification, and rms velocity all remain within 20% of the results obtained without a continental boundary (not shown). This result suggests that the presence of continental boundaries, which may support a large-scale mean circulation, is not likely to change the results qualitatively, as also found by  Ashkenazy et al. (2013) . However, various factors, such as domain size and geometry or spatially inhomogeneous geothermal heating, could substantially impact the large-scale circulation. The potential role of large-scale circulation in a snowball Earth ocean thus remains an interesting topic for future work.

c. The role of freezing and melting
As discussed in section 2, freshwater exchange associated with freezing and melting at the bottom of the ice sheet affects the buoyancy fluxes at the upper boundary. To analyze the effects on the flow field and mean state, and to test the predictions of section 2, this section discusses a simulation in which the ocean interacts with an ice sheet of fixed thickness H ice 5 1 km. The simulation uses a realistic seawater equation of state, following  Jackett and McDougall (1995) . The heat

Methods
Spatially patterned, heterogeneous catalyst metal films were prepared by photolithography and thermal evaporation, and atmospheric CVD was carried out for the synthesis of the monolithic graphene-graphite structures. After the metal layers were removed in solution, the monolithic graphene-graphite structures were transferred onto Si substrate with 285 nmthick SiO 2 . For the fabrication of monolithic top-gate FETs, 400 nm-thick SiO 2 layer was evaporated as a gate dielectric and graphite film (6-8 graphene layers) was transferred and patterned as top-gate electrodes. Current versus back-and top-gate measurements were conducted with a probe station (model 12561B, Cascade Microtech) with a computercontrolled analog-to-digital converter (model 6030E, National Instruments) and a variable gain amplifier (1211 current preamplifier, DL Instruments, Inc.).

This method enabled the fabrication of all-carbon based transistor arrays which were then transferred onto a 285 nm-thick SiO 2 on Si wafer for measurement of backgate response.

Indeed there are at least three ways in which the historical variation might be modified in the future. First, we may be approaching a saturation in the demand for light. Though this is difficult to imagine for the developing world, whose per-capita consumption of light is much lower than for the developed world, perhaps at least the developed world is approaching a saturation. Second, countering the first, new features associated with SSL may actually cause an increase in the demand for light. Third, apart from how the intrinsic demand for light is increased or decreased through SSL technology, guidelines and regulations aimed at efficient lighting system designs and light usage may nonetheless bring about a saturation. In this section we discuss these three possibilities in turn.

As has been discussed, at current levels of per-capita consumption of light, there is no evidence that we have reached a saturation in the demand for light. It is nevertheless an open question whether we will approach such a saturation in the future or whether per-capita consumption of light will continue to scale linearly with gdp/CoL. To understand
- of illuminances (lm m -2 ) as well as in terms of the per-capita illuminated areas surrounding people. Second, as discussed in section 5.3, even if intrinsic demand for light is not nearing saturation, non-legislated guidelines and legislated regulations aimed at efficient lighting system designs and light usage may nonetheless bring about a saturation. However, reasonable arguments can also be made that as a human society we are not near a saturation in consumption of light. As discussed in section 5.1, the average illuminance that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours and the average unshared illuminated area that a person is surrounded by may each yet be 10× or more from saturation. As discussed in section 5.2, new performance attributes associated with SSL have the potential to unleash new and unforeseen ways of consuming light. As discussed in section 5.3, guidelines and regulations may also have limited influence on light consumption.
- (Boyce 2003)). And there is a natural human tendency to gaze out (we value windows, not just because they are a portal for incoming light, but because of the view they afford (Boyce 2003)) into faraway spaces, even if we do not directly occupy those spaces. We conclude that it is possible that the average unshared illuminated area is nearing a saturation point, but plausible arguments can be made that the saturation point may yet be a factor 10× or greater away.

Demand for features beyond lumens
Although the primary demand for light is to illuminate our environment, there are many other features of light that are important to the consumer. Arguably, these features were just as important as decreased cost in the historical increases in consumption of light as one lighting technology gave way to the next. They therefore counter the possible saturations in consumption of light that were discussed in section 5.1. For example, the transitions within chemical-fuel-based lighting (e.g. from candles to oil lamps to gas lamps), and the final transition from chemical-fuel-based to electricitybased lighting, brimmed over with new performance attributes  (Schivelbusch 1988 ): increased cleanliness, faster turn-on and turn-off, greatly decreased

As reported previously  [10, 11] , the TFSI-doped PPy films swelled in acetone and shrank on drying  [13] . The PPy film was cut into a 10 mm × 2 mm strip and set in a one-compartment three-electrode cell described elsewhere  [8]  to measure change in length of the PPy strip by using a laser displacement meter (KEYENCE LE-4000) at typically 0.1 MPa load (under isotonic conditions) on applying potential. The definition of electrochemical strain of PPy actuators was change in length of the strip divided by the original length ( l/l 0 ). When the maximum strain was measured, potential was swept between -0.9 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + by using a potentio-galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research 263A) at 2 mV s -1 in H 2 O/PC solutions of LiTFSI.

The peak response rate was much larger than that (ca. 0.1% s -1 ) of other conventional PPy actuators  [2] , and that (3.2% s -1 ) of a PF 6 --doped PPy by using resistance compensation techniques  [14] . Ding et al.  [15]  prepared a tubular PF 6 --doped PPy with a Pt helical wire, exhibiting up to 13% s -1 strain rate and 5% strain, and we reported a PPy film with a compliant Au electrode at one side, prepared from an MB solution of TBACF 3 SO 3 , showed a peak strain rate of 8.8% s -1 and the maximum strain of 12.1%  [16] . Additional metal electrodes such as the Pt helical wire and the compliant Au thin layer decreased the voltage drop along the PPy actuators, giving fast response rates. Without any additional electrode or metal backing, the free-standing PPy film doped with TFSI

A PPy film, prepared similarly from an MB solution of TBATFSI, exhibited the maximum electrochemical strains of 20.1 and 26.5% when cycled at 2 and 0.2 mV s -1 , respectively  [10] , whereas the maximum electrochemical strain of 28.9% at 2 mV s -1 in an H 2 O/PC (60/40) solution shown in Fig.  2  did not increase even when cycled at 0.2 mV s -1 . This result suggests that the PPy-TFSI film driven in an H 2 O/PC (60/40) solution swelled enough to withdraw the maximum performance of the electrochemical strain even cycled at 2 mV s -1 . Large TFSI anions could not easily go into and out of the PPy-TFSI film which did not swell much in aqueous solution, and it would take more time to equilibrium. Fig.  3  depicts repeated electrochemical stretching of a PPy-TFSI film actuator, prepared from an MP solution of TBATFSI, driven in an H 2

However, fundamental study of thermal transport in halide perovskites has been significantly lacking despite its practical and fundamental importance. For HHP, very few experimental studies have been performed for thermal conductivity  (18, 19)  and an ultralow thermal conductivity value of 0.5 W•m -1 •K -1 has been reported for single-crystalline CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Computational study revealed that the main reason for the ultralow thermal conductivity of HHP is rotational motions of organic CH 3 NH 3 + ions  (20) (21) (22) . For instance, Hata et al. computationally demonstrated the critical role of CH 3 NH 3 + rotations by comparing results with A-site cations possessing different degrees of freedom, where the elimination of the rotational degree of freedom results in greater thermal conductivity by a factor of ∼2  (20) .

- In many networks, ranging from online communities to food webs, metabolic networks, and genetic regulatory networks, there are communities or modules that play distinct functional roles. A fundamental problem is to detect these communities and understand what role they play in the network's structure and dynamics. In social networks, these communities are often assortative, meaning that there is a higher density of connections within communities than between them, and many approaches to detecting these communities have been proposed (see e.g. 
[1] ). In other networks, however, these modules may consist of nodes with few connections to each other, but which connect to the rest of the network in similar ways. In this Letter we analyze a random generative model for sparse modular networks, known as the stochastic block model. It provides a useful playground for theoretical ideas and the analysis of algorithms, and is a popular model for functional modules in real networks. Using the cavity method developed in the physics of disordered systems  [2, 3]  we exactly analyze the detectability of these modules in the limit of large sparse networks. As a function of the parameters, we compute the phase diagram and locate the associated phase transitions. We distinguish between a detectable phase where it is possible to learn the model's parameters and the group assignments

The existence of a phase where a certain class of algorithms is unable to detect communities was previously predicted  [4] , but its location was only found approximately (and its size overestimated). In addition, unlike previous works based on finding a ground state, i.e., minimizing a cost function associated with a group assignment  [4, 5] , our analysis is more general as it relies on the properties of the entire Boltzmann distribution of group assignments. We also unveil a transition from an algorithmically "hard" phase, where, we believe, no polynomial algorithm for learning the groups and parameters exists, to an "easy" phase where polynomial algorithms do exist. In the latter phase, we show that Belief Propagation (BP)  [6]  works on large networks in essentially linear time as a function of their size. BP was previously proposed for community detection  [7]  without, however, the ability to learn the parameters of the underlying model. Our approach also provides a natural

- presented here are able to address questions about association between attributes and network relations based on a single cross-sectional dataset, the ultimate goal of much research in the social and biological sciences is to determine causal relationships using temporal network and attribute data. For example, sociologists are interested in determining whether students' friendships impact their health behaviors or whether health behaviors cause changes in their friendship networks  (Bauman and Ennett (1996) ).  Snijders et al. (2007)  and  Steglich et al. (2010)  propose methods for modeling the co-evolution of networks and behaviors using actor-oriented processes whereby actors dictate changes in their behaviors and outgoing ties. These methods focus on binary data, rely on method of moments estimation procedures, and are not applicable to cross-section datasets since they model network and attribute changes conditional on the first observation. A key advantage of the latent variable model approach here is that it warrants a formal testing procedure void of any model selection procedures. Extending these methods to allow for testing of causal relationships between a network and attributes is a future research area of the authors. A historically difficult problem not addressed here is how to select the number of multiplicative factors in the network model. In Section 6 we illustrated a procedure similar to the
- Introduction
A common goal in the analysis of network data is to characterize the dependence between network relations and a set of node-specific attributes. For example in recent years many studies in the social sciences have examined the relationship between individuals' friendship networks and their health measures, such as happiness, smoking and drinking behavior, and obesity (e.g.  Veenstra et al. (2013)  and references therein). Similarly in the biological sciences, scientists are interested in the relationship between how proteins interact and their biological importance (see  Butland et al. (2005)  for example). In each of these applications, parameter vector. The covariate vector x i,j typically includes terms for each attribute of the sender node i and receiver node j, as well as interaction terms measuring the similarity between the sender and receiver attributes. These interaction terms are frequently specified as the absolute difference between the attributes, an indicator of whether an attribute is the same for both the sender and receiver node (in the case of discrete attributes), or the product of the nodes' attributes. Examples of network models that can accommodate such a regression term are exponentially parameterized random graph models (ERGM)  (Frank and Strauss (1986) ,  Wasserman and Pattison (1996) ,
- be viewed as a reduced rank regression of the network relations on attribute interactions. This further motivates the joint model as a mechanism for parsimoniously characterizing attribute and network dependence. In Section 6 our proposed methodology in used to analyze data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. In a cross validation experiment, we demonstrate that predictions of missing attribute data can be improved by basing imputations on both observed network and attribute information rather than attribute data alone. We conclude with a discussion in Section 7.

Calculation of node-specific network factors
The latent space network models in  Hoff et al. (2002)  and latent variable models in  Hoff (2005)  and  Hoff (2009)  provide parsimonious representations of the patterns in a network using node-specific latent factors. These models have been shown to capture a variety of network dependence patterns such as homophily, transitivity, reciprocity, and heterogeneity in node sociability and popularity. We consider an extension of the model presented in  Hoff (2009)  that contains additive and multiplicative latent effects, as well as structure for within dyad correlation. This model is a mosaic composed of common network effects well established in the literature. Ultimately, we use

- (Otto-Bliesner et al, in preparation) further suggests that these new simulations are in general agreement with new tropical SSTs reconstructions from the MARGO project  (Kucera et al., 2005) . Systematic differences with earlier simulations are also found in the locations of the maximum cooling in the northern hemisphere over the ice-sheet, now prescribed from the ICE-5G reconstruction, which also translate to differences in the change in precipitation along the NH storm tracks. The change in SST gradient in the North Atlantic and the cooling over Eurasia is consistent with data  (Kageyama et al., 2006) . The LGM climate is characterised by a large-scale drying. In the tropical region, the African and Indian monsoons regions receive less precipitation than at present. These changes are very similar to the results found from PMIP1 SSTf and SSTc experiments, which suggests that the dominant factors contributing to the drying is the large-scale cooling which contribute to reduce evaporation over the tropical ocean, and the reduction of the inland moisture transport. For the Mid-Holocene, the new results confirm that the response of the ocean and sea-ice shape the changes in the seasonal cycle of the surface air temperature and
- SST gradient. Indeed Fig.  5  shows that for IPSL-CM4 MR, HadCM3M2 and MIROC3.2, the storm track activity partly follows the sea ice cover in the West Atlantic and the region of the larger SST gradient (red curve on the figure) in the East Atlantic and in the Pacific (Fig.  5 ). Since the cooling is not as large as in PMIP1 there is more water vapour in the atmosphere and evaporation still occurs along the path of the storm track, which explains the signature in precipitation.

Mid-Holocene
Changes are modest compared to those of the LGM, but reflect the sensitivity of the climate system to changes in the mean seasonal cycle of insolation. In particular, there is nearly no simulated change in annual mean temperature or precipitation for the Mid-Holocene, consistent with no change in global annual mean insolation. The major changes for this period compared to present correspond to an enhanced (reduced) seasonal cycle of temperature in the NH (SH). The continental warming favours the deepening of the JJAS thermal low over land, which intensifies the low level    winds and moisture transport from the tropical ocean to the continent, and thereby intensifies monsoon
- from the PMIP2 OA simulations suggest a reduction of about 20% to 42 % over Africa, except for one model that produces a slight enhancement of precipitation (+16%). Several PMIP1 SSTf simulations produce a larger reduction in precipitation, up to a 62%. The spread of PMIP1 SSTc results is even larger (10 to 80%). Over North India, similar conclusions can be drawn (Fig.  9d ). These results show that there is no specific differences between the different sets of simulations, suggesting that the change in precipitation is mostly due to the reduction in the mean water vapour associated to the large-scale cooling across the tropical regions, the reduction in evaporation, changes in the residence time of water in the atmosphere and to changes in water vapour advection  (Yanase and Abe-Ouchi, 2007) . 

African and Indian monsoons at the Mid-Holocene
The change in MH precipitation over West Africa has been a key focus of PMIP1. Figure  9a  shows that the response of PMIP2 OA MH simulation in JJAS ranges from 0.2 mm/d to 1.6 mm/d (5 to 140%). Both OA and OAV simulations

"Resonant" Circulation Regimes
Planetary wave influence on midlatitude weather in all seasons is a topic of active research. In the boreal midlatitude summer, amplifying interactions among standing (quasistationary) Rossby waves and fast-moving (free) Rossby waves of similar wavenumber (e.g., 6-8) have been proposed as being critical in producing long-standing heatwaves and other extreme events  [17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 37, 44] . This "quasi-resonance" of Rossby waves is associated with a double jet stream that traps Rossby waves within a latitudinal band, or waveguide  [17, 21, 45] . Such resonance creates highly persistent amplifications of the standing summertime ridge-trough (and associated meridional wind) pattern across the boreal hemisphere, decreasing summer weather variability during the period of resonance (Fig.  1 ). These resonance regimes comprise a special form of long-standing, hemispheric-scale atmospheric blocking events, which favor monthly anomalies like the 2003 European, 2010 Russian, and 2011 North American heatwaves  [17, 21,
- [56] , but model biases in the CMIP5 archive, such as too little blocking, remain  [57, 58] .

The Outlook for Changes in Potential Drivers
Beyond the potential for forced changes in the circulation regimes associated with boreal summer heat events discussed above, there are a number of other potentially related factors which could either directly or indirectly influence changes in heat event occurrence, magnitude, and duration from anthropogenic forcing. This subsection briefly explores how heat waves could be impacted by projected changes in four aspects of the climate system: land-atmosphere coupling, aerosols, differential warming of land and ocean, and tropical forcing. These four topics should not be considered comprehensive or fully independent; we briefly discuss their potential to influence heat events in the present and future.

Land-Atmosphere Coupling
Climate change will likely modify soil moisture  [59] -and by extension, heat waves-through multiple mechanisms. The surface temperature response to land-atmosphere coupling is strongest where soil moisture is moderate; thus, there is some expectation that future summertime drying of the midlatitudes and subtropics will increase the responsiveness of surface temperature to the transient circulation anomalies  [60] [61] [62] , associated with heat events. A recent single model
- [24] [25] . The proposed mechanism is that transient fast-moving waves slow and weaken in response to a weakened equator-to-pole temperature gradient from Arctic amplification  [21, [23] [24] [25] 47] , which reduces baroclinicity  [25, 43] . Coumou et al.  [23]  report that a combination of weaker waves with slower phase speeds has reduced eddy kinetic energy (EKE, a quantity of transient systems) by a striking two standard deviations, a departure climate models do not project under large radiative forcing until approximately 2100. Lehmann and Coumou  [24]  also report observed and projected decreases in summer storm tracks across the midlatitudes, finding that more than three fourths of the land area between 35 and 65 N has seen decreases in EKE in summer. The reduced EKE (and by extension reduced rain, clouds, and wind-induced mixing of air masses) would likely be associated with decreasing soil moisture, pointing to a potential landatmosphere feedback (discussed in the "Proximate Drivers and Land-Atmosphere Feedbacks of Heat Events" section) that could exacerbate and/or lengthen heat events

Composition analysis with EDX, XPS, and ToF-SIMS have revealed iodine diffusion leading to an inhomogeneous lead/iodine ratio, with marked composition differences between in the capping perovskite layer and the one embedded into the mesoporous TiO 2 layer. It is then crucial to establish whether the constituent elements of the perovskite are present in the desired perovskite form (i.e., CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) or in other forms (PbI 3 or PbI 2 , etc.) as this would allow to compare the perovskite conversion efficiency associated with the each conversion method and environment and determine ionic diffusion testified by the presence of strong signals from iodine fragments.

In sample B, R B is fairly stable within the perovskite layer, indicating an efficient and homogeneous perovskite conversion which well fits with the high PCE values. The raise of R B indicated some iodine diffusion toward the HTM. In sample C, similarly to sample B, R C displays a constant value in the perovskite layer.

CONCLUSIONS
This work has explored in detail the morphology, composition, and interfaces in PSCs deposited by different methodologies and external conditions by combining multiple advanced characterization tools. In particular, the single-step and double-step deposition routes have been investigated. By STEM analysis, in the double-step deposition procedure the perovskite

When the profile is at the interpenetrating region between the perovskite and the mesoporous TiO 2 (etch time between 3000 and 5000 s) the Pb and I at % drops to roughly half of their value in the capping perovskite layer. Interestingly, the I/Pb ratio is about 1.4 in the capping perovskite layer (consistent with EDX STEM quantification), whereas it is close to 2 within the TiO 2 scaffold. The presence of regions of constant Pb/I ratio is an indication that in our conditions preferential sputtering does not significantly affect the I/Pb value.  Interestingly, the I/Pb ratio is always lower than the theoretical value of 3. As it will be clarified by the ToF-SIMS analysis, this difference is thought to rely on the presence of "free" iodine and precursor elements not converted into the perovskite material (such as PbI, PbI 2 , ...).

It would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. Likewise bacteria within the Bacteroidetes are known to be chemoorganotrophic and especially proficient in degrading various polymers and complex substrates in media such as cellulose, chitin, and pectin  [33] . It has been reported earlier that the members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia have been shown to make up 1 to 10% of the bacterial 16S rRNA in soils, although most members of this phylum remains uncultivated. Some members of this group are among the most successful human pathogens, others are abundant soil microbes, and others still are of major importance for the marine nitrogen cycle and hold much promise for sustainable wastewater treatment  [34] .

Statement: Based on these results, which indicated that the maize seedlings select a subset of species present in bulk soil, we used host-mediated microbiota selection as an aid in obtaining a greatly simplified synthetic community that was representative of the more complex initial communities and able to colonize roots. Such approaches have been recently proposed and applied to improve plant and animal health [citation 64].

- under continuous light at 25°C for 35 days, which constituted a single ecosystem generation. The phenotypic trait of above-ground plant biomass was measured for each container by clipping the plants at the soil surface and drying to constant weight at 80°C before weighing. At the beginning of the experiment, a sample of unsterilized soil from a single source (a hemlock-hardwoods forest located on the Binghamton University campus) was made into a slurry by adding sterilized water, and to provide the biotic component of the soil ecosystems, a controlled amount of soil was added to the sterile soil within the containers before adding plant seeds. During the course of the experiment, the soil from the selected units of each generation was used to inoculate the units of the next generation. The plants were not a part of the evolving ecosystems because seeds were added from an external source every generation. Plant biomass was merely the phenotypic trait of the soil ecosystem that was used as the basis of selection. Inoculation of microcosms, planting, and harvesting were carried out under sterile conditions so as to minimize contamination of the microcosms. Two sets of high and low lines were initiated in which the size of the soil inoculum differed by two orders of magnitude
- An ecosystem is defined as the interactions of species with each other and their physical environment. Because two of the phenotypic traits (pH and degradation of the toxic compound 3-chloroaniline) are properties of the physical environment and the third trait (aboveground plant biomass) is likely to be mediated through effects on the physical environment, our experiments qualify as selection at the ecosystem level.

Materials and Methods
All selection experiments require a population of units, a phenotypic trait that forms the basis of selection, and a method for creating a new generation of units from the selected units of the previous generation. In the soil ecosystem experiments, the units were transparent containers designed to grow plants under microbially controlled conditions (GA-7 acrylic vessels and couplers; Magenta Corporation, Chicago). Each container was filled with 85 g of well-mixed potting soil that was dried and rewetted with 25 ml of water and sterilized by autoclaving within the containers. Approximately 50 surface-sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (strain Landsberg erecta) were added to each container, and the plants were allowed to grow under continuous light at 25°C for 35 days, which constituted a single ecosystem generation. The
- (thousands of species and thousands of genes within each species) for ecosystems with these two properties.  Research Design and Criticisms. In designing our research, we decided to maximize the number of experiments at the expense of replication within each experiment. Thus, we included two ecosystems (soil and water), two phenotypic traits (plant biomass and pH), two inoculum sizes (6.0 g and 0.06 g), and two methods of forming offspring ecosystems (mixing the parent ecosystems vs. keeping them separate, roughly analogous to sexual and asexual reproduction). However, each experiment consisted of only a single high line, a single low line, and a sterile control line. Lack of replication means that we can be statistically confident that the high and low lines diverged in two of the three experiments, but we cannot say, for example, that ecosystemlevel selection is more effective when 6.0 g rather than 0.06 g of soil is used as an inoculum. Replicated lines within each experiment would be required to make this and other statements. This research strategy was justified by the fact that ecosystemlevel selection had never been attempted before and was regarded by many of our colleagues as a risky venture. It therefore seemed wise to try a number

- The spatial organization of complex natural microbiomes is critical to understanding the interactions of the individual taxa that comprise a community. Although the revolution in DNA sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic-level information, the biogeography of microbiomes is almost entirely uncharted at the micron scale. Using spectral imaging fluorescence in situ hybridization as guided by metagenomic sequence analysis, we have discovered a distinctive, multigenus consortium in the microbiome of supragingival dental plaque. The consortium consists of a radially arranged, nine-taxon structure organized around cells of filamentous corynebacteria. The consortium ranges in size from a few tens to a few hundreds of microns in radius and is spatially differentiated. Within the structure, individual taxa are localized at the micron scale in ways suggestive of their functional niche in the consortium. For example, anaerobic taxa tend to be in the interior, whereas facultative or obligate aerobes tend to be at the periphery of the consortium. Consumers and producers of certain metabolites, such as lactate, tend to be near each other. Based on our observations and the literature, we propose a model for plaque microbiome development and maintenance consistent with known metabolic, adherence, and environmental considerations. The consortium illustrates how complex structural
- abundance may result from real differences between individuals, fluctuations within a single individual over time, or a combination of the two. Whatever its cause, the lack of a consistently abundant microbial "core" has led to the idea that perhaps it is not organisms but genes and functions that are conserved within the microbiome, distributed across a variety of organisms whose identities are irrelevant. The discovery of hedgehog consortia argues against this idea, at least for some microbiomes. The consistency of the composition and structure of the hedgehog across many individuals suggests that organisms are highly relevant to understanding the roles, organization, and dynamics of the members of the consortium. We suggest that it is neither necessary nor desirable to disregard taxonomy and reduce the microbiome to a collection of genes or metabolites unmoored from their source organism. Instead, we suggest the converse, that an understanding of the ecology and physiology of the organisms in the consortium will provide an organizing principle for understanding and interpreting metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. The consortium that we have described is composed of organisms of not only different species but nine different genera classified into eight families in five phyla. Thus, it is a consortium not of close relatives but of highly disparate organisms. The intimate association of widely diverged taxa may be
- not of close relatives but of highly disparate organisms. The intimate association of widely diverged taxa may be a general property of spatially organized microbial consortia.  Darwin (41)  was the first to recognize that the "struggle for existence" was most severe between closely allied forms and that "divergence of character" would support the greatest amount of life. In his words, "the advantages of diversification of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders"  (41) . Although our imaging studies to date have mostly been restricted to genus-level analysis, we suggest that the members of each genus are not interchangeable with one another. Future, more taxonomically refined analyses will reveal which representatives of each genus participate in hedgehog structures. The likely identity of these representatives can be inferred from sequencing data and is generally small in number, as noted above for genus Corynebacterium with only two major oral species.

In all cases, former agricultural land (i.e. cropland plus grazing land area) would become available for nonfood purposes (afforestation or bioenergy crops) if stocking densities on grazing land were increased to higher, but still sustainable, levels; the latter were derived from spatially explicit data on the productivity of grazing areas (see  Erb et al., 2009 Erb et al., , 2012a,b;,b; Haberl et al., 2011) .

Because many ecosystem services are lost on such conversion, it is apparent that future increases in food supply need to be met without large increases in agricultural area, i.e. to derive more agricultural products from the same area  (Godfray et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010; Smith, 2012b) . The main means of intensifying crop production will be through increased yields per unit area together with   (Smith et al., 2010) . Put another way, had the increases in yield of the last 60-70 years not been achieved, almost three times more land would have been required to produce crops to sustain the present population; land that does not exist except by using some that is unsuitable for cropping. So some form of sustainable intensification of food production will be required  (Garnett & Godfray, 2012) .

Such options reduce demand for land, but there may be trade-offs with other ecological, social and economic costs  (IAASTD, 2009 ) that need to be mitigated  (Tilman et al., 2011) . Increases in yields may also increase consumption  (Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011;

Statement: India, for example, has strictly regulated foreign direct investment into multibrand retail (the Indian equivalent to large supermarkets). Still, there is evidence of an “emerging supermarket revolution in India” [citation 37], driven by domestic capital.

Top 3 Chunk Texts:
- the most heated debate related to retail at this very moment (mid 2011) is whether multi-brand retail FDI should be liberalized. We do not take a side in this debate. We simply note what our findings suggest: whether or not retail FDI is liberalized, modern retail diffusion looks on the path to continue, even at its rapid pace of several times GDP growth, for some time. The "drivers" on the demand and investment supply side do not look to diminish. FDI liberalization may accelerate it, would probably (by definition) multinationalize it, may increase the overall level of retail "development" by bringing more international experience and technologies to bear; it would probably (as it has in China and elsewhere) create more "procurement doors" for two way flows of imports of products, and exports of Indian agricultural goods. Researchers focussed on food industry, agricultural economics, and agribusiness have a rich agenda before them to explore empirically, with rigorous surveys, the impacts on supply chains, and their actors of the emerging supermarket revolution in India.
- it is surprising that such a rapid take-off has occurred spurred nearly only by domestic capital -not by FDI, as "multi-brand" retail FDI has not been liberalized. Part of the reason is also that the rapidity of the rise seems itself linked to the nature of the transformation -the strategies of market penetration. Finally, part of the interest of the suddenness and size of the take-off is the policy/political reaction -surprise and fear as well as sudden hope, depending on the quarter -that the rise has evoked. The political reaction is itself not unique (in fact  Reardon and Hopkins, 2006  show that such reactions were in fact much stronger in the USA in the early decades of supermarkets than anything one observes in developing countries -including India -today). Nor is it surprising that supermarkets have taken-off quickly in the "traditional retail setting" of India; we observe that Indians tend to somehow see their traditional retail setting as unique (relative to other developing countries perhaps, and to the USA or Europe), when in fact it is similar, as is the context, to much of Asia (such as dense cities, many small farmers, etc.) that has had a supermarket revolution, and the traditional retail system and local consumption habits themselves

The third surprise is the nature -in several ways unique -that the Indian retail transformation has taken in these early stages. One we already mentioned: the overlap of the modern-private retail take-off with the coexistence of substantial state and coop chains. But several others stand out, in two sets. The first set is the largest, and are ways in which Indian modern retail has done things that other developing country retailers have done -but done them much earlier or in a different sequence than others have done: early expansion into tertiary cities and poor consumers; early penetration of fresh fruits and vegetables retail; early expansion into rural areas; early format diversification into small and even mobile formats to penetrate dense urban areas.

To evaluate the charge redistribution induced by the Li incorporation in the host matrix, the charge gain of the atoms adjacent to Li was calculated. As shown in Figure  2 , the charge distributed to Si first NNs is the highest among the three host lattices, but with the increasing SiÀLi distance, this amount also decreases most rapidly; from 0.24e (1st NNs) to 0.1e (2nd NNs) to 0.01e (3rd NNs) while there is no noticeable indication of charge gain beyond the third NNs.

In this paper, we first examine the structure, stability, Li diffusion, LiÀLi interaction, and how the host lattice M (M = Si, Ge, and Sn) is affected by Li insertion using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The group IV elements are found to adopt the diamond crystalline structure, which allows a comparative study on the nature of Li in different host materials, but the same diamond structure. Although other allotropic structures are found for Ge and Sn (β-Ge and β-Sn 18 ), they do not serve a particular interest in this study. We then examine the structure, energetics, and mechanical and electronic properties of LiÀM alloys. The structural evolution in terms of Li content is analyzed for both crystalline and amorphous phases, and the relative stabilities of the alloys are evaluated based on their mixing enthalpies. As the structure undergoes considerable changes when alloyed with Li, variations in elastic constant and bulk modulus are also analyzed to assess the relationship between the structure and the mechanical properties.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
The calculations reported herein were performed based on density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation
- by Li and M atoms accordingly to achieve desired composition ratios; the replacement sites were carefully chosen such that M and Li were well-dispersed. The model structures, each containing 64 Li and M atoms, were annealed at 1500 K for 2 ps with a time step of 1 fs and then rapidly quenched to 300 K at a rate of 0.6 K/fs, along with volume optimization. Here, the temperature was controlled via velocity rescaling. The annealing temperature was assured to be far above the alloy melting point (∼1000 K) to accelerate the melting process and to eliminate any memory effects from the initial configuration. This approach can provide reasonable LiÀM amorphous structures at a significantly reduced computational burden compared to starting with crystalline initial configurations.

- that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins. The proportion of regulated proteins closely paralleled the total number of phosphorylations of nuclear proteins. As expected, proteins annotated as extracellular were significantly underrepresented in the phosphoproteome. Although there is evidence of a mitochondrial phosphoproteome  (Pagliarini and Dixon, 2006) , proteins annotated as mitochondrial by GO were underrepresented, as were plasma membrane proteins. As membrane proteins are often of low abundance and we did not specifically enrich the plasma membrane in this analysis, we are less likely to identify phosphorylation events associated with them. Conversely, proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, which are generally of higher abundance, were almost twice as likely to be detected in the phosphoproteome as compared with their proportion in the database, and they accounted for an even higher share of the regulated sites. This illustrates that, at the current state of technology, our phosphopeptide screen is still not comprehensive. We may also miss certain phosphopeptides that are either too small or too large in mass to be readily measurable in our current MS setup. Therefore, absence of a phosphorylation site from our data set does not necessarily mean that it does not exist. Given that we have observed 2,244
- previous studies generally used lower-resolution MS and different experimental conditions, this is a relatively high value. As in the case of SwissProt, close to 90% of our data are novel compared with these previous studies. Taken together, our data suggest that, despite several decades of research into phosphorylation, most in vivo phosphorylation sites have still not been detected.

Phosphoproteome Dynamics
EGF signaling begins with activation of the EGF receptor and extends through a cascade of downstream kinases to mediate the increased phosphorylation of a large number of substrate proteins. The overall levels of phosphorylated proteins within a specific cellular compartment are also affected by other processes, including dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, protein degradation via ubiquitination, and translocation of the protein to another subcellular location. Our experiment measures the net effect of all these diverse processes that collectively regulate the dynamic phosphoproteome. To search for patterns in the time profiles of the regulated phosphopeptides, we explored several clustering techniques. Clustering algorithms have been applied extensively to the analysis of gene-expression data, including time-series data sets. We found fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to be better suited to our analysis than hard partitioning algorithms, such as
- therefore be underrepresented in the phosphoamino acid analysis. Another contributing factor may be the fact that pY is less stable in phosphoamino acid analysis than pS/pT, whereas we have found no evidence that the phosphopeptide enrichment method discriminates between these modification types. We next averaged the time profiles of the upregulated phosphorylation sites and normalized them to their maximal fold change. Figure  2D  shows that, on average, dynamic changes in tyrosine phosphorylation occur much faster and from a lower basal level compared to serine/ threonine phosphorylation. We found phosphorylation sites on a wide variety of proteins, and about half the proteins contained more than one site (Table  S2 ). Figure  2E  shows a Gene Ontology (GO)  (Zeeberg et al., 2003)  analysis of the in vivo phosphoproteome. GO localization information existed for 1,589 of the 2,244 phosphoproteins. Almost half of the phosphorylation events occurred on nuclear proteins, whereas only one-third of all proteins in the database were assigned as nuclear by GO, indicating that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins.

In epidemiological studies of joint diseases, where results from different observers are to be compared, it is common to estimate the degree of variation between the observers;l'Z if the variation is small, then the conclusions drawn from such studies will have more credibility than if it is great.

In the presence of ride time constraints, using dynamic programming would be difficult since the states of the dynamic programming algorithm would have to take into account the individual ride time of each user. Future work will concentrate on the development of more refined separation procedures for the various types of inequalities introduced in this paper. for U 1 must visit node n + i 2 before visiting node i 1 . In addition, this path must appear immediately before the arc (i 1 , n + i l ) in the solution. Now, for k = 2, . . . , l -1, the path for U k must appear before that for U k-1 in
- variables ensures that node i will be visited before node n + i for every user i. Finally, inequalities (10) bound the duration of each route while (  11 ) and (  13 ) impose time windows and capacity constraints, respectively. This formulation is non-linear because of constraints (  7 ) and (  8 ). Introducing constants M k ij and W k ij , these constraints can, however, be linearized as follows: B k j ≥ B k i + d i + t ij -M k ij (1 -x k ij ) ∀i ∈ N, j ∈ N, k ∈ K (15) Q k j ≥ Q k i + q j -W k ij (1 -x k ij ) ∀i ∈ N, j ∈ N, k ∈ K. ( 16 ) The validity of these constraints is ensured by setting M k ij ≥ max{0, l i + d i + t ij -e j } and W k ij ≥ min{Q k , Q k + q i }. These constraints are very similar to the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin subtour elimination constraints for the TSP  (Miller et al., 1960) . One can reduce the number of variables and constraints
- ≤ i ≤ 2n, and P i = -∞, otherwise. This definition of the forward time slack generalizes that of  Savelsbergh (1992)  for the TSP with time windows.

Variable fixing
The identification of incompatible user pairs can also be used to permanently assign users to specific vehicles. If the fleet of vehicles is homogeneous, one can can create a graph G ′ = (N ′ , E ′ ) where N ′ = {1, . . . , n} and E ′ contains an edge (i, j) if i and j are incompatible users. Given a clique in G ′ , each user in the clique can be assigned to a different vehicle. In addition, if user i is assigned to vehicle k, constraints can be added to the formulation so as to forbid the assignment to vehicle k of users that are incompatible with i. Finding a clique of maximum cardinality in G ′ may be very time consuming when n is large. In our implementation, we thus use a greedy heuristic described by  Johnson (1974) .

It is an integral (Fock) operator for hybrids but a differential operator [citation 31] for meta-GGAs, the same operator for occupied and unoccupied one-electron states.

- meta-GGA gKS gaps and GGA KS gaps, which are not the same quantity. It is unclear whether the KS gap itself is improved, or just the gKS gap is improved. One needs to do meta-GGA calculations in the KS scheme to be able to have a systematic comparsion of the KS band gaps between meta-GGA and GGA. In the gKS formalism for an orbital functional such as a meta-GGA or hybrid functional, we find the "optimal variational potential", a non-multiplicative self-adjoint operator that minimizes the energy functional with respect to the orbitals. This potential is a differential operator for a meta-GGA and an integral operator for a hybrid functional. In the KS formalism for an orbital functional, we find the optimized effective potential (OEP)  15, 16  , the multiplicative xc potential that minimizes the energy. The OEP meta-GGA yields the KS gap of the meta-GGA, which can be compared directly with the GGA KS gap. With the OEP, the meta-GGA xc potential also becomes comparable with that of the GGA. The OEP meta-GGA has been studied only in finite systems previously.  17, 18

Comparison of the ∆ XC 's of meta-GGAs with the exact ∆ XC is impossible for periodic systems, since no exact KS potential is available. However, Ref. 62 provides an OEP of the GW method of bulk Si, and its ∆ XC can be seen as a good approximation to the exact ∆ XC . The ∆ XC of bulk Si in Ref. 62 is 0.58 eV, which is larger than that of all the meta-GGAs in Table  I . This is not unexpected because the meta-GGA's tested in this work are not exact for I -A in a solid.

The gKS meta-GGA requires a larger real-space integration grid than GGA  63  , and this is caused by the sharp variation in regions far away from nuclei of quantities containing τ , such as z = τ W /τ used in TPSS, and α = (τ -τ W )/τ 0 used in

To ascertain whether sporozoites could recall DC-primed CTLs, we reversed the order of immunizations and repeated in vivo killing assays. L3-specific killing in mice primed with L3 peptide-pulsed DCs was boosted by a secondary sporozoite immunization (Fig.  4E ). In all of these studies, CSP-specific responses could be potently triggered by any combination of DC and/or sporozoite immunizations. To test whether heterologous prime-boost immunization could overcome the poor L3 response in sporozoite immunized mice, we primed mice with L3 peptide-pulsed DCs or GAP sporozoites and boosted with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) expressing the L3 epitope (Lm-L3). Similar to the behavior of CSP-specific cells following multiple sporozoite immunizations, these heterologous prime-boost approaches expanded the population of activated (CD11a HI CD62L LO CD44 HI ) L3-specific T cells by 0.74 or 1.67 log

The lack of L3 boosting by repeated sporozoite exposures may be emblematic of a phenomenon affecting other liver-stage parasite antigens as well. Heterologous prime-boost approaches are being used for malaria vaccination-challenge studies in mice and humans  (49) . Our findings make the case for heterologous approaches at the antigen discovery phase as well. By inducing a broad immune repertoire, we may be able to generate responses capable of eradicating all malariainfected hepatocytes, including those missed by CSP-or other sporozoite-limited responses.

Late Liver Stage Antigens. Heterologous prime-boost studies presented above suggested that functional memory L3 CTLs were formed by priming with sporozoites. To explain the lack of L3 CTL boosting in response to subsequent sporozoite immunizations, we hypothesized that L3 antigen was insufficiently presented during secondary or later sporozoite immunizations because the developing adaptive immune response constrained the parasite such that L3 expression was suppressed during later immunizations. To test this hypothesis, we immunized mice one to three times with 2 × 10 4 P. yoelii GAP at 1-or

Statement: Although there have been instances of sexual and perinatal/vertical transmission and the potential for transmission by transfusion is present [citation 13], ZIKV spreads primarily through infected Aedes mosquitoes.

- blood has not been investigated. Since other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion  [4] , several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1,505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.

Background
ZIKAV, an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus  [5] , was first isolated in 1947 from a monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda  [6] . Sporadic human Zika fever cases have been reported since the 1960s  [7] . The first documented outbreak outside Africa and Asia occurred in 2007 in the Yap State, Micronesia, in the North Pacific, where Zika fever was characterised by rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia  [8] . ZIKAV has been isolated from several Aedes mosquito species, notably including Ae. aegypti  [9]  and Ae.
- syndrome following blood donation
Blood donors positive for ZIKAV were contacted retrospectively by telephone to investigate the occurrence of 'Zika fever-like syndrome' (rash and /or conjunctivitis and/or arthralgia) after their blood donation. Of the 42 donors tested positive by RT-PCR, 11 declared that they had a Zika fever -like syndrome from 3 to 10 days after they gave blood.

Discussion
The main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75% for DENV  [17]  and West Nile virus (WNV)  [18] . For ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections. Arbovirus transfusionderived transmission has been reported principally for WNV  [19] , DENV  [20]  and chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  [21, 22] . For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high  [21, 22] . During the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007)  [21]  and in Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean
- mosquito species, notably including Ae. aegypti  [9]  and Ae. albopictus  [10] . Ae. aegypti is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and Ae. albopictus is now established in many parts of Europe, especially Mediterranean countries  [11] . Recent reports of imported cases of ZIKAV infection from south-east Asia or the Pacific to Europe  [12]  or Japan  [13]  highlight the risk of ZIKAV emergence in parts of the world where the vector is present.

Sample collection
According to the procedures of the blood bank centre of French Polynesia, all blood donors have to fill in a pre-donation questionnaire and have a medical examination before blood donation. Blood is taken only from voluntary donors who are asymptomatic at the time of donation. A signed informed consent statement was obtained from all blood donors and publication of data related to ZIKAV testing was approved by the Ethics Committee of French Polynesia (reference 66/CEPF). ZIKAV nucleic acid testing (NAT) of samples of all donations was implemented routinely from 13 January 2014. In February, samples of donations collected from 21 November

- pathways involved in cardioprotection will aid in the characterisation of these agents  [4] . The advent of newer and possibly more potent forms of the necrostatins will also assist in this process  [22] . In conclusion, as discussed by Degterev et al.  [12]  necrosis and apoptosis play key roles in a variety of pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction, and the identification of compounds such as the necrostatins which may target the proposed alternative death pathway, necroptosis, may lead to the development of more effective therapies. Our data are the first to indicate that necrostatin is protective against I/R injury in the myocardium, possibly via mechanisms other than those that are generally accepted as being involved (i.e. apoptosis and necrosis)  [23] . It should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies. Thus, we intend to carry out further, more probing investigations, including in human tissue,  (1)  to obtain information regarding the therapeutic window for necrostatins, (2) to establish if necroptosis is, indeed, a feature of the degenerative changes occurring in myocardial infarction, (3) to determine the significance
- produce only marginal decreases (see Fig.  1  for chemical structures of Nec-1 and Nec-1i). The same authors claimed that Nec-1 produced its actions via inhibition of a form of cell death distinct from necrosis and apoptosis which they termed necroptosis  [12] . More recently sitosterol-induced death in macrophages was reported to be caspaseindependent and blocked by Nec-1, and again it was suggested that necroptosis (and autophagy) might be involved  [13] , although considerably more work will be required before necroptosis can be unequivocally confirmed as representing a distinct entity. Protection against I/R injury in the heart and the brain could involve similar mechanisms and this could extend to the particular cell-signaling pathways or enzymes that are activated or down-regulated during the recovery process  [14] . As Nec-1 has been shown to limit cellular damage in the brain we decided to ascertain whether it could produce a similar action in the myocardium. To investigate this we used a variety of in vitro experimental models. Thus, the effects of Nec-1 and Nec-1i were investigated in three cellular systems, namely on C2C12 and H9c2
- MPTP. As delaying MPTP opening is believed to represent a key factor with respect to cardioprotection and may be linked to apoptosis, our failure to show a delay with lower Nec-1 concentrations may be consistent with the findings of Degterev and colleagues  [12] , who claimed that the effects produced by Nec-1 are mediated by a mechanism distinct from necrosis and apoptosis, namely necroptosis. As suggested by Formigli et al.  [20]  for a process they termed aponecrosis and claimed shared characteristics with apoptosis and necrosis, necroptosis could represent one of a continuum of death processes with apoptosis and necrosis occurring at its two extremes  [20] . Clearly, however, before any firm conclusions can be made regarding necroptosis and the mode(s) of action of necrostatins in the context of myocardial infarction more detailed studies, possibly involving the use of Nec-1 in combination with caspase inhibitors (inhibitors which block apoptotic pathways), should be carried out  [21] . An examination of the effects of necrostatins on cell signaling pathways involved in cardioprotection will aid in the characterisation of these agents  [4]

Model Explanation:
The reference article discusses the potential cardioprotective effects of necrostatins, including in the context of myocardial I/R injury. While the reference article does not specifically mention atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or ischemia-reperfusion injury of the brain, it does support the general idea of necrostatins being protective against cell death in the heart.

Eight weeks later they received 32,000 BHA units of virus intraperitoneally and intravenously. Three days later their spleens were removed and the cells fused with SP2/ 0-Ag14 myeloma cells  (Shulman et d, 1978)  as described by  Kohler and Milstein (1975, 1976) . Hybrid cell culture conditions were based on those described by Fazekas de St.  Groth and Scheidegger (1980) .

BHA-antibody complex suspensions were adsorbed to thin carbon films freshly stripped from mica, floated on a 1% w/v solution of sodium silicotungstate (pH 7.0) and then air dried. Micrographs were taken under minimum dose conditions known from analyses of periodic specimens to preserve detail below 1.5 nm; defocus was such that phase contrast was transferred in a continuous band down to about 1.0 nm  (Wrigley et al., 1983) . amination of the other antibody combinations although the position and binding angle of HC3; HC19, and HC45 are less easy to distinguish from one another than from HC31.

DISCUSSION
These results directly demonstrate the sites of binding of four monoclonal antibodies of different specificities to the X-31 BHA. That the sites are different in detail for the different antibodies may be deduced from the observations that the angles formed between Fab regions and the BHA are constant and different for each antibody. The observation that these angles are constant irrespective of the type of complex observed,
- considered in relation to the thxee-dimensional structure of the BHA, Fig.  6 . These considerations indicate that the sites of amino acid substitution are in all four cases appropriately located to be involved directly in the antibody-binding sites. In the case of HC31 they also indicate the basis of the steric inhibition of the binding of a second antibody to the BHA. Since the three 198 residues recognized are only 15 A apart around the threefold axis of the trimer, the BHA is effectively monovalent at this site. The results therefore substantiate the positions of antigenic sites A, B, and E and in the ease of site B give an indication of the extent of this region at the distal tip of the BHA molecule. It would also be of interest to examine antibodies specific for sites C and D but we have not characterized antibodies prepared against X-31 virus which recognize amino acids in these sites.

The reference article provides evidence of different antibody binding sites on the haemagglutinin of influenza virus X-31, but does not specifically mention the addition of glycans affecting antibody binding.

Stamatovic and colleagues further demonstrated that the binding of MCP1 to CCR2 activated PKC (specifically PKCα and PKCζ) and Rho kinase, resulting in shift of tight junction proteins from cell border to intracellular compartments  [65, 66] . Additionally, this phosphorylation event also promoted the interaction between tight junction proteins and actin cytoskeleton, resulting in a shift of tight junction proteins from Triton X-100 soluble fraction to Triton X-100 insoluble fraction  [65-67, 113, 114] . These changes are not limited to MCP1, because growth factors (PDGF and veGF) also induce phosphorylation and redistribution of tight junction proteins  [115, 116] , suggesting that phosphorylation of tight junction proteins may be a common mechanism to transport them to different cellular compartments. In addition to tight junction protein phosphorylation, the activated kinases, especially Rho Kinase, also phosphorylate myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) and inhibit its activity.

Given that microglia are found in the perivascular space, it is speculated that microglia may play an important role in regulating BBB integrity by interacting with other BBB components, including BMeCs, astrocyte endfeet, and pericytes  [230] . There is evidence showing that microglial activation restores BBB integrity after the disruption of BBB  [231] . In contrast, TNF-α released from activated microglia has been shown to impair BBB integrity  [232] , possibly through TNF-α-induced direct cytotoxicity on BMeCs. This discrepancy may be due to different injury models and different timing after injury. Therefore, further investigations are needed to clarify the role of microglia in BBB permeability. As indicated by its name, MCP1 is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and microglia. MCP1-induced chemotaxis of monocytes and microglia has been found in many CNS injuries, including ischemia, excitotoxicity, and hemorrhage  [72, 204, 221, [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] .

These results suggest that eCM proteins and their receptors also contribute to the integrity of BBB.
