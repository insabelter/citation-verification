<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mechanisms by which genetic variation affects transcription regulation and phenotypes at the nucleotide level are incompletely understood. Here, we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineagedetermining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics, and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial genetic evidence supporting the concept that lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications can be used for prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inter-individual genetic variation is a major cause of diversity in phenotypes and disease susceptibility. While sequence variants in gene promoters and protein-coding regions provide obvious prioritization of disease-causing variants, the majority (88%) of GWAS loci are in non-coding DNA, suggesting regulatory functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Prioritization of functional intergenic variants remains challenging due in part to an incomplete understanding of how regulation is achieved at the nucleotide level in different cell types and environmental contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . While recent studies have described important roles for lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs), also referred to as pioneer factors or master regulators, in selecting cell type-specific enhancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> , the sequence determinants that guide their binding are poorly understood. Previous findings in macrophages and B cells suggest a hierarchical model of regulatory function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , where a relatively small set of LDTFs collaboratively compete with nucleosomes to bind DNA in a cell type-specific manner (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a, i-&gt;ii</ref>). The binding of these factors is proposed to 'prime' DNA by initiating deposition of histone modifications that are associated with cis-active regulatory regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, ii -&gt; iii) and enable concurrent or subsequent binding of signal-dependent transcription factors that direct regulated gene expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, iii -&gt;iv) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . In principle, this model provides a straightforward framework that allows non-coding variants to be classified with respect to their ability to directly perturb LDTF binding and their potential to exert indirect effects on binding of other LDTFs and signal-dependent transcription factors. To test the validity of this model and its ability to explain effects of genetic variation on transcription factor binding and function, we exploited the naturally-occurring genetic variation between the inbred C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mouse strains (~4 million SNPs and ~750k InDels <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> ) as an 'in vivo mutagenesis screen.'</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effects of genetic variation</head><p>First, we quantified genome-wide binding patterns of macrophage LDTFs PU.1 and C/EBPα from both mouse strains using ChIP-Seq. These experiments identified a combined 82,154 PU.1 and 54,874 C/EBPα peaks, with less than 1% of sites exhibiting highly significant strain-specific binding (PU.1, n=496; C/EBPα, n=263; 4-fold tag count ratio, FDR &lt; 1e <ref type="bibr">-14</ref> , &gt;90% located &gt;3 kb from gene promoters) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Strainspecific binding was defined using biological ChIP-Seq replicates, which yielded &lt;0.2% empirical false positives (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-g</ref>). Differential binding of PU.1 and C/ EBPα was significantly correlated with differential expression of the nearest gene as measured by RNA-Seq (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). There were no apparent differences in genomic context for strain-similar and strain-specific binding at inter-or intragenic sites (&gt;3 kb to promoters) as defined by CpG content, distance from nearest gene or repetitive element, or conservation score (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). Instead, strain-specific binding was highly correlated with polymorphism frequency. We observed 5-fold enrichment of polymorphisms at strainspecific versus strain-similar PU.1-bound and C/EBPα-bound regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), with the greatest variant density at the peak centers, (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</p><p>To investigate direct effects of sequence variants on transcription factor binding, we identified the most enriched position weight matrices (PWM) in genomic regions marked by histone H3 lysine 4 di-methylation (H3K4me2) or bound by PU.1 or C/EBPα (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This analysis consistently identified consensus and degenerate motifs for the LDTFs PU.1, C/EBP and AP-1 as the most highly enriched PWMs. Notably, the frequency of mutations in these motifs increased with strain-specific binding of PU.1 and C/EBPα (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Excluding strain-specific loci without cis-variation (~11%), 41% of strain-specific PU.1 binding directly associated with strain-specific mutations in PU.1 motifs in the other strain. For C/EBPα, 44% of strainspecific binding associated with strain-specific C/EBPα motifs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</p><p>Although strain-specific binding of PU.1 and C/EBPα was highly linked to strain-specific motif mutations, strain-specific motif mutations were also associated with strain-similar binding (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). This raised the question as to whether specific features of motif mutations could be used to predict strain-specific binding. Comparison of motif mutations in strain-specific to strain-similar peaks revealed three distinct attributes contributing to predictive power. First, mutated motifs within 20 bp of the experimentally defined binding centers were more highly associated with an effect on binding (PU.1, p = 1.6e-4; C/EBPα, p = 0.036; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-d</ref>). Second, the presence of alternate motifs within 100 bp of the PU.1 peak centers significantly buffered the effect of strainspecific PU.1 motifs (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Third, after removing peaks with alternative motifs, analysis of the nucleotides mutated enabled delineation of an empirically defined functional motif that revealed a strong relationship between 'core' mutations and altered binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>-i, p=3.2e-8 PU.1 and p=5.1e-4 C/EBP). Taken together, core motif mutations &lt;20 bp from the peak center that lacked alternative motifs were 3.5× and 3× more likely to occur in differential versus similar bound peaks for PU.1 and C/EBPα, respectively (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>). Notably, up to 90% of these mutations were located in differentially bound peaks (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4l,</ref><ref type="figure">m</ref>). To investigate the possibility that an algorithm incorporating these characteristics could be used to predict the impact of a specific motif mutation on transcription factor binding, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis for PU.1 in macrophages derived from a third inbred strain of mice, NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD). Of the ~1.4 million identifiable PU.1 motifs in the C57BL/6J reference genome, 18,322 contain SNPs that mutate the PU.1 motif in the NOD genome. 1.6% of these mutations were associated with strain specific binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>). Of the 244 NOD PU.1 motif mutations located in PU.1-bound regions in C57BL/6J or BALBc, 68% were associated with strain-specific binding. When considering all three variables (motif distance, alternative motif, and motif core, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), 88% of the predicted functional mutations were consistent with impaired PU.1 binding in NOD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variation and collaborative LDTF binding</head><p>To investigate the potential impact of mutations in LDTF recognition motifs on collaborative binding, we analyzed all strain-specific PU.1 or C/EBPα binding events in regions containing LDTF motif mutations. PU.1 motif mutations resulting in loss of PU.1 binding were frequently associated with a corresponding loss of nearby C/EBPα binding in the absence of C/EBP motif mutations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, top). Conversely, C/EBP motif mutations resulting in loss of C/EBPα binding were frequently associated with a corresponding loss of nearby PU.1 binding in the absence of PU.1 motif mutations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, middle). Similar results were observed at locations containing strain-specific mutations in AP-1 binding motifs, but intact PU.1 and C/EBP motifs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, bottom).</p><p>We next considered the global relationships of mutations in PU.1, C/EBP, and AP-1 motifs with strain-specific binding of PU.1 and C/EBPα, taking into account both consensus and 'weak' motifs for PU.1 and C/EBP. NF-κB motifs were included as controls that were not expected to affect PU.1 or C/EBPα binding in unstimulated macrophages (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>,b, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). While mutations in PU.1 motifs had the strongest effect on strain-specific PU.1 binding, mutations exclusively in C/EBP and/or AP-1 motifs also significantly correlated with differential PU.1 binding relative to similarly bound loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). Similar relationships were observed for C/EBP (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>). The motif distance distributions for co-bound factors were broad (half width ~100 nt), and only a minor subset of sites exhibited defined distances expected for direct protein-protein interactions (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>), suggesting transcription factor-nucleosome competition as the driving force behind the collaborative binding behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Together, strain-specific mutations in nearby C/EBP and AP-1 motifs were associated with ~15% of strain-specific PU.1 binding at sites with strain-similar PU.1 motifs. Mutations in nearby PU.1 and AP-1 motifs were associated with ~30% of strain-specific C/EBPα binding at sites with strain-similar C/EBP motifs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>). Overall, 48% of strain-specific PU.1 binding and 57% of C/EBPα binding was associated with at least one assignable LDTF motif mutation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>). To genetically test whether these correlations are consistent with a collaborative binding model, we considered all LDTF motif mutations and evaluated their effects on PU.1 binding in macrophages derived from NOD mice. For polymorphic strain-specific PU.1 loci containing strain-specific LDTF motifs (n = 220), PU.1 binding profiles matched the strain with shared alleles for 91% and 92% of cases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>). At 8% (n = 17) of the loci, the NOD genome broke the C57BL/6J/BALB/cJ haplotypes, and in all cases, the NOD genotype at the LDTF motif variant matched the strain with similar binding (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), indicating that these variants are likely the cause of binding differences. An example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>, where PU.1 binds in C57BL/6J but not in BALB/cJ or NOD. Only one SNP in this region is associated with PU.1 binding exclusively in C57BL/6J; here, the T allele forms part of a neighboring AP-1 motif in C57BL/6J that is mutated by the C allele in BALB/cJ and NOD. These findings provide genetic evidence that PU.1 binding to this location is dependent on collaborative interactions with AP-1.</p><p>To confirm that the allele-specific binding also occurs in heterozygous cells, we performed ChIP-Seq for PU.1 and C/EBPα in macrophages from CB6F1/J hybrid mice, which are F1 offspring of a C57/BL/6J × BALB/cJ cross. In the great majority of cases, alleles bound specifically in a parental strain were also bound preferentially in the F1 generation. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>).</p><p>Given the genetic evidence that LDTFs collaborate to bind DNA, we next tested the extent to which strain-specific LDTF binding explained promoter-distal (&gt;3 kb) strain-specific histone modification events, such as H3K4me2 and H3K27Ac deposition, which respectively mark 'primed' and 'active' chromatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, ii-&gt;iii). Genomic regions exhibiting strain-specific binding of PU.1 and C/EBPα were associated with strain-specific H3K4me2 and H3K27ac (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, right columns). Strain-specific histone modifications correlated with nearby gene expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), and H3K27Ac modification tracked with the corresponding parental allele in CB6F1/J hybrid mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>). Strain-specific binding of PU.1 and C/EBPα were individually correlated with H3Kme2 and H3K27Ac deposition, with the combined binding of both factors exhibiting even greater correlation than the individual factors (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-f</ref>). Further, LDTF motif mutations segregated with differential LDTF binding and histone modifications (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>). Together, these findings support the concept that LDTFs play quantitatively important roles in establishing these histone modifications, likely through initiating transcription in a combinatorial fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are polymorphic loci whose alleles are associated with individual RNA expression levels across a population <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Thus, eQTLs define active gene regulatory loci and provide an alternative method for assigning regulatory function to gene expression. To interrogate the relationship between histone modification and eQTLs, we analyzed previously reported eQTL data from 85 inbred mouse strains in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) in primary macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (see Methods). We found that eQTLs overlapped H3K4me2-or H3K27Ac-marked regions at frequencies greater than expected by chance, supporting the role of histone modifications as landmarks of regulatory activity (hypergeometric test p-values: H3K4me2 = 1e -2147 , H3K27Ac = 1e -2290 ). Next, given the highly cell type-specific nature of gene regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , we hypothesized that eQTLs from different cell types would be reflected in the histone modification profiles in the same cell type. We examined liver and macrophage eQTLs for a set of ~130k SNPs from the HMDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> for overlap with H3K27Ac loci defined in macrophages or in liver, pro-B, or mouse ES cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Macrophage eQTL were more significantly enriched for overlap with macrophage H3K27Ac regions than liver H3K27Ac. Similarly, liver eQTL were most significantly enriched with liver H3K27Ac relative to macrophage H3K27Ac (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>). Clustering of H3K27Ac profiles revealed that liver and ES H3K27Ac profiles are most similar (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7h</ref>), providing an explanation as to why liver eQTLs were highly enriched in mES H3K27Ac regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LDTF motif mutations affect NF-κB binding</head><p>To evaluate the prediction that primed regulatory loci (containing H3K4me2) often require additional binding of signal-dependent TFs to achieve regulatory activity (Fig 1a, iii-&gt;v), we treated C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ macrophages with Kdo2-Lipid A (KLA), a potent and specific agonist of TLR4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .

We performed ChIP-Seq for PU.1, C/EBPα and the RelA/p65 component of NF-κB in untreated and KLA-treated macrophages and observed that 61% of sites that gained p65 were pre-bound by PU.1 and/or C/EBPα without KLA. De novo motif analysis indicated that an AP-1 motif was present in 42% of the remaining sites, suggesting that AP-1 is responsible for priming a large proportion of the p65 cistrome (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>), in line with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</p><p>To further interrogate the dependence of p65 on LDTFs we focused on sites that gained p65 only in one strain (n = 932, &gt;90% promoter-distal, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> th column). In the vast majority of cases, PU.1 and/or C/EBPα were bound prior to KLA treatment only in the strain exhibiting p65 binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). In addition, strain-specific p65 binding primarily occurred at loci already marked by H3K4me2, and led to an increase of H3K27Ac, consistent with the proposed model. To analyze the effects of genetic variation on transcription factor motifs, we performed strain-specific LDTF and NF-κB motif finding in polymorphic strain-specific p65-bound peaks (n = 750) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>). Notably, p65 binding was influenced by mutations in individual LDTF motifs to a similar extent as mutations in the NF-κB motif itself (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>). For strainspecific p65 binding events, 34% could be attributed to assignable mutations in PU.1, C/ EBP, or AP-1 motifs, whereas 9% could be explained by mutations in the assignable NF-κB motifs themselves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>). RelA/p65 is known to bind to degenerate and non-canonical motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> that might not be captured by de novo motif analysis. To gain motif-independent insight into variant location and strain-specific TF binding, we assessed the variant frequency relative to the centers of strain-specific p65 peaks. Similar to strain-specific PU.1 and C/EBPα peaks, strain-specific p65 peaks are in regions of higher variant density than strain-similar peaks (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>). In contrast to LDTFs, where strainspecifically bound regions have a high variant density at their peak centers, the distribution of variants at strain-specific p65 peaks is significantly different from those of the LDTFs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value &lt; 0.013) as it contains fewer variants at the peak centers and is broader (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8d-f</ref>). This is consistent with p65 binding being more affected by sequence variation in motifs of neighboring factors than LDTFs.</p><p>Overall, strain-specific p65-bound regulatory sites were significantly correlated with nearby genic transcription and mRNA production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>). We tested strain-specifically bound and epigenetically marked putative enhancer sequences with strain-specific mutations for differential enhancer function in transient and stable reporter assays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, Extended Data Figs. <ref type="figure">9a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). We observed the predicted strain-specific enhancer activity for 18 of 20 of these genomic sequences. Conversely, enhancer elements with sequence variation in noncore nucleotides that were not predicted to alter PU.1 or C/EBP binding and that exhibited strain-similar binding patterns exhibited similar enhancer activity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a</ref>).</p><p>Lastly, we tested whether the predicted motif-disrupting variants could specifically explain strain-specific enhancer activity by swapping variants at the putative causative alleles in C57BL/6J to BALB/cJ while maintaining the genetic background for the remainder of the enhancer sequences. Representative examples in which reversal of such SNPs in PU.1, C/EBP and p65 motifs reversed strain-specific enhancer activity are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref> and Extended Data Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>. In contrast, reversal of nearby SNPs not predicted to alter LDTF motifs had no effect on strain-specific enhancer activity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In concert, we have exploited natural genetic variation to test a collaborative model for enhancer selection and function, and conversely explored the ability of this model to explain strain-specific differences in transcription factor binding and epigenetic features associated with functional enhancers in macrophages. These studies provide genetic evidence that lineage-determining transcription factors are dependent on collaborative binding to variably spaced DNA recognition motifs in order to select enhancers and enable binding of signaldependent transcription factors. Notably, the variable motif distances observed at co-bound LDTF loci suggests that collaborative binding does not generally require direct proteinprotein interactions between the involved transcription factors. The proposed hierarchical LDTF collaborative model provides a conceptual framework for prioritization of non-coding disease-associated regulatory variants. While all cells express hundreds of transcription factors, a large fraction of functional enhancers (~70% in macrophages) are characterized by collaborative interactions involving relatively small sets of lineage determining transcription factors (e.g., PU.1, AP-1 and C/EBPs). The requirement for collaborative binding interactions provides an explanation for why transcription factor binding is lost at sites where mutations do not occur in the cognate recognition motif. In the case of NF-κB, for example, mutations in the motifs for lineage determining factors were approximately three times more likely to result in decreased binding of NF-κB than mutations in the NF-κB binding site itself. An essential step in leveraging the collaborative model to pinpoint potential disease-causing variants is the definition of relevant LDTF binding sites and functionally important variants. At the current level of genome annotation, this cannot be achieved by analysis of DNA sequence alone. For example, there are ~1-2×10 6 identifiable PU.1 binding sites in the human <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and mouse genomes, but &lt;10% are actually occupied by PU.1 in macrophages. By experimentally defining strain-similar and strain-specific binding patterns for PU.1, the relevant sites at which mutations can result in altered function are identified. Comparison of PU.1 motif mutations associated with strain-specific versus strainsimilar binding allowed the genetic definition of a functional binding matrix and additional distinguishing features that enabled accurate prediction of functional mutations in a third strain. Thus, by collecting a relatively limited set of genomic binding data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications, this analytical approach can be exploited to explain a greater extent of variation in enhancer selection and function than previously possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . To further increase the specificity and sensitivity for detecting functional variations, identification of transcription factor motifs that permit binding but diverge from the consensus PWM, i.e. "weak" motifs, needs to be improved, as such sites are more likely to be affected by mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . In addition, transcription factors less abundant than LDTFs likely play individually small but collectively significant roles. At a larger scale, non-cisacting, long-range epigenetic mechanisms may also be important for enhancer selection. A major goal for the future will be to extend these approaches to understanding natural genetic variation associated with human disease.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals and Cell Culture</head><p>Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected 4 days post-injection from male 6-8 wk C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ or CB6F1/J Hybrid mice and plated at 20 × 10 6 cells/15cm petri dish in RPMI1640 + 10% FBS + 1X PenStrep. One day after plating, cells were treated with fresh media with or without 100 ng/ml Kdo2-LipidA (KLA) for 1 hour and then directly used for downstream analyses. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the ethical standards set forth by UC San Diego's Institutional Annual Care and Use Committee (IUCAC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ChIP-Seq and Feature Identification</head><p>Media was decanted and cells were fixed at room temperature with either 1% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 minutes (for PU.1, C/EBPa, H3K27Ac ChIPs) or 2 mM disuccinimidylglutarate (DSG, Pierce)/10% DMSO/PBS for 30 minutes followed by 1% formaldehyde/PBS for another 15 minutes (p65). After quenching the reaction by adding glycine to 0.125 M, cells were washed twice with PBS and snap-frozen in dry-ice/methanol. ChIPs for PU.1 (Santa Cruz, sc-352), C/EBPa (Santa Cruz, sc-61) were performed exactly as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . The H3K27Ac (Abcam, ab4729) ChIP was performed in the presence of 1 mM butyric acid. For p65 (Santa Cruz, sc-372), IP conditions were identical to the ones described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , except that pre-clearing was omitted, and the ChIP was performed with 5 μg antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-372) pre-bound to 50 μl Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes in 0.5% BSA/TE, and a final wash with TE/50 mM NaCl was performed before elution. ChIP-Seq library preps for the initial p65 ChIPs were performed as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , libraries for the replicates were prepared using magnetic beads similar to previously described procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . ChIPs for H3K4me2 were carried out on MNase-digested chromatin as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . To control for open chromatin and library biases, input chromatin libraries after sonication were sequenced for each strain, crosslinking condition and ChIP lysis protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> using barcoded adapters (NextFlex, Bioo Scientific), and sequenced for 50 cycles on a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina) using CASAVA1.7 or 1.8. C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ demultiplexed fastq files were mapped to both the mm9 reference (C57BL/6J) genome and the BALB/cJ contigs 17 using Bowtie0.12.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> with the options -m 1 --best -n 3 -e 200. Mapping parameters for C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ data allowed 3 mismatches in the 28 bp seed sequence with up to 5 high quality mismatches in the entire 50 bp read. NOD ChIP-Seq data were mapped to the mm9 genome using the above options. To identify allele-specific reads from CB6F1/J data, ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the C57BL/6J or BALB/cJ sequence using Bowtie2-2.0.0-beta7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> allowing 0 mismatches in 32 bp reads with options -N 0 -L 32 --score-min L,0,0 --gbar 17. Tags mapping to both genomes were discarded. Resulting allele-specific reads were counted for regions of interest.</p><p>For C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ data, reads mapping to only one genome were discarded (&lt;2% of total) to avoid bias caused by mappability differences, and reads mapping to both were assigned to the mm9 genomic location. Genomic binding peaks for transcription factors PU. 1, C/EBPa, and p65, were identified using the findPeaks command in the HOMER (<ref type="url" target="http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/">http:// biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/</ref>) software suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> with default settings of -style factor: 200 bp peaks with 4-fold tag enrichment and 0.001 FDR significance over background (ChIP input), 4fold enrichment over local tags, and normalization to 10 million mapped tags per experiment. H3K4me2 and H3K27Ac regions used for initial de novo motif finding (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>) were identified using the default parameters of findPeaks -style histone with the addition of -nfr centering for H3K4me2 MNase data. For H3K4me2 and H3K27Ac peaks identified for comparison to LDTF binding and mutation events (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>), findPeaks -style peaks was used to define more focal, non-gene associated loci. In particular, H3K27Ac regions were identified with the findPeaks options -style factor usingsize 1000bp -L2 (2-fold enrichment over local tags). H3K27Ac peaks were merged between strains using mergePeaks -size given and peaks were resized to 1 kb. Peaks within 3 kb of gene promoters were excluded from further analysis. H3K4me2 peaks were identified using findPeaks options -style factor -size 500 -L2 -C0 (which allows for unlimited tags considered per genome position as may occur with MNase data). Peaks were then centered on the best nucleosome-free region (nfr) within a 1 kb window using getPeakTags -nfr. Peak files between strains were merged with mergePeaks -size given and H3K4me2 tags were counted in 1 kb regions centered on the merged peak file definitions. Peaks were then re-centered based on the best nfr in 1 kb identified by getPeakTags -nfr according to the strain with more H3K4me2 tags. Peaks were extended to 1 kb and restricted to those &gt;3 kb from gene promoters.</p></div>

These PWM were used to define strain-specific motifs by using the options homer2 -find &lt;individual genome sequence&gt; in HOMER for each genome sequence for the regions of interest. The positions of the identified motifs were compared between strains taking into account shifts cause by InDels relative to peak start coordinates and which DNA strand matched the identified motifs.

Horizontal bars indicate average luciferase (enhancer) activity of the empty vector (blue, no enhancer), activity of a locus cloned from either strain in grey C57BL/6J (above) and BALB/cJ (below) under basal conditions, or after overnight stimulation with 100 ng/ml KLA (pink). Luciferase values from transiently transfected cells were normalized to the activity measured for a co-transfected UB6 promoter-β-Gal reporter construct. Empty vector values were scaled to 0.5 for the first four loci and to 1 for the remaining loci. Error bars show standard deviations calculated from 3 biological replicates, average values are indicated next to each bar. Experiments were replicated at least 3 times. Significant strain-specific enhancer activity is indicated by § (grey without treatment, red after KLA treatment, one-tailed t-test, p-value &lt; 0.05). b, Chromatinization is necessary for the strain specificity of a subset of enhancers.

Three independent transient transfection experiments were performed in RAW264.7 cells, with triplicate transfections of each construct. Where indicated, variant nucleotides in a motif were mutated to that present in the other strain, and the resulting enhancer activity was scored relative to the wild-type allele.
