Herein we report the synthesis of well-defined ellipsoidal colloidal particles with anisotropy in both morphology and magnetic properties and then demonstrate their assembly into three-dimensional ordered structures with unique tunable photonic properties.U nlike conventional colloidal crystals made from spherical magnetic particles where dynamic tuning of photonic property can only be achieved by controlling the field strength, <ref type="bibr">[4a,5]</ref> the diffraction properties of the current systems are strongly dependent on the field direction, which affects the orientation of the ellipsoidal particles.A wide range of tuning in the diffraction spectrum can therefore be achieved by controlling the direction of the external magnetic field, while the field strength has only minimal influence on the diffraction wavelength.</p><p>As uniform magnetic ellipsoidal particles are not directly available,w et ook an indirect approach by first synthesizing uniform iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanorods, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> then coating them with silica to form composite ellipsoids,a nd finally converting the FeOOH into magnetic metallic iron through reduction. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref> show TEM images of two typical samples of FeOOH nanorods with average dimensions of 70 nm 10nm( length diameter,F eOOH-A) and 110 nm 20 nm (FeOOH-B). Thes urface of as-prepared FeOOH nanorods were functionalized by polyacrylic acid, and coated with at hick layer of silica. During the coating process,t he aspect ratio of nanorods decreased and eventually led to the formation of ellipsoids.T oc onvert the FeOOH core into magnetic species,t he FeOOH@SiO 2 ellipsoids were reduced in H 2 at 500 8 8C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[7]</ref>  and acoercivity of 500 Gfor NE-A, and asaturated magnetization of 1.2 emu g À1 and acoercivity of 800 Gfor NE-B.The magnetizations of NE-A and NE-B are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the superparamagnetic colloidal nanocrystal clusters that were used to construct one-dimensional photonic chains in our previous work. <ref type="bibr">[4a]</ref> As the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions between nanoellipsoids are negligible,t hey do not show any apparent sign of aggregation/assembly when exposed to external magnetic fields,asdemonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>.</p><p>Thes ilica coating plays multiple important roles in this system. First, it increases the dimensions of the FeOOH nanorods to the size range suitable for creating photonic responses in the visible spectrum. Second, it provides ap rotection mechanism that prevents the disintegration of the nanorods during the conversion from FeOOH into Fe which involves dehydration and reduction reactions and consequently significant morphological changes.F inally,t he silica layer acts as as pacer that separates the magnetic nanorods by certain distance and limits their mutual magnetic attraction, therefore preventing their colloidal dispersion from aggregation despite the ferromagnetic nature of the nanorods.</p><p>An additional benefit of having the silica layer is the ease of establishing electrostatic interactions among the ellipsoids, which is the key for the successful assembly of colloids photonic crystals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[8]</ref> Thea s-reduced nanoellipsoidal particles, although dispersible in water, do not process sufficient charge on their surfaces to establish electrostatic interactions,a s confirmed by z-potential measurements.H owever,t his issue can be conveniently addressed by heating the ellipsoids in water under reflux, during which more silanol groups are created on the particle surface by etching of the silica layer by water. Ac oncentrated solution of such highly charged particles can self-assemble into ordered structures even without the presence of external fields,a sd riven by minimization of electrostatic repulsive interactions. <ref type="bibr">[1d, 5b,8,9]</ref> An external magnetic field, however, can help to align the ellipsoids,d ecrease ordering defects,a nd improve the reflectance of the colloidal assemblies.</p><p>By using NE-A as an example,wedemonstrate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) the effect of reflux in water on the surface charge of the ellipsoids and the diffraction intensity of the resultant photonic crystals.Amagnetic field of approximately 50 mT was applied perpendicular to the direction of incident light to improve ordering during the measurement. The z-potential of as-reduced nanoparticles was found to be À31 mV,which was insufficient to ensure long-range order in ac oncentrated solution, as confirmed by the poor photonic performance measured in the reflectance mode.R efluxing the nanoellipsoids in water significantly enhanced the surface charges as well as their photonic performance.A fter 2h under reflux, the z-potential dropped to À57 mV,c omparable to the polyacrylate-capped Fe 3 O 4 particles (À49 mV) and the refluxed Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 particles (À56.5 mV) that we reported before, <ref type="bibr">[4b,5b]</ref> andt hus dramatically enhanced the reflectance intensity (ca. 67.5 %). Since extending the refluxing time to 150 min led to almost the same results,weused samples that had been under reflux for 2hfor all the following measurements and discussions.</p><p>Compared with spheres,aunique feature of the anisotropic nanoellipsoids is that their photonic assemblies show as trong dependence to field direction. In addition to the positional order that is usually considered for describing assemblies from spherical building blocks,orientational order should also be taken into account when nanoellipsoids are assembled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[10]</ref> Upon the application of magnetic fields,n anoellipsoids rotate and align their long axis parallel to the field direction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). Such rotation not only gives rise to changes in orientational orders,b ut also affects positional orders and subsequently photonic properties of the assemblies.I na ddition, the field strength also plays an important  To investigate the effect of field strength and direction, we examined the photonic properties of structures assembled from samples of NE-A and NE-B,under magnetic fields with varying strengths and directions.A queous dispersions of nanoellipsoids were concentrated to av olume fraction of 18 %t oa llow their spontaneous ordering into colloidal crystals.F igure 3b,c show the reflection spectra of photonic structures assembled from these two samples under magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the incident light. A magnetic field perpendicular to the light aligns nanoellipsoids in the perpendicular orientation so that the interplanar spacing is mainly determined by the short axis of nanoellipsoids,resulting in areflection peak at shorter wavelength. When the field direction is switched to be parallel to the light, the interplanar spacing is determined by the long axis of nanoellipsoids,a ccounting for ar eflection peak at longer wavelength. Thefield strength, on the other hand, is found to influence the intensity of reflectance rather than the wavelength, for both samples.T he increased reflectance intensity under stronger fields is believed to result from the better orientational order of the nanoellipsoids: because of the limited amount of magnetic species embedded inside them, the rotation of nanoellipsoids requires as ufficiently high magnetic field to allow the magnetic torque to overcome the rotational resistance. When the field direction is fixed, varying the field strength does not alter the reflection wavelength. Thecontribution of the magnetic interactions between nanoellipsoids to the interplanar spacing of the assemblies seems to be negligible,m ainly owing to the effective separation of the magnetic nanorods by the relatively thick silica coating.</p><p>Different from conventional colloidal crystals assembled using spheres where tuning of photonic property can only be achieved by controlling the interplanar spacing through variation in field strength, <ref type="bibr">[4a, 5, 11]</ref> tuning field direction results in simultaneous rotation of nanoellipsoids,which further leads to changes in the orientation of the crystal assemblies as well as their photonic properties. <ref type="bibr">[4b]</ref> We investigated the photonic property of structures assembled from NE-A and NE-B,u nder ar otating magnetic field of approximately 50 mT.A ss hown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>,e,t he wavelength of reflectance peak reaches aminimum value when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident light, and gradually red shifts as the field switches from perpendicular to parallel to the incident light. Such shift in reflection wavelengths responds to the change of field direction immediately (&lt; 1s)a nd is fully reversible.Anotable feature of such magnetic tuning is that the maximum intensity is achieved at the two end points when the magnetic fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light. When the field direction is switched away from these two end points, the relative intensity decreases and reaches aminimum at the middle point (ca. 458 8 from the parallel and perpendicular directions), resulting in an overall U-shaped profile of reflectance peaks.T his is am ajor difference when compared to one-dimensional photonic chains where the strongest reflectance is only achievable under intermediate field intensity and the profile of reflectance peaks is an inverted Uc urve. <ref type="bibr">[4a]</ref> As expected, nanoellipsoids with higher aspect ratio,a si nt he case of NE-B than that of NE-A, lead to more changes in the interplanar spacing when the orientation of the assembled crystals are switched, resulting in abroader tuning range in photonic response.</p><p>Theo rientational dependence of the nanoellipsoidal assemblies can find direct use in creating photonic patterns under magnetic fields with non-uniform field directions.A s demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>,w hen subjected to complex magnetic field produced by an on-ideal linear Halbach array which has aspatially rotating pattern of magnetization, adispersion of NE-B encapsulated in aflat glass tube exhibits ar ainbow pattern containing blue,g reen, and red stripes. Unlike our previously demonstrated one-dimensional photonic assembly which only shows single color stripes at areas with field parallel to the incident angle, <ref type="bibr">[5a]</ref> the current system displays red and blue stripes at areas with parallel and horizontal fields,and atransitional green stripe in between at off-angle areas.</p><p>In addition to orientation, the interplanar spacing of the photonic assemblies is also determined by the volume fractions of the nanoellipsoids. <ref type="bibr">[4b]</ref> As the volume fraction decreases,t he distance between nanoellipsoids increases, resulting in the expansion of crystal lattice as well as redshift of reflection wavelength. In the absence of magnetic fields,the reflection spectra of photonic assemblies formed by NE-A under different volume fractions were recorded (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). Ther eflection peak shifted from 425 nm to 660 nm, as the volume fractions decreased from 32 %t o1 0%. Consistently,arainbow-like color effect was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>)i nt he dispersion of NE-A with av olume fraction gradient, which was achieved by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5min.</p><p>Thes ynergy between field direction and volume fraction allows for awide range of tuning of the optical property of the assemblies.Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref> plots the changes in peak positions with volume fraction of the solution for sample NE-A under parallel or perpendicular magnetic fields or no field. Interestingly,f or each volume fraction, the difference in the peak position of the photonic assemblies under parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields remains constantly at around 105 nm, as represented by the black dashed line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>. Such ad ifference in peak positions is attributed to the difference in the long axis and the short axis of nanoellipsoids, and therefore is not subjected to change with volume fraction. Without magnetic fields,t he orientation of nanoellipsoids is less uniform so that the interplanar spacings of the assemblies and the positions of reflection peaks are always between those under parallel and perpendicular fields.I nt he absence of external fields,t he nanoellipsoids tend to align themselves along the surface of sample container,which is perpendicular to the incident angle so that the reflection peak is close to that of the case with ap erpendicular field (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>). The orientational order of nanoellipsoids enhances as the volume fraction increases and eventually becomes nearly the same as the case aligned by magnetic fields,asconfirmed by the coincidence of the peak positions at ah igh volume fraction of approximately 32 %. Thee nhanced orientational order can be explained by the reduced excluded volume of each nanoellipsoid at ahigher volume fraction. <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> Theoretical investigations have predicted that anisotropic nanoparticles would preferentially form as tretched facecentered cubic (fcc)s tructure as the volume fraction reaches ac ritical threshold. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>,w hen the original fcc lattice is stretched along h100i, h110i,o rh 111i axes,ittransforms into body-centered tetragonal (bct), bodycentered orthorhombic (bco), or face-centered orthorhombic (fco)l attices,r espectively.T he periodicities of photonic assemblies along different axes were calculated using diffraction wavelengths through Braggs law; they were then plugged in the above three lattices to find out the lattice constants.As  shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>,the fco lattice has the closest value to the experimental volume fractions compared to the bct and bco lattices.Inthe fco lattice,the distances between one particular ellipsoid and its twelve nearest neighbors are almost identical; while in the bct or bco lattices,the interparticle distances vary more than 30 nm or 60 nm, respectively,a sp lotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>.A st he assembly of nanoellipsoids is driven solely by electrostatic forces,t he interparticle surface-to-surface distances are not expected to vary significantly.Therefore in our system, nanoellipsoids were most likely assembled into an fco lattice,i na ccordance to theoretical predictions that the fco lattice is most energetically favorable among the above three structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[14]</ref> In summary,w eh ave demonstrated an ew class of magnetically responsive photonic crystals whose diffraction properties can be widely tuned instantaneously and fully reversibly by controlling the field direction. Assembled from uniform shape-and magnetically anisotropic nanoellipsoidal particles,t he novel colloidal crystals diffract at am inimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle and am aximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel. Thed iffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the field is either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is off-angle,displaying aunique U-shaped profile in reflectance peaks.The current system not only allows more opportunities in studying the assembly behavior of shape-and magnetically anisotropic nanostructures but also provides an ew platform for building novel active optical components for various color presentation and display applications.</p><p>Keywords: anisotropic nanomaterials •magnetic properties • photonic structures •s elf-assembly</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1c,d show the TEM images of asreduced samples,c learly indicating au niform ellipsoidal morphology.The nanoellipsoids synthesized from FeOOH-A (NE-A) have an average dimension of 190 nm 130 nm and those from FeOOH-B (NE-B) of 220 nm 130 nm.
