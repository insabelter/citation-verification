<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>In the stock market, technical analysis is a useful method for predicting stock prices. Although, professional stock analysts and fund managers usually make subjective judgments, based on objective technical indicators, it is difficult for non-professionals to apply this forecasting technique because there are too many complex technical indicators to be considered. Moreover, two drawbacks have been found in many of the past forecasting models: (1) statistical assumptions about variables are required for time series models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), to produce forecasting models of mathematical equations, and these are not easily understood by stock investors; and (2) the rules mined from some artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as neural networks (NN), are not easily realized.</p><p>In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model, using multi-technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Further, it includes four proposed procedures in the hybrid model to provide efficient rules for forecasting, which are evolved from the extracted rules with high support value, by using the toolset based on rough sets theory (RST): (1) select the essential technical indicators, which are highly related to the future stock price, from the popular indicators based on a correlation matrix; (2) use the cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA) and minimize the entropy principle approach (MEPA) to partition technical indicator value and daily price fluctuation into linguistic values, based on the characteristics of the data distribution; (3) employ a RST algorithm to extract linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset; and (4) utilize genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to get better forecasting accuracy and stock return. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with two types of performance evaluations, accuracy and stock return, and by using a six-year period of the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) as the experiment dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, RST and GAs).</p><p>Ó 2010 Elsevier Inc.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the stock market, it is very difficult to forecast stock trends because of complex factors influencing stock markets and nonlinear relationships, which are contained among different periods of stock prices. Although only a few investors profit from the stock market, millions of them still have not given up trying to make money from the market. Therefore, since the first stock market opened, numerous forecasting methods have been employed in an attempt to predict stock prices.</p><p>In the area of stock market forecasting, the technical analysis method is one of the primary analytic approaches used by investors to make investment decisions, and many researchers have been focusing on technical analysis to increase their investment returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Furthermore, the technical analysis method has the ability to forecast the future price direction by studying past market data, primarily stock price and volume. The technical analysis method assumes that stock price and volume are the two most relevant factors in determining the future direction and behavior of a particular stock or market, and that the technical indicators, coming from a mathematical formula, based on stock price and volume, can be applied to predict price fluctuations and also provide data for investors, enabling them to determine the timing for the buying or selling of stock <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Besides the technical analysis methods, many conventional numeric forecasting models have been proposed by financial researchers, such as Engle's <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, Bollerslev's <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> generalized ARCH (GARCH) model, Box and Jenkins' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA).</p><p>In recent decades, many researchers have employed another approach to financial forecasting: artificial intelligence algorithms In 1990, Kinoto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> developed a prediction system for the stock market by using a neural network. Nikolopoulos and Fellrath <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> combined genetic algorithms (GAs) and a neural network to develop a hybrid expert system for investment decisions. Kim and Han <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a genetic algorithms approach in order to feature discretization and the determination of connection weights for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the stock price index. Huarng and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> applied a backpropagation neural network to establish fuzzy relationships in fuzzy time series for forecasting stock prices. Roh <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> integrated a neural network and time series model for forecasting the volatility of the stock price index.</p><p>From the literature noted above, however, three major drawbacks can be found in their forecasting methods and models: (1) stock market analysts and fund managers apply various technical indicators to forecast stock market trends, based on their personal experience, which could result in erroneous judgments of market signals; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> for most statistical methods, there are some assumptions about the variables used in the analysis, which can not be applied to those datasets that do not follow the statistical distributions; and (3) the artificial neural network (ANN) is a black-box method, and the rules mined from it are not easily understandable.</p><p>To improve upon past forecasting models, a revised model should be able to overcome the drawbacks contained in previous models and should offer a good methodology which could be used more easily by investors. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model to refine past models in stock price forecasting, and provides four novel methods in the forecasting processes: (1) select essential technical indicators by using a correlation matrix; (2) use CPDA (cumulative probability distribution approach) and MEPA (minimize entropy principle approach) to discretize condition features (technical indicators) and decision features (daily price fluctuation); (3) apply the rough set theory (RST) to produce rules from the linguistic values of technical indicators; and (4) employ genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to improve forecasting accuracy and stock return.</p><p>Empirically, this paper employs two types of stock databases (stock index and individual stock price) as experimental datasets. From the model verification, it is shown that the refined processes are effective in improving forecasting accuracy, and, based on the evidence, a stock analyst or investor can employ the refined processes proposed in this paper to improve their forecasting tools or models.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized, as follows: Section 2 introduces the related works; Section 3 demonstrates the proposed model and algorithm; Section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed model and describes the findings; and Section 5 draws conclusions and proposes recommendations for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Technical analysis</head><p>Technical analysis is an attempt to predict future stock price movements by analyzing a past sequence of stock prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. It relies on charts and looks for particular configurations that are supposed to have predictive value. Analysts focus on investor psychology, which represents common investors' responses to certain price formations and price movements, to analyze the fluctuations of stock market. The price at which investors are willing to buy or sell depends on personal expectation. If investors expect the security price to rise, they will buy it; if investors expect the security price to fall, they will sell it. These simple statements are the cause for a major challenge in setting security prices, because they refer to human expec-tations and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. It is said that, securities never sell for what they are worth, but for what people think they are worth. It is very important to understand that market participants anticipate future development and take timely action, which compels the price movement. Since stock market processes are highly nonlinear, many researchers have been focusing on technical analysis to improve investment returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA)</head><p>Probability refers to the study of randomness and uncertainty. In any situation, one of a number of possible outcomes may occur. The theory of probability provides methods for quantifying the chances, or likelihoods, associated with the various outcomes. Because a probability distribution on the real line is determined by the probability of being in a half-open interval p(a, b], therefore, F(b) À F(a) if a &lt; b. The probability distribution of a real-valued random variable X is completely characterized by its cumulative distribution function (CDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For every real number x, the CDF of X is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x ! F X ðxÞ ¼ PðX 6 xÞ 8x 2 R<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where the right-hand side represents the probability (p) that the random variable X takes on a value less than, or equal to, x. Capital F is used to represent the cumulative distribution function, in contrast to the lower-case f , used to represent probability density functions and probability mass functions. The CDF of X can be defined in terms of the probability density function f , as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">FðxÞ ¼ P½X 6 x ¼ Z x 1 f ðtÞdt<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>The inverse of the normal CDF is computed with parameters l and r at the corresponding probabilities in P, where l denotes the mean and r denotes the standard deviation of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The normal inverse function in terms of the normal CDF is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x ¼ F À1 ðpjl; rÞ ¼ fx : Fðxjl; rÞ ¼ pg;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">where p ¼ Fðxjl; rÞ ¼ 1 r ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 2p p Z x À1 e Àðt À lÞ 2 2r 2 dt<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>The cumulative probability of normal distribution is used to determine the intervals. The steps of the cumulative probability distribution approach are as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>:</p><p>Step 1: Test normal distribution.</p><p>In this approach, the data must be of normal distribution. This study utilizes CPDA because stock market fluctuations and returns tend to be of normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</p><p>Step 2: Define the universe of discourse U. Let U ¼ ½D Àr min ; D þr max , where D min and D max denote the minimum and maximum values in historical data, and r denotes the standard deviation of the yearly data.</p><p>Step 3: Determine the length of intervals and build a membership function. P LB , as the lower boundary of cumulative probability, and P UB , as the upper boundary of cumulative probability of each linguistic value, are computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P LB ¼ ð2i À 3Þ=2n ð25i5nÞ<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">P UB ¼ i=n ð15i5nÞ<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where i denotes the order of the linguistic values, and n denotes the number of linguistic values. The lower boundary of the first linguistic value and the upper boundary of the last linguistic value correspond to the lower and upper boundary, respectively. This step computes the inverse of the normal CDF by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) and (4).</p><p>Step 4: Fuzzify the historical data.</p><p>According to the inverse of normal CDF, the lower boundary, midpoint and upper boundary as the triangular fuzzy number of each linguistic value, can be computed. The triangular fuzzy number is applied to build a membership function. The membership degree of each instance is calculated to determine its linguistic value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Minimize entropy principle approach (MEPA)</head><p>The purpose of entropy minimization analysis is to determine the information content in a given dataset. The entropy of a probability distribution is a measure of the uncertainty of the distribution [51]. To divide the data into membership functions, establishing the point of segmentation between classes of data is needed. A point of segmentation can be determined with an entropy minimization screening method; then, start the segmentation process by first dividing it into two classes. Thereupon, a repeated partitioning with the value of segment point calculations will allow us to partition the dataset into a number of fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In recent years, MEPA has been used in forecasting problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Assume that the value of the segment point is being sought for a sample in the range between x 1 and x 2 . An entropy equation is written for the regions ½x 1 ; x and ½x; x 2 , and denotes the first region p and the second region q. Entropy with each value of x is expressed as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> SðxÞ ¼ pðxÞS p ðxÞ þ qðxÞS q ðxÞ ð7Þ where S p ðxÞ ¼ À½p 1 ðxÞ ln p 1 ðxÞ þ p 2 ðxÞ ln p 2 ðxÞ S q ðxÞ ¼ À½q 1 ðxÞ ln q 1 ðxÞ þ q 2 ðxÞ ln q 2 ðxÞ ð8Þ</p><p>and where p k ðxÞ and q k ðxÞ are the conditional probabilities that the class k sample is in region ½x 1 ; x 1 þ x and ½x 1 þ x; x 2 , respectively, and pðxÞ and q(x) are the probabilities that all samples are in region ½x 1 ;</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x 1 þ x and ½x 1 þ x; x 2 , respectively. pðxÞ þ qðxÞ ¼ 1<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>The value of x that gives the minimum entropy is the optimum value of the segment point.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Rough set theory</head><p>Rough sets theory (RST) was proposed by Pawlak <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> in 1982. In recent years, RST has been used in economic and financial prediction. Many researchers have applied RST to discover trading rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. The concept of RST is founded on the assumption that with every associated object of the universe of discourse, some information objects characterized by the same information are indiscernible in the view of the available information about them. Any set of all indiscernible objects is called an elementary set and forms a basic granule of knowledge about the universe. Any union of elementary sets is referred to as a precise set; otherwise the set is rough.</p><p>With any rough sets, a pair of precise sets, called the lower and upper approximation, BX ¼ fxj½x B # Xg and BX ¼ fxj½x B \ X -;g of the rough sets, is associated <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The lower approximation consists of all objects that definitely belong to the set, and the upper approximation contains all objects that possibly belong to the set. The difference between the upper and the lower approximation constitutes the boundary region, BN B ðxÞ ¼ BX À BX, of the rough sets. The set X is called ''rough" (or ''roughly definable") with respect to the knowledge in B, if the boundary region is non-empty. The basic notions in rough sets are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The RST is a series of logical reasoning procedures used for analyzing an information system. An information system can be seen as a decision table, denoted by S ¼ ðU; A; C; DÞ, where U is the universe of discourse, A is a set of primitive features, and C; D &amp; A are two subsets of features, assuming that A ¼ C [ D and C \ D ¼ ;, where C is called the condition attribute and D is the decision attribute. The measure to describe the inexactness of approximation classifications is called the quality of approximation of X by B. It expresses the percentage of objects that can be correctly classified into class X,employing the attribute B <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">c B ðAÞ ¼ P cardðBX i Þ cardðUÞ<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>If c B ðAÞ ¼ 1 , then the decision table is consistent; otherwise, it is inconsistent.</p><p>An important issue in RST is attribute reduction in which the reduced set of attributes provides the same quality of approximation as the original set. There are two fundamental concepts in connection with this attribute reduction. The Breduct of A, denoted by RED(B), is the minimal subset of A, which provides the same quality of approximation of objects into elementary classes of B as the whole attributes of A. The B-core of A, CORE(B), is the essential part of A, which cannot be eliminated without disturbing the ability to classify objects into the elementary classes of B <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It is the intersection of all reducts.</p></div>

Therefore, the rules are presented in an ''IF condition(s) THEN decision(s)" format. The concept of the decision table is employed in this study to establish rules from fuzzy relationships, which generate rules for better forecasting results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Genetic algorithms</head><p>Genetic algorithms (GAs) were advanced by Holland <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> in 1975, and expanded by Goldberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> in 1989. GAs are search algorithms, inspired by evolution and applied in searching for the global optimum for many applications. Furthermore, GAs have been successfully applied in economic and financial prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. These algorithms encode a potential solution for a specific problem into a simple chromosome-like data structure and apply recombination operators to these structures to preserve critical information. The steps of GAs in the proposed model, based on Goldberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, are reorganized for this study, as follows:</p><p>Step 1: Initialization. This step generates the initial population containing N P chromosomes, which are used to find global optimum initial seeds, where N P is the number of individuals in each generation. Simultaneously, the probability of crossover P C , probability of mutation P M , and the maximum numbers of generations NG are also initialized.</p><p>Step 2: Evaluation. After the initialization step, each chromosome is evaluated using a user-defined fitness function. The fitness value of each string is an index of the problem's design improvement suitability and the probability of survival of reproduction in genetic algorithms.</p><p>Step 3: Check termination criteria. After the previous steps, the processes, from step 2 to 7, are repeated until the termination criteria are satisfied. The proposed algorithm is terminated if either one of the following conditions is satisfied:</p><p>1. The maximum number of generations is achieved, or 2. The same solution has not been changed for the present generation.</p><p>Step 4: Elitism mechanism. In order to ensure the propagation of the elite chromosome, GAs use the Elitism mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. This mechanism selects P% individuals, which have the best fitness values, to be the offspring of the next generation, while the remaining individuals execute the genetic operations (i.e., selection, crossover and mutation).</p><p>Step 5: Selection. Selection is a process in which suitable chromosomes from the parents' populations for the next generation are chosen. In this step, the selection of this model is tournament selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. It is both effective and computationally efficient. Pairs of chromosomes are selected at random to produce their own fitness values. The chromosomes with the best fitness values will be chosen. This step is repeated until the number of chromosomes selected is equal to the number of the population.</p><p>Step 6: Crossover. The crossover operates by swapping corresponding segments of a string representation of the parents and extends the search for a new solution. Such positional bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> implies that the schemas with long-defining lengths suffer biased disruption. In order to reduce positional bias, this model uses uniform crossover <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, which can be disruptive especially to the early generations. Uniform crossover operates as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Step 7: Mutation. The mutation is a GA mechanism. It randomly chooses a member of the population and changes one randomly chosen bit in its bit string representation. The mutation operation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Proposed concepts</head><p>As stated in the previous section, past forecasting models exhibited three major drawbacks when used to predict stock market activity: (1) utility technical indicators used to forecast stock prices represent a subjective approach because investors attempt to make knowledgeable judgments about future price trends, based on the values of the technical indicators; (2) some prerequisites, such as statistical probability distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, form the theoretical basis for constructing conventional forecasting models, but usually stock data do not follow a specific data distribution; and (3) rule presentations of stock data, produced from some data-mining algorithms, are difficult for non-professional investors to interpret <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> (i.e., the rules mined from ANN are not easily understandable). We argue that these drawbacks reduce the efficiency and applicability of the forecasting model, and to overcome these drawbacks, four novel methods are proposed in the processes of data-mining for stock price forecasting.</p><p>In the preprocess of data-mining, two objective approaches, CPDA (cumulative probability distribution approach) and MEPA (minimize entropy principle approach), are suggested to discretize each technical indicator (condition features) and daily price fluctuation (decision features) into linguistic values. There are advantages in using data discretization methods in preprocessing raw data. For example, the data dimension of a database can be reduced and simplified, and use of discrete features is usually more compact and shorter than the use of continuous ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Additionally, to reduce the amount of stock data and find the effective indicators related to the future stock price, a ''correlation matrix" can be used to select, objectively, essential technical indicators from popular indicators, used in the stock market in the preprocess.</p><p>In the model-building process, a rough set (RS) algorithm is one proper data-mining algorithm suggested to extract forecasting rules from complex stock data. In recent data-mining techniques, RS methods have provided a basis for a predictive data-mining tool that is especially helpful in dealing with vague, incomplete and uncertain data used for decision-making. Three advantages can be discovered when applying RS methods: (1) RS theory can deal with the original datasets without any additional information or statistical assumptions, unlike the probability of statistics; (2) RS theory can discover important facts hidden in datasets and express them with decision rules of natural language; and (3) the results (rules) from a RS model are easily understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Because of these advantages, RS theory has become an important theory in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge discovery in database (KDD), and data-mining (DM). Accordingly, a forecasting model using a RS algorithm to produce rules can overcome the limitations 1 of statistical methods for stock price forecasting, and the produced ''if-then" rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge applicable for investors.</p><p>Moreover, genetic algorithms (GAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> are an effective and robust method for searching for proper solutions to the problems of very large spaces or dimensions in a variety of applications, and are particularly applicable in solving multiparameter optimization problems. In the stock market, ''unexpected events," which will turbulently influence stock price, will sometimes occur. Although RS methods can extract rules effectively from past stock data, the rules to express the ''unexpected events" have very low support value, and they are usually ignored when forecasting the future. Also, the ''unexpected events" in the future may not be similar to those of the past. Therefore, to meet the ''unexpected events," we use GAs to produce ''mutation rules," which are evolved from rules extracted from RS methods, to improve classification accuracy and forecasting profit. Consequently, to deal with the unpredictable variations contained in stock markets, GAs are suggested to refine the extracted rules to enhance forecasting performance. The program of the proposed model can be downloaded on the web page <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>. 1 Some statistical distributions are presumed as a basis to construct mathematical models, but usually stock data do not follow a specific data distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Proposed model</head><p>Based on the proposed concepts above, this paper suggests a hybrid model (the overall framework of which is shown as Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), which incorporates four novel data-mining methods (including CPDA, MEPA, RST and GAs) in the forecasting processes, and provides three major phases (including six processes), as noted below.</p></div>

Data transformation and selection of essential technical indicators. In the data transformation procedure, one period of stock data is selected as an experimental stock dataset. This dataset contains five daily fundamental stock quantities (maximum price, minimum price, opening price, closing price, and stock trading volume) and the daily price fluctuation, which express the stock price change between any given day and the previous day (daily price fluctuation (t) = stock price (t) À stock price (t À 1)). The data of the five daily fundamental stock quantities is converted into the data of several popular technical analysis indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>: moving average (MA), momentum (MTM), stochastic %K (%K), stochastic %D (%D), relative strength index (RSI), psychology line (PSY), Williams' percent range (%R), volume ratio (VR), volume (Volume), and accumulative ratio (AR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>In the procedure of selecting essential technical indicators, the popular indicators are analyzed by a ''correlation matrix" to examine their relationship degree to daily price fluctuations, and to select from the popular technical analysis indicators those essential indicators which are highly related to daily price fluctuations. The selection approach employs a statistical method, Pearson correlation with two-tailed tests, to select the essential technical analysis indicators. Pearson's Correlation Coefficient is usually signified by c. The statistical significance of r is tested using a t-test. The hypothesis for this test is: H 0 : c ¼ 0. A low p-value for this test (less than 0.05, for example) means that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. For example, price fluctuation is related significantly with MA-5, MTM-5, %K-5, %D-5, RSI-5, PSY-5, %R-5, VR-5, volume, and AR-5 (the marker ''**" in the last column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">19</ref>). essential technical indicators, the other consisting of daily price fluctuations) are fuzzified into linguistic stock datasets (the converted processes of daily price fluctuations, from numeric stock datasets to linguistic stock datasets, are demonstrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">8</ref>; the converted processes of a technical indicator, MA-5, from numeric stock datasets to linguistic stock datasets are demonstrated in Table <ref type="table">10</ref>). The dataset of essential technical indicators is discretizated by MEPA and used as a conditional attribute.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Empirical case study</head><p>To demonstrate the proposed model clearly, in this section, a one-year period of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) stock data, from 1999/06/23 to 2000/05/11 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, retrieved from Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation [54]), is employed as an experimental dataset to introduce the proposed algorithm step by step. Because the stock price on the ''ex-dividend day" fluctuates violently <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, this study removes the stock data of the ex-dividend day from the dataset (the dataset selection is from 1999/06/23, the day after the ex-dividend day, to 2000/05/11, the day before the ex-dividend day). The previous 10 months of stock data, from 1999/06 to 2000/03, is used for training, and the rest, from 2000/03 to 2000/05, is used for testing.  By using the experimental stock dataset above, each step contained in the three forecasting phases of the proposed model ((I) Preprocess; (II) Rule generation and rule refining; and (III) Return calculation and performance evaluation) is introduced and demonstrated, as follows:</p><p>Step 1: Data transformation and selection of essential technical indicators. In this step, the five fundamental quantities of TSMC stock data (opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price and trading volume) are demonstrated as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>, and are transferred into popular technical indicators by their corresponding equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. The eight essential technical indicators (condition features), selected by a correlation matrix for TMSC, are described, as follows: accumulative ratio (AR), moving average (MA), psychology line (PSY), relative strength index (RSI), stochastic %D (%D), stochastic %K (%K), volume, and Williams' percent range (%R) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">6</ref>). The daily price fluctuation of the next day (decision features) is produced by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) (shown in the last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">6</ref>).</p><p>Step 2: Data discretization by CPDA and MEPA. This step utilizes CPDA to discretize decision features and uses MEPA to discretize condition features. There are two substeps, as follows:</p><p>Use CPDA to discretize decision features This substep uses CPDA to define the numeric intervals for three linguistic values, Down ðL 1 Þ, Flat ðL 2 Þ, and Up ðL 3 Þ, used for decision features (daily price fluctuation). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">7</ref> lists the numeric intervals for the linguistic values. Based on these intervals, the membership function for the three linguistic values is established and shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. According to the membership functions shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, three membership functions and three membership degrees are produced for each datum (daily price fluctuation on the next day). In the fuzzification procedure, each datum is labeled as a linguistic value among three linguistic values, based on the maximum membership degree. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">8</ref> demonstrates the daily price fluctuation, the corresponding membership degrees for the three membership functions (l Down ; l Flat and l Up Þ, and the labeled linguistic values for the partial TSMC stock data.</p><p>Use MEPA to discretize condition features In this substep, the interval length of the 15 linguistic values for each condition feature is defined by MEPA (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">9</ref>), and thus, establishing the membership function of MEPA (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). In Table <ref type="table">10</ref>, the degree of membership for each datum is calculated by the membership function of MEPA, and the last column is the linguistic value of the datum, which is fuzzified, based on the maximum membership of the datum.</p><p>From the results of two data discretization methods, CPDA and MEPA, the linguistic condition features and the decision feature are demonstrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">11</ref>.</p><p>Step 3: Rule generation by RST. This step utilizes RST to construct decision rules from linguistic values in the above step (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">11</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">12</ref> shows the partial rules and the rule support value. ''Support" refers to how many records meet the generated decision rules in the stock dataset. For example, ''Rule 1: If AR-5 = L6 and PSY-5 = L9 and RSI-5 = L2 and Volume = L3 and K-5 = L7, then DPF next day = Up (support = 3)" indicates that there are three training records that meet the criteria of ''Rule 1."  Step 4: Accuracy and stock return improvement by GAs. This step uses genetic algorithms (GAs) to improve the accuracy and stock return of rules that are produced by RST. There are two substeps in this step, as follows:</p><p>Step 4.1: Generate initial chromosomes. This substep encodes each rule that is produced by RST in Step 3 as a chromosome in an initial population and evaluates each chromosome in each population using Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. For example, this substep encodes Rule 1 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">12</ref> into a chromosome, as shown in Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">13</ref>, the coded value of RSI-5 is ''2," which represents that the linguistic value of RSI-5 is L2. In the same way, the coded values of K-5, PSY-5, AR-5 and Volume are 7, 9, 6 and 3, which show that the linguistic values are L7, L9, L6 and L3, respectively. The coded values for MA-5, D-5 and R-5 are ''0," which denote that the rule does not contain the three condition features. Further, the forecasting stock price, DPF next d ay , means ''Up" because the coded value is ''3" (1 for Down, 2 for Fair, 3 for Up). In addition, the proposed model calculates a fitness value to evaluate each chromosome by Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</p><p>Step 4.2: Perform genetic operations. This substep refines the initial rules produced by using genetic operators, such as selection, crossover and mutation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">14</ref> shows the partial rules refined by GAs and the rule support.</p><p>In this paper, the proposed model employs a rule-filter, which selects useful rules for which rule support is greater than 1, and which deletes rules with low rule support (rule support = 1). Moreover, genetic algorithms and the proposed model utilize the same rule-filter condition (i.e., rule support is more than 1), the parameter settings of which are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Findings and conclusions</head><p>This paper has proposed a new hybrid model, based on four novel methods (CDPA, MEPA, RST and GA), to promote stock market forecasting performance. From the performance evaluation data in the above section, we can conclude that the main objective of this paper has been reached. Furthermore, by examining the performance data carefully, we also ascertain that four important findings for the proposed model emerge, as follows:</p><p>(1) The proposed model produces a positive stock return, whether the market is bullish or bearish.</p><p>Based on the stock return for the Buy-and-Hold approach (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">18</ref>), it has been shown that, from 2000 to 2005, there were three bear markets <ref type="bibr">(2000, 2002, and 2003)</ref> and three bull markets <ref type="bibr">(2001, 2004, and 2005)</ref>. From the stock return evaluations shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">18</ref>, it is clear that the proposed model produces a positive stock return for each dataset. This evidence points to the exceptional ability of the proposed model to mine correct price patterns in the stock market.</p><p>(2) The proposed model performs outstandingly when the stock market is in a nearly complete bull market (upside trend)</p><p>or bear market (downside trend). Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>  making a good stock return when the stock market was in a pure upward trend in 2001, the proposed model still surpasses this approach. These performance evaluations prove that the proposed model can extract tinier fluctuations in the stock price than the other three models when the stock market is in an almost pure bull market or bear market. (3) The three listed data-mining models (RST, GAs and the proposed model) perform their worst when there are many violent fluctuations occurring in the stock market. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref> shows that the TAIEX fluctuated violently in 2005. The performance evaluations (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">17</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_10">18</ref>) show that the worst case of the proposed model occurred for 2005. This can be explained by the fact that there were many conflicting rules extracted from the unstable market, which contained many violent fluctuations, and therefore, the performance value of the proposed model was dramatically reduced. Additionally, this phenomenon also occurred in RST and GA. (4) Integrating RST and GA together in forecasting processes can produce a positive effect, enhancing model performance.</p><p>In the overall performance evaluation of accuracy (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">17</ref>), RST (0.553) proves marginally better than GAs (0.547), which means that RST can produce more effective rules than GAs. However, in the overall performance evaluation of stock return (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">18</ref>), GAs (722.56) are much better than RST (531.93), which tells that GAs can deal with the price variations in the stock market better than RST. From Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">17</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_10">18</ref>, we can see that the proposed hybrid model (0.601, 950.62) performs much better than RST (0.553, 531.93) and GA (0.547, 722.56) in accuracy and stock return. The evidence demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model can acquire the advantages from the two data-mining methods (RST and GA) and therefore, produce superlative results in forecasting the stock market. Besides these findings, by implementing this experiment, two advantages were discovered for the proposed model: (1) the proposed model can produce more reasonable and understandable rules, because the ''if-then" rules produced by RST can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge; and (2) the proposed model can provide stock investors with objective suggestions (forecasts) to make investment decisions in the stock market, because the proposed model produces forecasting rules based on objective stock data rather than subjective human judgments.</p><p>For future research, two approaches to refine the proposed model, in order to improve forecasting performance, are suggested: (1) employ other data discretization methods in the preprocessing phase; and (2) use other artificial intelligence algorithms in the forecasting process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
