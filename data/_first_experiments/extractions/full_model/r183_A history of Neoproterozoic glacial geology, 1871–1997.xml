<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Neoproterozoic glacial records have been discovered on 23 palaeocontinents, their rate of discovery changing little since 1871. Yet, half of all the resulting publications appeared since 2000. The history of research before 1998 is described in five stages defined by publication spikes; subsequent work is not covered because historical perspective is lacking. In stage 1 (1871-1907), 'Cambrian' (now Neoproterozoic) glaciation was recognized successively in Scotland, Australia, India, Norway, Svalbard and China. Criteria for recognition included faceted and striated pebbles in matrix-supported conglomerates resting on ice-worn bedrock pavements. In stage 2 , Neoproterozoic glaciation was shown to have been widespread in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Major textbooks summarized these findings, but the rejection of continental drift (to account for late Palaeozoic glacial dynamics) put a chill on research. In stage 3 , the occurrence of glacial deposits within carbonate successions, as well as nascent palaeomagnetic observations, suggested that Neoproterozoic glaciers reached sea-level at low palaeolatitudes, but the belated recognition of sediment gravity flowage caused glacial interpretations to be prematurely abandoned in key areas. In stage 4 (1965In stage 4 ( -1981)), the extent of Neoproterozoic glaciation was rethought in light of plate tectonics. Distinctive chemical sediments (iron + manganese formations and cap carbonates) were identified. In basic climate models, modest lowering of solar luminosity resulted in global glaciation due to ice-albedo feedback, and deglaciation due to greenhouse forcing resulted from silicate-weathering feedback in the carbon cycle. Neoproterozoic glacial geologists were blind to these ideas. In stage 5 (1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997), reliable palaeomagnetic data combined with glacial marine sedimentation models confirmed that Neoproterozoic ice sheets reached sea level close to the palaeoequator.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The first Neoproterozoic glacial deposits were found in the SW of Scotland in 1871 and the rate of their discovery on 23 palaeocontinents and microcontinents was essentially linear until 1992 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.1). However, half of all the papers (n ¼ 811) written on them before the end of 2008 were published in the previous 10 years (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.2). This surge in activity is the justification for the present volume, but this history ends at 1997. We lack historical perspective on the last decade and the endpoint eliminates the need to weigh any of the author's own contributions on this topic.</p><p>This chapter begins by placing the recognition of the Port Askaig boulder beds of Scotland as glaciogenic in its historical context, coming in 1871 on the heels of the discoveries of late Palaeozoic glacial deposits in India, Australia and South Africa. Their inspiration was the Pleistocene glacial controversy of 1837-1865, which spawned both the orbital and 'greenhouse' theories of bidirectional climate change, and established the principal criteria for the recognition of past glaciation.</p><p>The history is divided into five periods punctuated by spikes in publications (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.2) associated with the 10th and 17th International Geological Congresses in Mexico City <ref type="bibr">(1906)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Moscow (1937)</ref>, respectively, the twin palaeoclimate conferences in Newcastle upon Tyne <ref type="bibr">(1963)</ref> and Ko ¨ln <ref type="bibr">(1964)</ref>, the IGCP Project 38 volume on Earth's Pre-Pleistocene Glacial Record <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hambrey &amp; Harland 1981)</ref>, and the onset of the present surge triggered in 1998.</p><p>The first period <ref type="bibr">(1871 -1908)</ref> saw the recognition of 'Lower Cambrian' glaciogenic formations in SW Scotland (1871), South Australia (1884), NE Norway (1891), western Svalbard (1898), South <ref type="bibr">China (1904) and</ref><ref type="bibr">NW India (1908)</ref>. It ended with overviews of Late Palaeozoic and Lower Cambrian ('possibly Pre-Cambrian') glaciations by Edgeworth <ref type="bibr">David (1907a, b)</ref> at the 10th IGC, and the winning-over of a skeptical Geological Society in London by a fellow Australian <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Howchin 1908)</ref>. Faceted and striated clasts in diamictites were the decisive criteria for glaciogenesis, with a striated subglacial pavement beautifully exposed beneath 'Reusch's Moraine' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.3) in Finnmark, Norway, for good measure.</p><p>The second period  saw Neoproterozoic glacial deposits recognized in southern, central and western Africa, central and northern Asia, eastern and western North America and eastern South America (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.1, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.1). It was evident that glaciation 'at or just before the beginning of the Cambrian' had been more extreme than in the Pleistocene, possibly equal to the composite Late Palaeozoic glaciations of Gondwanaland. These findings were highlighted in a Symposium on Palaeozoic and Pre-Cambrian Climates at the 17th IGC <ref type="bibr">(1937)</ref> in Moscow. Major textbooks made note of these developments (Ko ¨ppen <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">&amp; Wegener 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Brooks 1922</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Brooks , 1926;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Coleman 1926</ref>).</p><p>In the third period <ref type="bibr">(1942 -1964)</ref>, nascent evidence from palaeomagnetism and from the occurrence of glacial deposits atop thick carbonate-dominated successions in the North Atlantic region and within such successions in central and southern Africa implied that Neoproterozoic ice sheets had reached sea level in low palaeolatitudes. This inference met resistance and, after the discovery of turbidity currents as a cause of graded bedding <ref type="bibr">(1950)</ref>, some diamictites were reinterpreted as mass-flow deposits of non-glacial origin. These issues were discussed at major conferences on Palaeoclimates in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, <ref type="bibr">England (1963), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ko ¨ln, Germany (1964)</ref>. The radiation of macrofauna following soon after the 'infra-Cambrian' ice age was often remarked upon.</p><p>The fourth period <ref type="bibr">(1965)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1966)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1967)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1968)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1969)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1970)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1971)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1972)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1973)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1974)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1975)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1976)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1977)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1978)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1979)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1980)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref> was notable for a detailed restudy of the classic Port Askaig Tillite, debate over the roles of true polar wander and plate tectonics in the distribution of glaciogenic deposits, and the recognition of widespread postglacial 'cap dolomites' and syn-glacial iron and manganese formations, features not known from Phanerozoic glaciations. Climate modelling received a kick-start when simple energybalance calculations suggested that the Earth could freeze over from pole to pole due to ice-albedo feedback in response to lowering of the solar constant by a few percent. Such a 'white Earth' disaster was shown to be self-reversing because of negative climate feedback associated with the geochemical cycle of carbon, but geologists were unaware of these developments.</p><p>In the fifth period <ref type="bibr">(1982 -1997)</ref>, Neoproterozoic diamictites were increasingly interpreted in light of glacial marine sedimentation models and, combined with reliable palaeomagnetic data, proved that ice sheets had reached sea level close to the palaeoequator. The 'Snowball Earth' hypothesis, adapted from climate and planetary science, was advanced as a parsimonious explanation for low-latitude glaciation, associated iron (+manganese) deposits and (later) cap carbonates. Initially ignored, the strong negative reaction to this hypothesis on the part of Neoproterozoic glacial sedimentologists will in future be seen as the most striking feature of the post-1998 period.</p><p>Prologue: discovery of the Port Askaig Tillite and its historical scientific context [On the stratified rocks of Islay.] 'If . . . we compare the embedded boulders of granite [in the schist] with the granites found in situ throughout the Highlands, we feel the necessity of tracing them to another source, and hope we do not overstep the bounds of prudent speculation in suggesting that those erratics are the reassorted materials of some great Northern Continent that has yielded to the ceaseless gnawing tooth of time, leaving scattered fragments as wreckage of its former greatness, and that the material of which the mass is composed have in time, deeper than we have hitherto suspected, been transported by the agency of ice.' <ref type="bibr">James Thomson, F.G.S. 1871</ref>.

In his richly detailed sedimentological study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b324">Spencer (1971)</ref> describes the Port Askaig as lying 'at the same horizon, between two carbonate-rich formations, for 700 km from NE Scotland to western Ireland'. It is now thought to be the oldest of three distinct glaciogenic horizons within the Dalradian Supergroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(McCay et al. 2006</ref>) -older and younger Cryogenian and middle Ediacaran in age. James Thomson's speculation (see above) about a 'great Northern Continent' as the source of the glacial debris turned out to be true <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Cawood et al. 2003)</ref>, although that continent did survive the 'gnawing tooth of time' after all. It is North America, or more precisely, its pre-Pangaean antecedent Laurentia. It was merely displaced from the Dalradian in the early Eocene, when Greenland separated from NW Europe. The Port Askaig was deposited at palaeolatitudes near 258S according to reliable palaeomagnetic data from mafic dykes, lavas and sills of the marginally older (723 -718 Ma) Franklin Igneous Suite of Arctic Laurentia <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Evans 2000)</ref>. It accumulated on a marine shelf, subject to repeated subaerial exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b324">(Spencer 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Johnston 1993</ref>), situated at the then southeastern margin  Late Palaeozoic glaciation and the theory of continental drift  <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Howchin 1912)</ref>. A Permo-Carboniferous diamictite in the Talchir coal basin of NE India <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Blanford et al. 1859</ref>) was shown to have been deposited by grounded, northward(!)-flowing glaciers <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Fedden 1875;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Koken 1907)</ref>. The late Carboniferous Dwyka Tillite in Natal, South Africa, rests on a pavement scratched and grooved by onshore(!)-flowing glaciers <ref type="bibr" target="#b329">(Sutherland 1870)</ref>. Ironically, these findings had been inspired by the glacial interpretation of a Permian-age diamictite in England <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">(Ramsay 1855</ref>) that proved to be non-glacial in origin. By 1907 it was evident that with continents in fixed relative positions, no amount of polar wander could prevent early Permian glaciation in the southern hemisphere from extending to within 108 latitude of the palaeoequator, while in the northern hemisphere tropical warmth stretched to the pole <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Koken 1907;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Irving 1956</ref>). 'The Permian ice age poses an unsolvable problem to all models that do not dare to assume horizontal displacements of the continents', wrote a 32-year-old German meteorologist <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">(Wegener 1912)</ref>. With the Atlantic and Indian oceans closed up, however, all the glacial action could be contained poleward of 458S palaeolatitude, comparable to the extent of northern hemisphere glaciation in the Pleistocene. Moreover, a radial pattern of flow could then be inferred, centred on south-central Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">(Martin 1981)</ref>. 'This would take everything mysterious away from the phenomenon' <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">(Wegener 1912)</ref>. The distribution of Late Palaeozoic glacial deposits was prime motivation for Wegener's theory of continental displacement, or drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">(Martin 1981)</ref>. Had he lived, vindication in the form of plate tectonics would have come to Wegener at the age of 87.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Pleistocene glacial controversy</head><p>Interest in pre-Quaternary glaciation arose in the wake of the most acrimonious and far-reaching controversy in 19th-century geology, the brouhaha over the glacial theory for Pleistocene tills, erratic boulders and associated landforms (moraines, drumlins, eskers, kame-and-kettle, fluted ground, grooved bedrock, crag-and-tail, roches moutonne ´es, whaleback rocks, cirques and hanging valleys, horns and are ˆtes, U-shaped valleys and fjords). Glacial theory -that most of northern Europe and North America had been sculpted by enormous and dynamic ice sheets in the geologically recent past -was independently proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Esmark (1824)</ref> in Norway, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Dobson (1925)</ref> in the USA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">Venetz (1830)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Charpentier (1837)</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Switzerland and Bernhardi (1832)</ref> in Germany. None of these papers -published in major journals by reputable professors <ref type="bibr">(Esmark and Bernhardi)</ref>, engineers <ref type="bibr">(Venetz and Charpentier)</ref> and an industrialist (Dobson)raised a ripple. No geologist ever overturned conventional wisdom with a single paper.</p><p>Conventional theory held that these features were products of floods -meltwater floods resulting from dam bursts in the Alps (cf. de Saussure, von Humboldt, von Buch, de Beaumont) or iceberg-laden floods of Arctic origin in northern <ref type="bibr">Europe and North America (cf. Sefstro ¨m, Murchison, Hitchcock, Lyell)</ref>. The controversy erupted when glacial theory was taken up by a young, ambitious, energetic and multilingual Swiss palaeoichthyologist <ref type="bibr">(Agassiz 1837</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Agassiz , 1840))</ref>. A recent convert to glacial theory, Agassiz linked it to the extinction of the boreal megafauna (e.g. mammoth, mastodon, woolly rhinoceros, giant deer), a linkage easily disproved <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Forbes 1846)</ref>. He tied the end of the glacial period to the uplift of the Alps, exactly opposite to the view of Charpentier, his primary glaciological tutor, and laughable to those who knew that Alpine orogeny began in the Eocene. Of the geological establishment, only the former arch-Diluvialist William Buckland (Oxford University) was quickly won over to glacial theory.</p><p>The climax of Agassiz's campaign in support of glacial theory came in 1840 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Davies 1968</ref>), when he and Buckland toured the British Isles, finding varied and widespread evidence of glacial action <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Agassiz 1842)</ref>. The evidence included tills (boulder clays) with polished, faceted and striated clasts, moraines marking the limits of former glaciers, streamlined bedrock and perched terraces resulting from ice-dammed lakes. At first, Agassiz's findings aroused great interest in the English-speaking world, but within months of his tour the glacial hypothesis was rejected by most geologists as unworkable (contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Lyell 1840</ref><ref type="bibr">Lyell , 1841;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Hitchcock 1841)</ref>. Thereafter, glacial theory would languish until a new generation of Scottish geologists undertook systematic surveys that provided (to their own surprise) overwhelming evidence that glacial theory was correct after all <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">(Ramsay 1860;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Jamieson 1862</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Jamieson , 1863</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Jamieson , 1865;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">A. Geikie 1863</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">A. Geikie , 1865;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">J. Geikie 1874)</ref>. Agassiz had to wait 25 years for vindication. Had he lived, Jens Esmark would have been 99 years old.</p><p>Lyell, who had 'an undeniable penchant for the skilful defence of lost causes' <ref type="bibr">(Cunningham 1990, p. 247)</ref>, never completely gave up on his decidedly non-uniformitarian iceberg-drift hypothesis. Conversely, it is insufficiently appreciated today that many of the criteria still used to distinguish ancient glaciogenic deposits were clearly spelled out over 170 years ago by <ref type="bibr">Esmark, Dobson, Venetz, Bernhardi, Charpentier and Agassiz.</ref> The problem of bidirectional climate change and the discovery of the 'greenhouse' effect</p><p>The idea of a glacial period, or 'Ice Age' <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">(Schimper 1837)</ref>, was not controversial to geologists per se: characteristic fauna and flora now live c. 1000 km farther north of their occurrences in the 'Drift' <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">(Smith 1836</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b321">(Smith , 1839;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Forbes 1846)</ref>. However, to physicists interested in climate, it came as a shock. They had assumed the the Earth's climate was slowly cooling over time due to the dissipation of primordial heat in the Solar System according to the nebular hypothesis. This was consistent with undisputed palaeobotanical evidence (e.g. palm fronds in Switzerland) that most regions were warmer in the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic than they are today. If the climate could change dramatically in either direction, previously unknown factors must be at work in the climate system.</p><p>It fell to the Irish physicist, mountaineer and orator John <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">Tyndall (1861</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b334">Tyndall ( , 1863) )</ref> to demonstrate experimentally that certain gaseous molecules in the atmosphere, notably water vapour and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), absorb infrared radiation ('obscure rays') emitted by the Earth but are transparent to sunlight. Fourier (1824) had previously mentioned the possibility of such a 'greenhouse' effect, but had rejected it as quantitatively unimportant. For <ref type="bibr">Tyndall (1863, p. 204)</ref>, water vapour provides 'a blanket more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man'. Radiative energy balance is maintained because the atmosphere 'constitutes a local dam, by which the temperature of the Earth's surface is deepened: the dam, however, finally overflows, and we give to space all that we receive from the Sun' <ref type="bibr">(Tyndall 1863, p. 205)</ref>.</p><p>Tyndall understood that water vapour cannot be the ultimate cause of climate change, because its concentration is itself a strong function of temperature. It amplifies any given climate change but cannot be its ultimate cause. On the other hand, the content of CO 2 in the atmosphere, or any of the hydrocarbon gases, can vary independently. 'It is not, therefore, necessary to assume alterations in the density and height of the atmosphere to account for different amounts of heat being preserved to the Earth at different times', wrote <ref type="bibr">Tyndall (1861, p. 277)</ref>, 'a slight change in its variable constituents would suffice for this. Such changes may in fact have produced all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists have revealed' [italics added].</p><p>Unknown to Tyndall, a prematurely deceased French ceramicist had already established the basis for the changes in CO 2 that he required, through the geochemical cycle of carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Ebelmen 1845</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Ebelmen , 1847</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Hunt 1880;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Berner &amp; Maasch 1996)</ref>.</p></div>

The deposits in the extreme NE of Norway made the biggest initial impact. Hans <ref type="bibr">Reusch (1852</ref><ref type="bibr">Reusch ( -1922))</ref>, then Director of the Norwegian Geological Survey, found them around the head of Varangerfjorden, not far from the Russian border. <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">Reusch (1891)</ref> describes hills underlain by up to 50 m of non-stratified, matrix-supported conglomerate in which cobbles of Archaean gneiss and granite predominate, but which also carry smaller clasts of dolomite with facets and nonparallel striations identical to those found in Quaternary tills throughout Norway. On the coast of the fjord near the lighthouse at Bigganjargga, about 40 minutes' walk east from Karlebotn, <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">Reusch (1891)</ref> found an isolated ridge of diamictite c. 70 m long Â 8 m wide Â 3 m high <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Bjørlykke 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Edwards 1975)</ref>. The ridge belongs to the older (Smalfjord Formation) of two glaciogenic intervals in the region, and is onlapped and draped by shallow-marine sandstone.

When they reduced solar irradiance by a few percent, surface temperatures fell below freezing everywhere due to runaway snow and ice-albedo feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Eriksson 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Sellers 1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b315">Sellers , 1990;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Budyko 1969</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">North 1990)</ref>. Although decadal to millenial solar variability is only c. 0.1%, solar luminosity is thought to have slowly increased by 25-30% since 4.5 Ga due to the production of helium in the Sun's core. The energy-balance calculations were therefore assumed to be in error because they predicted that the Earth should have been permanently frozen: irradiance roughly 25% higher than present is required to overcome the albedo of an icecovered planet, which reflects over 60% of the sunlight it receives. This problem was a stimulus for the nascent science of climate modelling. However, the 'white Earth' instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">(Wetherald &amp; Manabe 1975</ref>) turned out to be a robust feature not only of simple energy-balance models but also of most atmospheric general-circulation models.</p><p>In 1981, three planetary scientists proposed a solution to the 'white Earth' problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(Walker et al. 1981)</ref>. They appealed to the geochemical cycle of carbon (which is not accommodated in physical climate models because of its timescale of c. 10 6 years). CO 2 is supplied to the ocean and atmosphere by metamorphicvolcanic outgassing and is consumed by silicate rock weathering. The latter is temperature-dependent because of the direct effect of temperature on reaction kinetics and also because moisture in wet regions, where most weathering occurs, increases with temperature (Clausius -Clapeyron relationship). The temperature-dependence of weathering provides a negative climate feedback (abiotic Gaia) that acts as a natural thermostat. If global temperatures rise (or fall) for any reason, CO 2 is consumed at a faster (or slower) rate, thereby limiting the temperature change. In effect, the feedback slowly adjusts the atmospheric CO 2 concentration to maintain a balance between CO 2 sources and sinks. As solar luminosity increased over geological time, atmospheric CO 2 concentration adjusted downwards, keeping surface temperatures within the range suitable for life. This simple hypothesis not only went a long way towards solving the 'faint young Sun' paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">(Sagan &amp; Mullen 1972)</ref>, it rationalized long-term climate change while explaining why such changes were limited in magnitude.</p><p>In the penultimate paragraph of their classic paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">Walker et al. (1981)</ref> suggested that silicate weathering feedback had been responsible for averting a 'white Earth'. They added, however, that 'if a global glaciation were to occur, the rate of silicate weathering should fall nearly to zero, and carbon dioxide should accumulate in the atmosphere at whatever rate it is released from volcanoes. Even the present rate of release would yield 1 bar of carbon dioxide in only 20 Ma. The resultant large greenhouse effect should melt the ice cover in a geologically short period of time' <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(Walker et al. 1981)</ref>. If a 'white Earth' did occur, it would be self-reversing. Accordingly, its occurrence in deep time could not be ruled out a priori. This, in a nutshell, is the climatological concept behind the 'Snowball Earth' hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">Walker et al. (1981)</ref> made no reference to ancient glaciation, Neoproterozoic or otherwise. This was not because they were unaware of geology. On the contrary, the 'faint young Sun' problem was brought into focus for Walker by his participation in the Precambrian Palaeobiology Research Group (PPRG) organized by micropalaeontologist J. William Schopf. (Third author Kasting and palaeomagnetist Joe Kirschvink were PPRG participants later in the decade.) By 1981, Harland's great infra-Cambrian glaciation had fallen off the radar screen. Palaeomagnetism, on which high hopes were pinned, had encountered problems. The foremost was the susceptibility of sediments to lowtemperature chemical remagnetization (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">McCabe &amp; Elmore, 1989)</ref>. Overcoming these problems would require time-consuming stepwise chemical and thermal demagnetization, studies of magnetic mineralogy, 'field tests' to constrain the age of remnant magnetic components, and more sensitive magnetometers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1982-1997: the gathering storm</head><p>There were many developments during this period -burgeoning information regarding glaciomarine processes and deposits, widespread use of carbon isotopes as a tool for correlation, acquisition of reliable palaeomagnetic constraints on palaeolatitudes of proximal glaciomarine deposits, increased awareness of the sedimentological peculiarites of post-glacial 'cap' carbonates, and growing interest in causal mechanisms for low-latitude glaciation.</p><p>Glaciomarine deposits are more likely than their terrestrial counterparts to be preserved in the geological record because they are less susceptible to erosion, but ice-proximal processes in the marine environment are difficult to study because they occur underwater and often under ice. Nevertheless, much has been gleaned from geomorphic and seismic surveys of polar continental shelves backed up by drilling programmes (e.g. Elverhøi 1984; <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">Powell 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b279">Powell , 1990;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Alley et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barrett 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Boulton 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">King et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b280">Powell &amp; Domack 1995)</ref>. A growing emphasis on glaciomarine processes and deposits is reflected in many books written during this period (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Molnia 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Drewry 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dowdeswell &amp; Scourse 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anderson &amp; Ashley 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Hambrey 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Benn &amp; Evans 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Anderson 1999)</ref>. Neoproterozoic glacial geology benefited enormously from these developments, although the complexity of facies architecture poses a challenge given the limited three-dimensional exposure of ancient deposits and weak or non-existent constraints on rates of accumulation.</p><p>Beginning in the mid-1950s, oxygen isotopes have been used as a basic tool for stratigraphic correlation of Quaternary marine carbonates and for estimating seawater temperatures and global ice-sheet volumes. Unfortunately, Neoproterozoic carbonates do not preserve their original mineralogy, and their oxygen isotope compositions are seriously compromised by aqueous diagenesis. However, carbonate rocks buffer the isotopic composition of the relatively low concentration of carbon in aqueous solution. Consequently, the carbon isotopic compositions of carbonate rocks resist alteration. Beginning in the mid-1980s, carbon isotopes were increasingly used for stratigraphic correlation of Neoproterozoic carbonates and to a lesser extent for organic-rich shales <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Knoll et al. 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Knoll &amp; Walter 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Kaufman et al. 1997)</ref>. Studies show that Neoproterozoic glaciogenic formations are typically bracketed by negative isotopic excursions. The excursions are reproduceable and approximately five times larger in magnitude than spatial or depth variations in the modern ocean. Because atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were likely higher in the Neoproterozoic than today because of the dimmer Sun, a larger reservoir of dissolved inorganic carbon should have damped spatial and depth variations of d 13 C in Neoproterozoic oceans. Therefore, the observed isotopic excursions are most easily explained as secular variations. Their regular occurrence directly before and after glaciogenic sedimentation suggests that glaciation was roughly synchronous in many areas, even if not every isotopic excursion is associated with glaciation. For those who accepted these basic principles, the arguments for diachronous glaciation receded as the body of Neoproterozoic carbon isotope data grew.</p><p>The first robust palaeomagnetic support for glaciation at sea level in low palaeolatitudes came from the Elatina Formation in South Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Embleton &amp; Williams 1986</ref>). The formation is a glaciomarine unit comprised of reddish sandstone, siltstone and diamictite <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(Lemon &amp; Gostin 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">Williams et al. 2008)</ref>, and a 10-m-thick interval of rhythmically laminated siltstone has been the subject of repeated palaeomagnetic studies. The palaeopole determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Embleton &amp; Williams (1986)</ref> implies a palaeolatitude of c. 58 and, although no field test was performed, the result is considered reliable because the natural remanent magnetization is stably carried by detrital haematite. At the time of the study, the laminations were considered to be annual varves, and the rhythmic bundles of 12-14 laminae were thought to represent sunspot cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b352">(Williams 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b356">Williams &amp; Sonett 1985)</ref>. Later, they were reinterpreted as tidal rhythmites <ref type="bibr" target="#b353">(Williams 1989)</ref>, supporting a glaciomarine origin for the associated diamictites.

Ubiquitous subparallel lamination is defined by oscillatory variation in peloid size. His photographs show well-sorted, coarse-grained peloids in layers only one or two peloids deep. Where coarse peloids form the base of a layer, they commonly rest on facets, apparently resulting from abrasion. The layers are not laterally continuous, and low-angle crosslamination is ubiquitous.

This suggestion requires that primary production be maintained in the absence of upwellings, which is the overwhelmingly predominant nutrient flux in the modern ocean. Upwellings would not be necessary if organic matter did not settle, but then alkalinity would not build up in the deep nor would a vertical isotopic gradient develop. This and the physical implausibility of prolonged (.10 000 years) ocean stagnation (in the absence of an ice cover) make the overturn hypothesis unconvincing, despite its popular appeal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Kennedy (1996)</ref> proposed that cap carbonates represent nonskeletal analogues of carbonates deposited (in low latitudes) during times of Quaternary deglaciation according to the 'coral reef' hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Berger 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">Opdyke &amp; Walker 1992)</ref>. This results from the hypsometry of ocean basins. When sea level is lowered due to ice-sheet growth, the area of shallow shelves and inland seas is disproprotionately reduced. These areas are favoured for carbonate burial because the sediment never encounters undersaturated deepwaters. When these areas are lost, all carbonate production occurs in the open ocean and the alkalinity of deepwaters increases. Upon deglaciation, alkalinityrich waters flood the shelves, depositing carbonate and releasing CO 2 to the atmosphere. The process can account for much of the glacial -interglacial variation in pCO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">(Opdyke &amp; Walker 1992</ref>) and thus provides a positive climate feedback. This mechanism must have contributed to cap carbonates, but the estimated average thickness of carbonate produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">(Ridgwell et al. 2003</ref>) is only approximately one-tenth of the average thickness of cap dolostones of 18.5 m <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman et al. 2007, Table 2.1)</ref>.

If cap carbonates were eroded during glacial readvances, they would be present as clasts in glacial deposits, which they are not.</p><p>Nearly 70 papers concerning cap carbonates appeared in the decade after 1997.

(1981)</ref> provided the conceptual basis for a selfreversing global glaciation from the point of the initial 'white Earth' (ice-albedo) instability. They did not speculate on how the climate ever reached that point because they credited silicateweathering feedback with its avoidance. However, a number of causative theories (not mutually exclusive) were proposed between 1971 and 1997 to explain Neoproterozoic glaciation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.3).</p><p>Carbonate burial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">Roberts (1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Roberts ( , 1976) )</ref> was struck by the fact that the Cryogenian glaciation was preceded by thick successions of shallow-water carbonate strata in the North Atlantic (Greenland, Svalbard and the British Isles), western North America and central Africa. He postulated a period of anomalous carbonate burial in which atmospheric CO 2 was sequestered, producing an 'anti-greenhouse' effect. He did not give any reason why this might have occurred. It would require a rise in the global rate of silicate weathering relative to the rate of CO 2 outgassing (see below; Continental distribution and Continental break-up).</p><p>Large orbital obliquity. The Australian sedimentologist George E. Williams always had an eye on 'the big picture' and possessed an early appetite for planetary orbital mechanics. Impressed by the prevalence of varves (i.e. rhythmic lamination, supposedly seasonal) and other seasonal indicators such as polygonal sand wedges associated with Neoproterozoic glaciogenic strata <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Chumakov 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b324">Spencer 1971)</ref>, he proposed that the Earth's obliquity (i.e. the angle between the equatorial and ecliptic planes) oscillated between large (e.g. Neoproterozoic) and small (e.g. Phanerozoic) values <ref type="bibr" target="#b348">(Williams 1972)</ref>. When the angle was large, the seasonal cycle was strong everywhere; when small, the seasons did not differ greatly in low latitudes (except in strongly monsoonal areas). In addition, as the angle increased, the meridional insolation gradient declined and actually reversed (i.e. greater annual insolation at the poles than at the equator) whenever the angle exceeded 548. <ref type="bibr" target="#b348">Williams (1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b349">Williams ( , 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b350">Williams ( , 1975) )</ref> inferred that when the obliquity was very large, low latitudes were subject to glaciation preferentially. As low latitudes cover more area than high latitudes, there should be more ice (and higher planetary albedo) during periods of low-latitude glaciation than when ice is limited to the poles. Accordingly, glacial periods occur when obliquity is large and when there is strong seasonality everywhere (contrary to the Wegener -Milankovic hypothesis that ice-sheet growth is favoured by cool summers and low seasonality). Under large obliquity, glaciation at the poles is precluded by intense summertime insolation.</p><p>The large obliquity hypothesis was strengthened by the discovery of 2.5-m-deep sand wedges associated with the Elatina Formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">(Williams &amp; Tonkin 1985)</ref>, which, combined with palaeomagnetic evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Embleton &amp; Williams 1986)</ref>, indicates strong seasonality at low palaeolatitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">(Williams 1993</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">Maloof et al. 2002)</ref>. In the Phanerozoic, deep periglacial sand wedges occur only in middle and high latitudes, where seasonal forcing is strong <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Lachenbruch 1962)</ref>. With large obliquity, seasonality is strong at all latitudes.</p><p>Like any theory, large obliquity was not without difficulties. Although a large (and chaotic) obliquity could have been imparted on the early Earth by stochastic accretion <ref type="bibr">(Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993)</ref>, obliquity cannot oscillate between large and small angles because of 'entrapment' at small angles by gravitational attraction between the Moon and the Earth's equatorial bulge <ref type="bibr">(Laskar et al. 1993)</ref>. Therefore, the theory was revised such that obliquity was persistently large until Ediacaran times, when it was rapidly reduced to small angles before the Cambrian <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">(Williams 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b355">(Williams , 2000))</ref>. This proved difficult to replicate in models or justify from orbital theory (Ne ´ron de Surgy &amp; Laskar 1997; <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">Williams et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Hoffman &amp; Maloof 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Pais et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Donnadieu et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Levrard &amp; Laskar 2003)</ref>. Moreover, large obliquity over most of Precambrian time is at odds with a growing body of palaeomagnetic evidence that pre-Ediacaran evaporites and carbonate-dominated successions formed at latitudes inconsistent with a reversed climatic gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">(Park 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Buchan et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Evans 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Maloof et al. 2006)</ref>.

Sheldon was a sedimentary phosphorite specialist with the United States Geological Survey who developed an 'outlandish hypothesis' <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">(Sheldon 1984)</ref> for Neoproterozoic glaciation following a field excursion in northern Mongolia, where phosphorites, carbonates and glacial marine strata occur in close stratigraphic proximity. He speculated that ice rings denser than those of Saturn orbited the Archaean Earth. In the Proterozoic, sublimation thinned the rings and they became more discrete.</p><p>As the Moon pulled away from the Earth, their orbits slowly decayed and they successively entered the atmosphere. As each ring approached the Earth, its shadow caused an ice age. Upon entering the atmosphere and before the next ring approached, the shadow was lost and greenhouse gases were added, causing a warm interglacial. Once the final ring had fallen, the tropics were shadowless for the first time. Ocean overturning driven by the steepened climatic gradient led to phosphogenesis and organic diversification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Sheldon (1984)</ref> noted that seasonality would be greatest in glacial times, consistent with Williams' (1993) observation, because the rings cast shadows only on the winter hemisphere. Again, this is contrary to the Wegener -Milankovic theory of ice ages, which posits that ice sheets grow when summers (not winters) are cool and seasonality is weak (Ko ¨ppen <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">&amp; Wegener 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Milankovic 1941)</ref>.</p><p>Continental distribution.

Global cooling is therefore consistent with sedimentological and palaeomagnetic evidence for an unusual preponderance of low-latitude continents in the Neoproterozoic, 'a situation that has not been encountered at any subsequent time in Earth history' <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>. Equatorward displacement of the continents also changes the planetary albedo: the tropical ocean is a strong absorber of sunlight, unlike land areas (minimally vegetated in the Neoproterozoic) and the fog-bound polar oceans, which are relatively good reflectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>. Moreover, a positive albedo feedback would result from the enlargement of tropical land area that would accompany any glacioeustatic fall in sea level <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>.</p><p>A palaeomagnetist, <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Kirschvink (1992)</ref> accepted the low-latitude result for the Elatina glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Embleton &amp; Williams 1986</ref>) but rejected the large-obliquity hypothesis because of the cooccurrence of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits and thick carbonatedominated successions. If the meridional climatic gradient were reversed, the carbonate belts would move from low latitudes to the poles, 'where the glaciers (in Williams' model) should not encounter them' <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>. He was therefore compelled to assume that if ice sheets reached sea level close to the equator, higher latitudes must have been glaciated as well, wherever ablation did not exceed precipitation. He envisaged an ocean largely covered by pack ice, perhaps with 'warm tropical "puddles" in the sea of ice, shifting slightly from north to south with the seasons' <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>. At the 1989 PPRG meeting at UCLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">(Maugh 1989)</ref>, he proposed that the 'white Earth' disaster had actually occured in the Neoproterozoic, perhaps repeatedly, and that each pan-glacial period was abruptly terminated when the slow build up of CO 2 reached a critical level, as deduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">Walker et al. (1981)</ref>. He attributed the deposition of banded iron-formation during Neoproterozoic glaciation to ocean stagnation and deepwater anoxia, as previously proposed by <ref type="bibr">Martin (1964b)</ref>, and he predicted that the abrupt climate switches accompanying glaciation and deglaciation should be represented in widely separate areas by lithologically similar strata, a result of the global scale of the climatic fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992)</ref>. He called the glacial state a 'Snowball' Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">(Maugh 1989</ref>) to highlight the central role of planetary albedo in the phenomenon. It is an evocative description of how the late Cryogenian Earth might have looked from outer space.</p><p>Impact ejecta. Impact ejecta figured in discussions of Neoproterozoic glaciation in two completely different ways. They were proposed as an alternative emplacement mechanism for diamictite, implying that the low-latitude and carbonate-associated glacial problem was a chimera <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">(Oberbeck et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Rampino 1994)</ref>. This was a small reenactment of the pebbly mudflow challenge of 1957 -1974. Impact ejecta aprons do in fact share many diagnostic features with glaciogenic diamictites (e.g. unsorted debris, faceted and striated erratic stones, outsized dropstones). However, continuous ejecta blankets extend only about one craterradius from the crater rim, regardless of crater size <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">(Melosh 1989)</ref>. Therefore, an improbably large flux of big impacts (roughly one Cretaceous -Tertiary sized impact every 100 ka for 200 Ma) would be required to account for the distribution of Neoproterozoic diamictites, given the low probability of their exposure at the Earth's surface today.</p><p>It was later proposed on the basis of modelling experiments that large impacts could have caused Neoproterozoic glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bendtsen &amp; Bjerrum 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Fawcett &amp; Boslough 2002)</ref>. The models suggest that short-term (,10 year) shielding of sunlight by ejecta from a Cretaceous -Tertiary sized impact could cause the ocean surface to freeze over if seawater was as cold as today, unlike the Cretaceous ocean, which was 8-128 warmer than present.</p><p>Ocean stagnation. As the patterns of C and Sr isotope variations associated with Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic glaciations are distinct <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Kaufman et al. 1993)</ref>, the cause of glaciation might also be different. <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Kaufman et al. (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Grotzinger &amp; Knoll (1995)</ref> attempted to genetically link the isotopic patterns, glaciation and the associated Fe-and Mn-ore formations and 'cap' carbonates in a conceptual model involving prolonged ocean stagnation followed by overturn. They hypothesized that when the ocean was stagnant, organic export and subsequent respiration in anoxic deep waters would progressively enrich the surface waters in 13 C, while simultaneously creating an isotopically depleted, bicarbonate-enriched reservoir at depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Kaufman et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Grotzinger &amp; Knoll 1995)</ref>. In their model, the attendant transfer of CO 2 from the atmosphere to the deep ocean contributes to global cooling. Ultimately, the growth of sea ice triggers the formation of cold, saline, deep water, and the meridional overturning circulation is reestablished. Upwelling of alkalinityladen deepwater leads to the precipitation of isotopically depleted cap carbonates and the simultaneous release of CO 2 to the atmosphere, which melts the ice <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Kaufman et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Grotzinger &amp; Knoll 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The parsimony of the model temporarily outshone its flawed foundation. Short of covering the ocean with ice, physical stagnation (as distinct from dynamic stratification) on geological timescales is implausible because the energy driving the upwelling flux (the rate-limiting step in the overturning circulation) derives from winds and tides <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">(Wunsch 2002)</ref>. Winds and tides are not so easily turned off. Moreover, if the surface ocean was ever deprived of nutrients upwelled from depth, primary production would crash, depriving the deep of its alkalinity pump and the isotopic gradient of its driver. To its credit, the overturn hypothesis at least lined up all the key observations in the same viewfinder: glaciation, isotopes, iron formations and cap carbonates.</p><p>Biocatalysed weathering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Carver &amp; Vardavas (1994)</ref> constructed a time-dependent model of the Earth's mean surface temperature controlled by the geochemical cycle of carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(Walker et al. 1981)</ref>. They parameterized CO 2 outgassing as having declined rapidly before and more slowly after 3.5 Ma. The solar flux rose almost linearly, and the consumption of CO 2 through silicate weathering was shaped by the rapid growth of 90% of the present continental crust between 3.5 and 2.0 Ga, and by stepwise increases in weathering efficiency (i.e. the rate of CO 2 consumption for any given pCO 2 ) resulting from biological colonizations of the land <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">(Schwartzman &amp; Volk 1991)</ref>. The first colonization (microbial) is assumed to have occurred before 3.5 Ga. The second (organisms unspecified) supposedly occurred between 1.2 and 0.7 Ga, and the third in the middle Phanerozoic in response to the rise of vascular plants. The observed enrichment in 13 C of most pre-Ediacaran carbonates (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Knoll et al. 1986</ref>) is cited in support of the middle (and largest) step in weathering efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Carver &amp; Vardavas 1994)</ref>, although the isotopic pattern requires an increase in fractional organic burial as opposed to overall carbon burial. Increased Neoproterozoic biocatalysed weathering receives some support from micropalaeontology <ref type="bibr">(Horodyski &amp; Knauth 1994)</ref>, molecular divergence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Heckman et al. 2001</ref>) and clay mineralogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Kennedy et al. 2006)</ref>, but remains controversial. The modelled temperature curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Carver &amp; Vardavas 1994)</ref> feature two relatively cold intervals in Earth history, early Palaeoproterozoic in response to continental growth and mid-Neoproterozoic in response to the prescribed increase in biocatalysed weathering.</p><p>Continental break-up. Supercontinents tend to be dry because most land is far from the ocean. Upon fragmentation, new continental margins are created and land overall is brought closer to the source of moisture. As silicate-weathering is catalysed by moisture as well as by temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(Walker et al. 1981)</ref>, continental break-up should result in lower pCO 2 and a colder global climate. Cooling will be most severe if rifting occurs in the tropics, and least so for rifting in the polar regions where chemical weathering rates are low. Continental break-up in tropical Pangaea was followed by the coolest period (Late Jurassic -Early Cretaceous) of the Mesozoic era <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Frakes et al. 1992)</ref>; break-up in the polar North Atlantic by the warmest period (Early Eocene) of the Cenozoic <ref type="bibr" target="#b374">(Zachos et al. 2001)</ref>. This is consistent with Cryogenian cooling, related to the break-up and dispersal of equatorial Rodinia beginning c. 800 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Li et al. 2008</ref>). These ideas have recently been tested with a simplified atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a model of the geochemical cycle of carbon <ref type="bibr">(Donnadieu et al. 2004a, b)</ref>.</p><p>It is therefore difficult to accept the argument that Neoproterozoic glaciation could be explained in terms of a close spatial (as well as temporal) association with rift valleys and rifted margins, without recourse to extreme climate states <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Eyles 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Young 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Eyles &amp; Januszczak 2003)</ref>. [In Reply to a Comment, <ref type="bibr">Young (1995b)</ref> wrote that he did not intend to imply a genetic relationship, but then his paper should have been titled, 'Was the preservation of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits on the margins of Laurentia related to the fragmentation of two supercontinents?'.] The Late Quaternary glacial maxima were arguably as cold as any time in the Phanerozoic, but moraines on the mountains of the East African rift system do not extend below c. 3.5 km above sea level <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">(Osmaston 2004</ref>). In the Red Sea rift, only a handful of the highest peaks (.4.0 km above sea level) on the Ethiopean Dome were glaciated at the Last Quaternary Maximum <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">(Osmaston 2004)</ref>. For Neoproterozoic ice sheets to have reached sea level at the same latitudes implies a drastically colder climate.</p><p>Epilogue: the long road to consensus Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.2 clearly shows that publications concerning Neoproterozoic glaciation 'took off' in the mid-1990s and possibly peaked in 2007. There is little doubt that the galvanizing factor was the Snowball Earth hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoffman &amp; Schrag 2002</ref>). In the first four years after its publication, <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Kirschvink (1992)</ref> had been cited only three times, and favourably only once <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Klein &amp; Beukes 1993)</ref>. However, as soon as it was advocated prominently <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Hoffman et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Hoffman &amp; Schrag 2000)</ref> and in the public arena <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">(Walker 2003)</ref>, the reaction was swift. This is not the place to review all the papers that have appeared since 1998: more time and more space are needed. Opinions about the nature of Neoproterozoic glaciation are now at a stalemate. Most workers agree that one, and possibly two, Cryogenian glaciations occurred simultaneously on virtually all palaeocontinents <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Evans 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Halverson 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Hoffman &amp; Li 2009</ref>; but see Eyles &amp; Januszczak 2003 for a contrary view). The basic argument is that if ice sheets reached sea level in the warmest areas (i.e. close to the palaeoequator and where thick non-skeletal carbonates accumulated), then colder areas must have been frozen as well. This argument makes no a priori assumption about correlation, but correlation follows from the premise.</p><p>The stalemate concerns the state of the ocean: was it largely ice-covered as assumed in the Snowball Earth hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Kirschvink 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoffman &amp; Schrag 2002)</ref>, or substantially ice-free as posited in the so-called slushball solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Hyde et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Peltier et al. 2004</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bendtsen 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b336">Voigt et al. 2011</ref>)? Because of subduction, direct evidence from the ocean floor has been eliminated, or survives only from post-Cryogenian (Ediacaran), regional-scale glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Kawai et al. 2008)</ref>. Those who favour the snowball model point to its ability to account for synglacial Fe-and Fe-Mn deposits, post-glacial cap carbonates, and isotopic evidence for highly elevated pCO 2 during and after glaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bao et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bao et al. , 2009))</ref>. The slushball solution does not account for these features <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">(Pollard &amp; Kasting 2005)</ref>. Those who favour the slushball solution point to evidence that the snowball hypothesis is incompatible with the fossil record <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Knoll 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b368">Xiao 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Corsetti et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Moczydlowska 2008)</ref> and also with the sedimentology of glacial deposits (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">McMechan 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Condon et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Allen &amp; E ´tienne 2008)</ref>. The biotic argument presupposes a knowledge of the limits to survival of species. The argument from sedimentology assumes knowledge of when the deposits were formed because the snowball hypothesis predicts that glaciation was 'polar' in character at the beginning and 'temperate' or 'Alaskan' at the end. Studies of modern ice-sheet stability show that outlet glaciers are buttressed by ice shelves <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Dowdeswell et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">De Angelis &amp; Skvarca 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Nick et al. 2009</ref>): iceshelf removal triggers ice-sheet deflation, with potential for ice-sheet collapse. On a Snowball Earth, the ice shelf is global. Iceshelf removal, the first step in snowball deglaciation, should trigger rapid deflation and collapse of low-latitude ice sheets. Much of the glacial sediment record on continental margins will date from this period. These deposits will bear evidence of open water (e.g. iceberg rafting and dumping, wave ripples) because open water then existed. Sedimentology is thus a clumsy means of testing the snowball hypothesis because of uncertainty over which stage of the glacial cycle is stratigraphically preserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Hoffman 2005)</ref>. Moreover, sediment fluxes cannot be estimated because chronology is lacking. Even varve chronology <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(De Geer 1912)</ref>, from which the duration of the Holocene was estimated with a fair degree of accuracy, is closed to us because of the relatively low palaeolatitudes of most Neoproterozoic deposits, where seasonality is weak. The decisive falsifying test is chronometric: any glaciation that is short-lived (,5 Ma) cannot have been a snowball glaciation because of the time required to accumulate enough CO 2 to overcome the 'white Earth's' albedo. It is the duration of the glaciation, not that of particular glacial deposits, that provides the test. The tightest existing constraint on the duration of the end-Cryogenian (Marinoan) glaciation is 19.3 + 4.2 Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Condon et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b375">Zhang et al. 2008)</ref>. The older Cryogenian (Sturtian) glaciation is virtually unconstrained, whereas the mid-Ediacaran (Gaskiers) glaciation could not have been a snowball glaciation because of its short duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Hoffman &amp; Li 2009)</ref>.</p><p>If the snowball hypothesis is not falsified geochronologically, how and when might a consensus on the nature of Cryogenian glaciation come about? The history of the Pleistocene glacial controversy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.4) may offer a preview. Agassiz's outspoken advocacy of the glacial theory of Esmark, Venetz and Bernhardi engendered much excitement, but failed to achieve consensus. In fact, with few exceptions <ref type="bibr">(James Smith, Charles Maclaren, Robert Buckland, Robert Chambers and, on-and-off, Charles Darwin)</ref>, British geologists soon turned hostile to the glacial theory and remained so from 1842 until 1860. One can track the fortunes of the theory through the writings of Charles <ref type="bibr">Lyell (1841</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Lyell ( , 1845</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Lyell ( , 1851</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Lyell ( , 1852</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Lyell ( , 1855</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Lyell ( , 1857</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Lyell ( , 1863</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Lyell ( , 1865))</ref>, or the Anniversary addresses of the President to the Geological Society, London (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">Woodward 1907;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Davies 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Then, in the first half of the 1860s, everything changed. This was the result of comprehensive regional studies by a new generation of Scottish geologists led by <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">Ramsay (1860)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Jamieson (1862</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Jamieson ( , 1863</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Jamieson ( , 1865) )</ref> and the Geikie brothers <ref type="bibr">(1863,</ref><ref type="bibr">1874)</ref> in what may be termed the 'Scottish glacial revival'. When they began their studies, they had assumed the glacial theory was false because that was the prevailing view. Their own work, systematic and wide-ranging, left them no choice but to conclude that Agassiz had been correct after all. From their time onwards, critics of the glacial theory became the exception rather than the majority.</p><p>One is tempted to think that consensus might be reached faster in the early 21st century than in the mid-19th century. This is doubtful. It is clear from the literature that Victorian geologists actually read each others' papers. No one could claim that this is true today.</p><p>Will consensus be achieved through some conceptual or technical breakthough? I doubt it: there have been several already and consensus is no closer than at the millenium. Was consensus on Pleistocene glaciation brought about by <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Jamieson's (1882)</ref> solution to the submergence problem, which was that each ice age was accompanied by submergence of the land, followed by slow reemergence after the ice disappeared? This problem (based on marine fossils within tills that are now elevated above sea level) was central to the interpretation of the Drift (e.g. Smith 1836). Agassiz had offered no explanation for it, there being no marine fossils in the Swiss glacial deposits. Geophysicists attributed ice-age submergence to the gravitational 'pull' of a gigantic polar ice cap on the adjacent seas (Adhe ´mar 1842; Croll 1875), a theory easily accommodated by those like Lyell and Murchison who believed that the drift came by way of iceberg-laden floods of Arctic origin. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">Shaler (1847)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Jamieson (1865)</ref> suggested, and later demonstrated with geological evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Jamieson 1882)</ref>, that submergence was caused by deflection of the lithosphere under the load of the ice sheet (glacioisostasy). However, Jamieson's (1882) theory of submergence came after broad acceptance of the glacial theory and cannot therefore have been its cause.</p><p>Consensus on the glacial theory came about because of the overwhelming weight of evidence of the same kind as that obtained in skeletal form by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agassiz (1842)</ref>. If consensus on the Snowball Earth hypothesis ultimately rests on the weight of evidence of the kind identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Kirschvink (1992)</ref> (palaeomagnetic evidence for low-latitude glaciation at sea level, syn-glacial sedimentary Fe 2 O 3 and MnO 2 ore formations, and global evidence of abrupt climate switching (cap carbonates)) a positive outcome appears more and more probable in the end because that evidence has only become stronger.</p><p>Must we also wait for two decades or more for consensus to emerge? Long delays between initial discussion of radical hypotheses and their broad acceptance is a general phenomenon in science (e.g. heliocentrism, biological evolution, continental drift, the big bang), so we must suppose there is a reason for the delays. The simplest one is that no consensus can emerge until after the original antagonists, tethered to hasty judgements, have passed from the scene. Given the lengthening of productive lifespans, we could be in for a long wait.</p><p>Whatever the final outcome concerning the state of the Cryogenian glacial ocean, it is apparent that a third climate state needs to be added to the two first recognized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Brooks (1926)</ref>: 'non-glacial' (no ice sheets), 'glacial' (polar to temperate ice sheets) and 'pan-glacial' (ice sheets at all latitudes).</p><p>As a comparative newcomer to Neoproterozoic glacial studies, I am grateful for reviews of a draft of this paper by M.
