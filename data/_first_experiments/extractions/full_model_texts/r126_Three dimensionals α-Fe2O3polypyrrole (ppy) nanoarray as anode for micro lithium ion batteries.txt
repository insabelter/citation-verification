Introduction
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries are now dominating the portable electronic market and showing promising applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) as well as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)  [1] . Microelectronic devices require rechargeable batteries with dimensions on the scale of 1-10 mm 3 , high energy capacity and high power density, which are difficult to achieve for conventional thin film batteries because of insufficient power and energy related to state-of-the art two dimensional configuration  [2] . Compared to 2D design, three dimensional (3D) nanostructured electrode architecture offers the opportunity to achieve large areal energy capacities without sacrificing power density in terms of small areas footprint, short ion diffusion length, enhancement in active materials loading along vertical direction  [1] . 3D nano-architectured electrodes based on various kinds of current collectors, such as copper nanopillar arrays  [3] , nickel nanorod arrays  [4] , gold nanoporous nanorods  [5] , porous polymer scaffold  [6]  and carbon nanotubes  [7]  have been demonstrated. Improvements in both energy and rate performance have been observed. The fabrication of 3D nanostructured electrode usually starts with preparation of self-supported nano-architectured current collector, and then followed with electrochemical/ chemical deposition of active materials. Template method is among the mostly used methods to prepare self-supported nano-architectured current collector  [8] . Although quite attractive, it is difficult for practical microbattery applications due to high production cost. Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore simple, cost-effective, self-supported electrode elaboration process compatible with the use of low cost and high performance materials, growing on noblemetal-free current collectors. a-Fe 2 O 3 has been demonstrated to be an attractive anode material because of its high theoretical capacity, low cost, low toxicity, and ease of fabrication  [9] . However, iron oxide always suffers from poor cyclability caused by drastic volume change during lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation process. Many approaches have been proposed to improve energy and rate capacity, such as fabricating Fe 2 O 3 nanomaterials into optimized nanostructure and shapes (nanotubes,  [10]  nanoflakes  [11]  or branched nanostructure  [12] ), or embed the active materials in a cushioning medium (carbon nanotubes  [13] , graphene  [14] , carbon fibers or conducting polymer  [9] ) to form hybrid nanostructure, etc. Several Fe 2 O 3 /carbon hybrid nanostructures have been designed and lead to improvement in charge/discharge rate. Inspired by these needs, we choose Iron foil as current collector and precursor for fabricating Fe 2 O 3 electrode. A simple, two-step process is developed, which includes coating of conducting polymer, polypyrrole (Ppy) additive layer on a-Fe 2 O 3 to fabricate a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy electrode.

Experimental Electrode synthesis
Three dimensional a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy electrode was fabricated via a simple, two-step approach which consists of growing of 3D a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes onto iron foil by direct thermal heating, and subsequent coating of Polypyrrole via chemical polymerization in neutral solution. Briefly, a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes were first grown onto an iron foil substrate uniformly by thermal heating of the iron foil (Aldrich, 0.1 mm thick, 99.9 + %) in air at 425 1C for 10 h. The Fe foil was polished by sand paper, prior to the growth, to form scratching, which acts as growth center of a-Fe 2 O 3 (Figures  S1  and S2 ). Then, a thin layer of Ppy was coated on the surface of a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes uniformly via chemical polymerization process with sodium p-toluenesulfonate (pTSNa) as the dopant, a mixture of DI water/ethanol (1:1, v/v) as solvent, and ammonium persulfate (APS, (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 ) as oxidant. The molar ratio of APS: pTSNa: monomer is 1.25:0.5:1. The polymerization was carried out at 0-5 1C for 15 min. The resulted a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy hybrid was then washed with DI water and dried overnight at 80 1C in a vacuum oven.

Material characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEM-6700F, 10.0 kV), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D-8 Avance), Raman system (Renishaw, 532 nm excitation laser) were used to characterize samples.

Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical performance was evaluated on CR2016 coin-type cells using the aforementioned self-supported a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composites as working electrode and lithium foil as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF 6 in a mixed organic solvent consisting of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1, v/v). Coil cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with both moisture and oxygen contents below 0.1 ppm. Galvanostatically charge/discharge tests were performed using a NEWARE cell tester over the potential range 0.01-3.0 V (vs. Li + /Li). Cyclic Voltammetry (0.01-3.0 V) tests and Electrochemical Impedance measurements (0.1-100000 Hz) were carried out using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Co. China).

Results and discussion
Three dimensional, self-supported a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composites were fabricated via a simple, two step process consisting of growing of 3D a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes onto iron foil and subsequent coating of Polypyrrole. As illustrated in Scheme 1, in the first step, a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes are grown onto iron foil uniformly by thermal heating of the polished iron foil in air at 425 1C for 10 h (Figure  S2 ). Secondly, a thin layer of polypyrrole is coated on the surface of a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes uniformly via chemical polymerization (Figures  S3  and S4 ). The conversion of a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes to a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composites is evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure  1b-e  & Figures  S3  and S4 ). An obvious color change can be viewed from low magnification SEM images in Figure  1(b) . The image of bare Iron foil on the left is bright while Fe 2 O 3 /Iron on the right is dark due to the growth of a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes. In Figure  1 (c), it is clear that micrometersized flakes with thickness around 10-30 nm are generally pointed perpendicular to the plane of Fe foil. The nanoflakes are separated by distance in the range of 60-300 nm. A thin Ppy film is uniformly deposited onto the surface a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes array, forming a conformal coating around each nanoflakes without any coalescence between them (Figure  2d ). The enlarge SEM image in Figure  2  clearly shows self-supported discontinuous nanoarchitectured a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composite. This unique 3D nanostructure processes a large active surface area and preserves the space between nanoflakes. It affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short ion diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space among neighboring nanoflakes for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/disintercalation when serve as anode for Li-ion battery  [3, 5]  Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) further confirm the presence of Ppy, a-Fe 2 O 3 and a small amount of Fe 3 O 4 in the nanoflakes. In Figure  2 (a) bare a-Fe 2 O 3 shows characteristic Raman peaks at 224, 290, 409 and 1300 cm À1 . After Ppy coating these a-Fe 2 O 3 peaks decrease in intensity, which is attributed to uniformly coating of polypyrrole onto the surface of a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes  [15] . The appearance of the strong peak at 1590 cm À1 , weak peaks at 982 cm À1 and 930 cm À1 , which are assigned to C =C backbone stretching and ring-in plane deformation of PPY, respectively, indicating the successful polymerization of polypyrrole  [16] . Similarly, the decrease in intensity of the typical X-ray diffraction peaks of a-Fe 2 O 3 is clearly observed in Figure  2    S5  and S6 ). Significant amount of carbon was detected only for a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy, homogenously dispersed throughout the whole area of a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy  [17] . To evaluate the electrochemical behavior, coin cells based on self-supported a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composites, without using binder and additional conductive additives, were assembled against a lithium metal counter electrode and subjected to galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling as well as cyclic voltammetry testing. Figure  3(a)  shows the representative discharge/charge voltage profiles of a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy hybrid electrodes at a current density 0.10 mA/cm 2 with a cutoff window of 0.01-3 V. A voltage plateaus is observed at 0.85 V during lithium intercalation, which is assigned to decomposition of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe with the formation of amorphous Li 2 O  [18] . The initial discharge capacity is 1.33 mA h/cm 2 . It gradually reduces to 0.82 and 0.78 mA h/ cm 2 for the second and fifth charge/discharge cycles, respectively. The irreversible capacity loss is obviously due to the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI)  [10, 14, 18] . The    respectively, while the intensity of both the peaks becomes stronger compared to bare a-Fe 2 O 3 electrode, indicating higher capacity and lower polarization due to the Ppy coating which can improve the conductivity of a-Fe 2 O 3 electrode. This was further verified by impedance measurements carried out before and after 200 charge/discharge cycles for both a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy and a-Fe 2 O 3 at current rate of 0.10 mA cm À2 (Figure  S8 ). The initial charge transfer resistance for a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy is 47.9 O, which is much smaller than that of bare a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes (65.3 O). Moreover, in contrast to the sharp resistance increase for bare a-Fe 2 O 3 (from 65.3 to 85.5, after 200 cycles), a-Fe 2 O 3 / Ppy composite electrode exhibited a smaller changes (from 47.9 to 61.0, 13.1 O). In order to confirm the feasibility of a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy nanoarchitectured electrode for microbattery application, cycle rate capability tests were conducted at various current rates ranging from 0.10 to 1.0 mA/cm 2 . As demonstrated in Figure  5 , the capacity progressively decreases with increasing rates. However the capacity remains fairly stable after 10 cycles and 0.32 mA h/cm 2 can be achieved at current of 1.0 mA/cm 2 , which is much better than those (0.03-0.2 mA h/cm 2 ) of many previous reports (such as 0.14 mA h/cm 2 at current density of 0.05 mA/cm 2 over 50 charge/discharge cycles for crystalline TiO 2 nanotube/ SnO nanowire  [19] , 0.2 mAh/cm 2 at current density of 0.025 mA/cm 2 over 45 charge/discharge cycles for TiO 2 nanotube/Fe 2 O 3 nanowire composite  [20] , 0.113 mA h/cm 2 at current density of 0.1 mA cm À2 after 50 charge/discharge cycles for coaxial SnO 2 /TiO 2 nanotube hybrids  [21] , 0.032 mA h/cm 2 at current density of 0.04 mA/cm 2 up to 75 charge/discharge cycles for Au/Polyanilne hybrid nanorods  [5] , and 0.1 mA h/cm 2 at current density of 0.006 mA/ cm 2 up to 100 charge/discharge cycles for carbon micro-net films  [22] ). Moreover, when the current rate decreases back to 0.1 mA/cm 2 , specific area capacity of around 0.46 mA h/ cm 2 can be restored after 60 cycles including deep cycling at high C-rate of 1.0 mA/cm 2 , indicating good stable rating capability.

Conclusions
In conclusion, three dimensional, self-supported a-Fe 2 O 3 / Ppy composite electrode with enhanced specific areal capacity and rate performance was successfully fabricated by a simple, low-cost, two-step process consisting of direct heating of iron foil in air and subsequent coating of conducting polymer Ppy on the a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes. By using a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy as the anode materials with iron foil as the current collector, the unique structure affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/deintercalation for Li-ion battery. A relatively high specific capacity of 0.42 mAh/cm 2 can be achieved at 0.1 mA/cm 2 even after 100 charge/ discharge cycles, with a plateau potential of 1 V and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. All these show the feasibility to use this unique 3D nanostructured hybrid composite for microbattery in both small and large scale applications.
