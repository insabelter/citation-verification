INTRODUCTION
After more than one billion years without robust evidence of glaciation, Cryogenian (ca. 850-635 Ma) strata record arguably the most extreme episodes of climate change in Earth's history. The widespread occurrence of lowlatitude glacial deposits on every paleocontinent, coupled with the unique geochemistry and sedimentology of cap carbonates  (Hoffman et al., 1998; Bao et al., 2008) , inspired the snowball Earth hypothesis  (Kirschvink, 1992) . However, the general paucity of radiometric age constraints from multiple paleocontinents for the onset and demise of Cryogenian glaciations (Sturtian ca. 717-660 Ma, and Marinoan ending ca. 635 Ma), as well as reports of putative pre-Sturtian glaciations  (Frimmel et al., 1996) , has fostered doubts about the synchronicity and global extent of these events (e.g.,  Allen and Etienne, 2008; Kendall et al., 2006) . In particular, an apparent disagreement between various geochronological constraints has fueled the idea Cryogenian glaciations were not particularly unique or extreme events; however, it remains unclear if these age differences represent true geological mismatches or the combination of analytical error and/ or poor cross-calibration between different geochronometers. Here we present four new Re-Os ages from strata that bound Cryogenian glacial deposits in northwest Canada, Zambia, and Mongolia. We then integrate these data with preexisting age constraints from multiple paleocontinents to produce an updated global Cryogenian chronology.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING
Black carbonaceous shales were sampled at four separate localities on three different Neoproterozoic paleocontinents (Fig.  1 ; Table  DR1  in the GSA Data Repository foot_0  ). The Callison Lake Formation of the Mount Harper Group is exposed in the Ogilvie Mountains of Yukon, Canada, and is composed of an ~400-m-thick succession of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic strata deposited in an episodically restricted marine basin  (Strauss et al., 2014; Fig. 1) . Current age constraints on the Mount Harper Group include an Re-Os age of 739.9 ± 6.1 Ma from the uppermost Callison Lake Formation and a U-Pb chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry age on zircon of 717.4 ± 0.1 Ma from the overlying Mount Harper Volcanics  (Macdonald et al., 2010a; Strauss et al., 2014) . To further refi ne the geological history of this succession, a black shale horizon was sampled from the lower Callison Lake Formation for Re-Os geochronology (Fig.  1 ; Fig.  DR1  in the Data Repository). The Katanga Supergroup of the Congo craton has been subdivided into the Roan, Nguba, and Kundelungu Groups and comprises a mixed carbonate and siliciclastic succession with two diamictite horizons (Fig.  1   ; Wendorff, 2003; Master et al., 2005) . In the Chambishi area of Zambia, the Mwashya subgroup of the Nguba Group records subtidal deposition in a restricted marginal marine setting and comprises an ~120-m-thick succession of black carbonaceous shale with a gradational to locally disconformable contact with the overlying glaciogenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate (Fig.  1 ;  Selley et al., 2005) . Age constraints on the Katanga Supergroup are limited to a maximum age for the onset of Roan Group sedimentation from a U-Pb sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) age of 883 ± 10 Ma  (Armstrong et al., 2005)  and ages of ca. 760 Ma from various volcanics within the Nguba Group  (Key et al., 2001) . Samples of carbonaceous black shale were collected from the Mwashya subgroup over a vertical interval of 6.49 m up to ~0.5 m below the Grand Conglomerate for Re-Os geochronology (MJCZ9 drill core;  Bodiselitsch et al., 2005) . The Tsagaan-Olom Group of the Zavkhan terrane in southwest Mongolia consists of as much as 2 km of carbonate-dominated strata that host two glacial deposits, the Maikhan-Uul and Khongor diamictites, which are considered to be the Sturtian and Marinoan equivalents, respectively (Fig.  1 ;  Macdonald et al., 2009) . Samples for Re-Os geochronology were sampled at the Taishir locality  (Macdonald et al., 2009) , 1.2 m above the contact with the Maikhan-Uul diamictite (Fig.  1 ) and within the Sturtian cap carbonate. The Cryogenian-Ediacaran-age Hay Creek and upper groups of the Windermere Supergroup are exposed in the Mackenzie Mountains, northwest Canada, and host Marinoan-age glacial deposits of the Stelfox Member of the Ice Brook Formation (Fig.  1 ;  Aitken, 1991; James et al., 2001) . A Marinoan age (ca. 635 Ma) for the Stelfox Member is supported by carbon isotope profi les and sedimentological characteristics of the Ravensthroat and Hayhook cap carbonate. Samples for Re-Os geochronology were collected from the Sheepbed Formation near Shale Lake  (Aitken, 1991) , 0.9 m above the contact with the underlying Hayhook limestone. The Sheepbed Formation consists of >700 m of siliciclastics deposited in a proximal to distal slope environment during a pronounced glacioeustatic transgression (Fig.  1 ;  Dalrymple and Narbonne, 1996) .

GEOCHRONOLOGY
Black shale from the lower part of the Callison Lake Formation of Yukon yields a Re-Os depositional age of 752.7 ± 5.5 Ma (all age uncertainties also include the uncertainty in the 187 Re decay constant, λ, 2σ, n = 5, mean square of weighted deviates, MSWD, of 0.30) with an initial 187 Os/ 188 Os (Os i ) composition of 0.33 ± 0.03 (Fig.  2A ). Regression of the Re-Os isotopic composition data from the Mwashya subgroup of Zambia yields a depositional age of 727.3 ± 4.9 Ma (2σ, n = 7, MSWD = 0.50) with an unradiogenic Os i value of 0.35 ± 0.03 (Fig.  2B ). The basal Taishir Formation of Mongolia yields a depositional Re-Os age of 659.0 ± 4.5 Ma (2σ, n = 6, MSWD = 0.67), with a moderately radiogenic Os i value of 0.60 ± 0.01 (Fig.  2C ). Regression of the isotopic composition data from samples of the Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada yields a Re-Os age of 632.3 ± 5.9 Ma (2σ, n = 5, MSWD = 0.58), with a highly radiogenic Os i value of 1.21 ± 0.04 (Fig.  2D ). These new Re-Os ages coupled with existing Re-Os and magmatic U-Pb age constraints are combined to produce a refi ned geochronological framework for the Cryogenian as summarized in Figure  3  (Table  DR2 ).

DISCUSSION
The existence of a pre-Sturtian, global Kaigas glaciation has been suggested from the apparent relationship between inferred glacial deposits and the following age constraints: a 741 ± 6 Ma Pb-Pb zircon evaporation age in the Gariep belt of the Kalahari craton  (Frimmel et al., 1996) ; a 740 ± 7 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age from near the base of the Bayisi diamictite on the Tarim craton  (Xu et al., 2009) ; and a 735 ± 5 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age from the Kundelungu Basin of the Congo craton  (Key et al., 2001) . However, previously published U-Pb and Re-Os ages from time-equivalent strata in Laurentia  (Karlstrom et al., 2000; Macdonald et al., 2010a; Strauss et al., 2014)  and the Re-Os age presented here from the Callison Lake Formation (Fig.  2A ) document nonglacial sedimentation from ca. 753 to 717 Ma on the western margin of Laurentia, arguing against low-latitude glaciation during this interval.  Macdonald et al. (2010b)  observed that the 741 ± 6 Ma Pb-Pb evaporation age from the Gariep belt  (Frimmel et al., 1996)  was sampled from volcanic rocks that are not in direct contact with glacial deposits and that conglomerate of the Kaigas Formation was previously miscorrelated with glacigenic strata of the Numees   Formation. Therefore, this age only provides a maximum age constraint on the Sturtian-age Numees Formation. Similarly, no defi nitive evidence for glacial sedimentation has been demonstrated in the Bayisi diamictite of the Tarim block, and the 740 ± 7 Ma U-Pb age of  Xu et al. (2009)  is potentially undermined by the fact that the analysis includes many zircon grains that are possibly inherited from underlying ca. 750 Ma volcanic rocks. Consequently, the 735 ± 5 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age on the Luatama breccia of the Congo craton  (Key et al., 2001)  has remained a fi nal holdout for the putative ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. However, this U-Pb age is compromised not only by the inclusion of grains that were possibly inherited from the underlying ca. 765 Ma mafi c volcanic rocks of the lowermost Mwashya subgroup  (Key et al., 2001) , but also by the poorly constrained nature of the contact between the Luatama breccia and the glacial deposits  (Selley et al., 2005) . Our new 727.3 ± 4.9 Ma Re-Os age from directly below the Grand Conglomerate is consistent with a Sturtian age for the oldest Cryogenian glacial deposits on the Congo craton (Figs.  2B  and 3 ). The Re-Os age of 752.7 ± 5.5 Ma for the basal Callison Lake Formation provides a new depositional age constraint for the lower portion of this unit and expands the range of vase-shaped microfossil occurrences in northwest Canada  (Strauss et al., 2014) . It is interesting that the Os i value from this basin at the time of deposition was markedly unradiogenic (Os i = 0.33), in contrast to the Os i value presented for the upper Callison Lake Formation at 739.9 ± 6.1 Ma (Os i = 0.60;  Strauss et al., 2014)  and modern-day seawater (Os i = 1.06; Peucker-Ehrenbrink and Ravizza, 2012). This Os i value suggests that the dominant source of Os entering this basin was either derived from the localized weathering of juvenile crustal material (e.g., basalt) or sourced from hydrothermal inputs. Similarly, the unradiogenic Os i value of 0.35 for the Mwashya subgroup is suggestive of a signifi cant infl ux of unradio genic Os into this basin. These pre-Sturtian Os i values, together with earlier work from northwest Canada  (Rooney et al., 2014) , lend further support to the so-called fi re and ice mechanism of snowball Earth initiation, whereby the weathering of voluminous unradiogenic basalts at low latitudes would have enhanced CO 2 drawdown, resulting in a climate sensitive enough to enter a global glaciation  (Goddéris et al., 2003) . The Re-Os age of 659.0 ± 4.5 Ma for the Taishir Formation constrains the termination of the Sturtian-age Maikhan-Uul glaciation in Mongolia. This age is identical, within uncertainty, to Re-Os and U-Pb zircon age constraints for post-Sturtian horizons from northwest Canada, China, and Australia, and confi rms a long duration (>55 m.y.) for the Sturtian glacial epoch  (Fig. 3; Zhou et al., 2004; Kendall et al., 2006; Macdonald et al., 2010a; Lan et al., 2014; Rooney et al., 2014) . The Os i value of 0.60 is moderately unradiogenic, in contrast to modernday seawater, and is similar to values reported near the base of the post-glacial Twitya Formation in northwest Canada (0.54 versus 0.60). An existing Re-Os date of 607.8 ± 4.7 Ma from shale of the Windermere Supergroup, Canada, was suggested to represent a termination age for the Marinoan glaciation  (Kendall et al., 2004) . However, this Re-Os age is from an isolated outcrop that is not in direct contact with the underlying Marinoan-age glacial deposits or cap carbonate  (Kendall et al., 2004) . Our new Re-Os age of 632.3 ± 5.9 Ma from 0.9 m above the distinctive Ravensthroat-Hayhook cap carbonate is within uncertainty of multiple ca. 635 Ma U-Pb zircon ages on the deglaciation of the Marinoan snowball Earth event worldwide  (Figs. 2D and 3; Hoffmann et al., 2004; Condon et al., 2005; Calver et al., 2013 .

CONCLUSION
The four Re-Os ages presented herein help refi ne our current Neoproterozoic chronology. These data refute the evidence for an earlier global Kaigas glaciation and suggest instead that the initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch ca. 717 Ma marked the fi rst unambiguous glacial event in more than a billion years. Together with existing geochronological data, the new Re-Os ages constrain the onset and demise of the long-lasting (717-660 Ma) Sturtian glacial epoch and further bolster correlations for the end-Cryogenian Marinoan glaciation ca. 635 Ma (Fig.  3 ). The long duration (>55 m.y.) of the Sturtian glacial epoch implies a relatively short Cryogenian nonglacial interlude (<25 m.y.), consistent with a repeated trigger for glaciation related to the tectonic background conditions that drive weathering and the consumption of CO 2 on 1-10 m.y. time scales  (Mills et al., 2011) . This updated Neoproterozoic chronology provides new constraints to test and refi ne climate models of a long-duration glacial epoch and the nature of a relatively short nonglacial interlude. The Os i data presented here confi rm enhanced weathering of juvenile crustal material prior to the onset of the Sturtian glacial epoch, consistent with a basalt weathering trigger for initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch (e.g.,  Goddéris et al., 2003; Rooney et al., 2014) . These ages confi rm the central prediction of the snowball Earth hypothesis of long-lived (~10 m.y.) glaciation with globally synchronous deglaciation.
