Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) crystals derived from inorganic layered compounds offer a unique platform to explore fundamental condensed matter phenomena  1  . Recently, tremendous interest has focused on 2D crystals of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) and other members of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) due to their intriguing electrical and optical properties  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  . A single monolayer of MoS 2 is a direct gap semiconductor with high in-plane carrier mobility and excellent gate coupling for electrostatic control of charge carrier density  10, 11, 14  . Finite band gap and remarkable device performance make MoS 2 a complementary 2D material to graphene in nanoelectronics and photonics  11, 15  . Further, sizable spin-orbit interaction along with broken inversion symmetry in monolayer MoS 2 allows optical access to valley degrees of freedom, demonstrating potential in novel spintronic and valleytronic devices  4, 9, 16, 17  . Tungsten-based LTMDs such as WS 2 and WSe 2 are isoelectronic to MoS 2 and exhibit a similar set of intriguing properties in 2D crystal form  7, 11, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  . Their monolayer consists of an X-M-X sandwich  28  (M and X denote transition metal and chalcogen atoms, respectively) with trigonal prismatic coordination as in MoS 2 . Exfoliation of WS 2 and WSe 2 to mono-to few-layer thick sheets has been recently demonstrated by many groups  7, 18, 19, 21, 25, 26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33]  . This has led to observation of remarkable field-modulated transport with large in-plane mobility  11, 19  , indirect-to-direct band gap transition upon isolation of single layers  7, 21, 22, 32  , robust valley polarization  25  , second harmonic generation  7  , and tightly bound trions  25  . Spin-orbit interaction in these materials is substantially larger  [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  compared to that in MoS 2 thus offering a robust platform to study spin and valley physics. While confinement effects on the electronic and excitonic dispersion relation in atomically thin sheets of tungsten dichalcogenides has been extensively studied to date  21, 34, [39] [40] [41]  . On the other hand, little has been understood about the phonon behaviors in these 2D crystals. Lee et al.  42  recently reported that phonon frequency of atomically thin MoS 2 flakes exhibits unique thickness dependence where two characteristic Raman active modes 1g A and 1 2 g E exhibit opposite trends with thickness. Specifically, the 1g A mode, which involves the out-of-plane displacement of S atoms, is found to stiffen with increasing number of layers. In contrast, the 1 2 g E mode, which involves the in-plane displacement of Mo and S atoms, exhibits softening with flake thickness. Further studies  43  have shown that the shift in the 1g A mode can be explained by the interlayer interaction of S atoms in the neighboring planes，while the unexpected trend of the , there have been conflicting reports on the thickness dependence of phonon modes in WS 2 and WSe 2 sheets in mono-to few-layer regime.  7, 22, 26, 31, 32, 46, 47  For WSe 2 , this is partly attributed to the lack of consensus on the assignment of 1g A mode  7, 31, 47  . Of particular interest is the discrepancy between the experimental with the theoretical results where latter suggest that 1g A and 1 2 g E are degenerate in WSe 2 .  47  Further, behavior of multiphonon modes which contain rich information on the electronic and phonon dispersion relation  46  are largely unexplored. A detailed study of the phonon properties needs to be conducted in order to achieve valuable insight into phonon confinement effects in these intriguing 2D materials. Here, we report detailed studies on the Raman spectra of mechanically exfoliated mono-and few-layer WS 2 and WSe 2 flakes. With the use of polarized spectroscopy, we demonstrate that for both materials the 1g A and 1 2 g E modes exhibit opposite shift with increasing number of layers indicating the effects of both short and long range interactions. We find that these phonon modes are degenerate in monolayer WSe 2 as predicted by theory  47  but the degeneracy is lifted in multilayers. We further discuss excitonic resonance Raman spectra for WS 2 and WSe 2 where a series of multiphonon bands are observed. We demonstrate that some of these features contain unique fingerprints of monolayer flakes.

Results and Discussion
Figure  1a  shows the optical contrast or differential reflectance spectra of 3L WS 2 and WSe 2 flakes. The optical contrast is defined as ( S Q R  -Q R )/ Q R where S Q R  and Q R are the reflected light intensities from the quartz substrate with and without samples, respectively  2, 48  . This quantity is proportional to absorbance for ultrathin samples and its spectral response can be interpreted as absorption spectrum  2, 21, 48  . Characteristic excitonic absorption peaks A and B are observed along with a higher energy density of states peak C and split exciton peaks A' and B'. The A and B excitonic absorption peaks arise from optical transitions involving spin-orbit split valence band and degenerate conduction band at the K point of the Brillouin zone  34, 49  . In this study, we investigate Raman scattering with three excitation wavelengths (472, 532, and 633 nm). The 532 nm excitation is in resonance with the B exciton peak of WS 2 and A' exciton peak of WSe 2 . On the other hand, 473 nm excitation is roughly in resonance with the interband transition peak C for WS 2 and interband absorption continuum for WSe 2 . The 633 nm excitation is in resonance with the A excitonic absorption for WS 2 and interband absorption but close to the B excitonic absorption for WSe 2 . Raman features of both WS 2 and WSe 2 strongly depend on the excitation conditions due to energy dependent Raman cross section of the phonons (See Supporting Information for details). The absorption peaks shift slightly with flake thickness  21  but the resonance conditions remain largely unaltered. The crystal structure of 2H-WX 2 belongs to 4 6h D point group. There are 18 lattice dynamical modes at the center of the Brillouin zone (  point)  [50] [51] [52] [53] [54]  . The irreducible representations of zone center phonons are as follows  50, 51, 54  : 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 g u u g g u u g A A B B E E E E          The atomic displacement of the four Raman active modes 1g A , 1g E , 1 2g E and 2 2g E is shown in Figure 1b. The 1g A mode is an out-of-plane vibration involving only the chalcogen atoms while the 1 2 g E mode involves in-plane displacement of transition metal and chalcogen atoms  50, 51  . The 2 2g E mode is shear mode corresponding to the vibration of two rigid layers against each other and appears at very low frequencies (< 50 cm -1 )  26, 45, 50, 51, 53, [55] [56] [57] [58]  . The 1g E mode, which is an in-plane vibration of only the chalcogen atoms, is forbidden in the back-scattering Raman configuration  50, 51  . Monolayer WX 2 belongs to 3h D point group and has 9 modes at the Brillouin zone center.  43  The rigid layer shear mode E peaks that are clearly separated and of similar intensity (Figure  1c ). In contrast, only one prominent peak can be clearly seen in bulk WSe 2 spectrum in the frequency region where we expect 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks  57  (See Supporting Information). In 633 nm excitation condition, however, multiple peaks are evident in this region (Figure  1d ). There have been inconsistent reports on the assignment of these peaks  7, 31, 32, 47  . We demonstrate below that two peaks found at 248 and 250 cm -1 are 1 2 g

E and 1g
A peaks in agreement with the previous study by Mead and Irwin  57  . In polarized back-scattering Raman spectroscopy, 1g A mode is allowed in parallel polarization ( ( ) Z XX Z ) but forbidden in cross polarization ( ( ) Z XY Z ) conditions  45  .

Thus 1g
A mode can be identified by observing Raman spectra in the two polarization conditions. Figure  2a  shows the parallel and cross polarized Raman spectra of 1 to 5L and bulk WS 2 flakes obtained with 473 nm excitation. The disappearance of the peak at ~ 420 cm -1 in cross polarization confirms that it is a 1g A mode. The peak at around ~ 356 cm -1 with no polarization dependence is a 1 2 g E mode. The peak positions agree well with the previous reports  53, 54  . As shown in Figure  2 , the 1g A phonon stiffens and 1 2 g E phonon softens with increasing flake thickness similar to the case of MoS 2  42  and as predicted by recent theoretical studies  43  . The difference in the frequency of these peaks is 60 and 65 cm -1 for monolayer and bulk samples, respectively (Figure  2b ). The intensity ratios ( 1g A / 1 2 g E ) show a similar trend as seen in MoS 2 . The FWHM is found to consistently decrease with increasing number of layers (Figure  2c ). Raman spectra of WSe 2 flakes measured in two polarization configurations and with 633 nm excitation are shown in Figure  3a . In contrast to the case in WS 2 , the parallel polarization spectra of WSe 2 flakes exhibit one prominent peak with a small shoulder in the frequency region where 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks are expected to be observed  57  . The main peak upshifts from 249.5 to 251 cm -1 with increasing flake thickness from monolayer to bulk. In cross polarized spectra, a single peak is observed in this frequency region. This peak is found to downshift with increasing flake thickness. The peak intensity is normalized in Figure  3a  to show this trend. The opposite thickness dependence and polarization dependence indicates that they are indeed 1g A and 1 2 g E modes. The peak at 257 cm -1 did not show consistent polarization dependence, as shown in the Figure  S2  of the Supporting Information. This peak was reported to be the 1g A phonon by some groups  7, 31, 47  . As shown in Figure1 and Figure  S2 , this peak is very broad, which is uncharacteristic for a first order Raman peak, and shows only weak dependence on the polarization configuration. It is assigned to the 2LA(M) phonon here according the theoritical calculation  59  . Similar to MoS 2 and WS 2 , the 1g A ( 1 2 g E ) phonon of WSe 2 stiffens (softens) with increase in flake thickness (Figure  3b ). The key difference is that the two modes become virtually degenerate in the single layer limit. We note that in 473 nm excitation condition, only a single peak appears in the unpolarized and parallel polarized spectra due to relatively weak   3c ). A and ∆ 1 2 g E ) is also highly dependent on the material (Figure  4b ). Stiffening and softening of the modes are most prominently observed in MoS 2 where 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks shift by 4 and 2 cm -1 , respectively.  42  The shift becomes less pronounced with "heavier" MX 2 with one exception of  1  2 g E mode of MoSe 2 which has been reported to exhibit comparatively large shift (~ 3.6 cm -1 )  18  . Due to the heavy atoms, WSe 2 shows the smallest thickness dependent shift (~ 1.3 cm -1 ) for the two modes. The small thickness dependence of the 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks in WS 2 and WSe 2 imply that they are not ideal fingerprints for identifying the number of layers. In the following, we discuss thickness dependence of other phonons that are observed in excitonic resonance conditions. We focus the following discussions on 532 nm resonance. Details of results obtained with 633 nm excitation are presented in the Supporting Information. A modes. Detailed assignments of multiphonon bands according to recently calculated phonon dispersion curves  43, 59  are summarized in Table  S1  of the Supporting Information. The most prominent resonance feature emerges near the 1 2g E peak for both WS 2 and WSe 2 . This peak, labeled as 2LA(M), is a second-order Raman mode due to LA phonons at the M point in the Brillouin zone  43, 54  . We found that the 2LA(M) mode shows distinct downshift of 5 cm -1 with increasing flake thickness from monolayer to trilayer for WSe 2 (See Supporting Information for details). In contrast, the same mode in WS 2 showed no obvious trend. The first-order phonon LA(M) in both WS 2 and WSe 2 is widely involved in the overtone and combination mode of other zone edge phonons, similar to the case of MoS 2 44, 60 . We observed similar multiphonon bands and 2LA(M) features with 633 nm excitation, which is in resonance with A and B exciton absorption for WS 2 and WSe 2 , respectively (See Supporting Information for details). These results indicate that the enhancement of the total Raman cross section at excitonic resonance in which excitons serve as the intermediate state is stronger compared to that of interband resonance. The strong enhancement at excitonic resonance is attributed to the characteristics of excitons in layered materials such as large binding energy, enhanced oscillator strength, and small damping constant  28, 34, [61] [62] [63]  . It should be noted that resonance Raman features are also seen with 473 nm excitation but to a lesser degree (See Supporting Information for details). Figure  5b  highlights that a peak at ~ 310 cm -1 , which is consistently observed for multilayer flakes of WS 2 , is absent in monolayers. The origin of this mode is not clear, however, its absence in monolayers suggests that it may be related to rigid layer shear. Relatively large frequency of this peak suggests that it is a combination of low-frequency modes  26, 45  with another phonon mode. Figure  6b  shows that similar behavior is observed in a peak located around 308 cm -1 for WSe 2 . This peak is absent in monolayers and shows clear softening with increasing thickness. Thus, it is possibly a combination mode of a shear and 

Methods
Bulk crystals of 2H-WS 2 and 2H-WSe 2 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT). Bulk crystals of 2H-WS 2 and 2H-WSe 2 crystals were mechanically exfoliated on to quartz substrates and used for subsequent spectroscopic characterization. The number of layers in the flakes was confirmed by optical contrast and atomic force microscope (AFM)  21  . The optical contrast was measured using a tungsten-halogen lamp coupled to a Raman spectrometer. Raman spectra were acquired in ambient conditions using 473, 532 and 633 nm laser excitations. The laser power on the sample during Raman measurement was kept below 150 μW in order to avoid sample damage and excessive heating. A 2400 grooves/mm grating was used to achieve spectral resolution of below 1 cm -1 . The silicon Raman mode at 520 cm -1 was used for the calibration prior to measurements.    E (1L)), respectively. The data for MoS 2 and MoSe 2 are obtained from Ref [42] and Ref [18], respectively.
