Systematic Reviews on Rehabilitation Interventions
I was impressed with the breadth of Tate's lecture  1  on the state of rehabilitation research, which provided evidence of encouraging progress in this area. However, the progress on the systematic reviewing of the rehabilitation interventions is sadly rather more modest than she has reported.  1  Specifically, her reported number of 5075 Cochrane reviews on rehabilitation for just 7 selected diagnostic groups in July 2005 exceeds the total of 2608 completed reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2006). It may well be that her search results included "hits" from several of the other 7 databases also contained in the Cochrane Library. A search purely on rehabilitation, as probably used by Tate, yields 334 completed Cochrane reviews and 106 protocols for Cochrane reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2006). This simple search strategy will, however, miss several relevant reviews and include other nonrehabilitation reviews. Despite the far smaller number of Cochrane reviews, Cochrane and other systematic reviews of rehabilitation are still a growth area in terms of "number, scope, and quality" as concluded by Tate. By virtue of their being updated on a regular basis, Cochrane reviews are indeed particularly "valuable tools on which to continue to build a strong theoretical body of knowledge."  1(p164)  However, there is still considerably more to be done and, in particular, I urge rehabilitation specialists to contribute actively to this endeavor.
