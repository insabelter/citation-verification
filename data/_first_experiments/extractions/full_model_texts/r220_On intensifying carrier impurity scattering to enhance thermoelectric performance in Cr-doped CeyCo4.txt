[ 10 ]  Strategies such as carrier concentration engineering  [ 2, 11 ]  and band structure modifi cation  [ 12 ]  have been identifi ed to be effective for PF and ZT enhancements. Besides being pertinent to the electronic band structure and the Fermi level, electrical transport properties are also closely related to the carrier scattering processes, including phonon scattering, impurity scattering, energy barrier scattering, etc.  [13] [14] [15]  Above room temperature, lattice vibrations generally dominate the carrier scattering for most of the thermoelectric materials, e.g., Bi 2 Te 3 [ 16 ] or PbTe.  [ 17 ]  Since almost all of the thermoelectric materials are heavily doped semiconductors, impurity scattering, especially ionized impurity scattering, could play an important role in carrier transport at T > 300 K, as evident in Ni-doped  [ 18, 19 ]  or Te-doped  [ 20 ]  CoSb 3 , or transition metalsubstituted clathrates.  [ 21 ]  The carrier scattering probability by ionized impurity is inversely proportional to ε 3/2 ( ε : carrier energy) or v 3 ( v : drift velocity),  [ 22, 23 ]  therefore the low energy carriers would experience more scattering and be fi ltered out by the charged impurities. This energy fi ltering effect could enhance the Seebeck coeffi cient, analogous to the effect of energy barriers.  [ 3, 15 ]  Theoretically this offers the possibility to optimize PF through balancing the mobility decrease and the Seebeck coeffi cient enhancement, and the optimal scattering parameter should depend on the Fermi level and other material-specifi c para meters.  [ 14, 18, 24 ]  This effect is analogue to the prediction by Ioffe  [ 25 ]  about a half century ago, however, rather precise control of the impurity scattering strength is required to realize power factor and ZT improvements in heavily doped semiconductors.  [ 26 ]  Indeed, Ioffe's initial experimental work about PbTe gave no enhancement in power factor or ZT ,  [ 25 ]  and subsequently numerical calculations done by Ure  [ 24 ]  predicted no more than 10% enhancement in ZT by introducing ionized impurities. These may have contributed to the dormancy of studying the infl uence of ionized impurity scattering on thermoelectrics, and to the best of our knowledge only limited experimental results have been reported.  [ 18, 27 ]  The strength of ionized impurity scattering depends not only on the effective concentration of impurities but also on

On Intensifying Carrier Impurity Scattering to Enhance Thermoelectric Performance in Cr-Doped Ce y Co 4 Sb 12
Shanyu Wang , Jiong Yang , Lihua Wu , Ping Wei , Wenqing Zhang , * and Jihui Yang * The benefi cial effect of impurity scattering on thermoelectric properties has long been disregarded even though possible improvements in power factor have been suggested by Ioffe more than a half century ago. Here it is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that proper intensifi cation of ionized impurity scattering to charge carriers can benefi t the thermoelectric fi gure of merit ( ZT ) by increasing the Seebeck coeffi cient and decreasing the electronic thermal conductivity. The optimal strength of ionized impurity scattering for maximum ZT depends on the Fermi level and the density of states effective mass. Cr-doping in Ce y Co 4 Sb 12 progressively increases the strength of ionized impurity scattering, and signifi cantly improves the Seebeck coeffi cient, resulting in high power factors of 45 µW cm -1 K -2 with relatively low electrical conductivity. This effect, combined with the increased Ce-fi lling fraction and thus decreased lattice thermal conductivity by charge compensation of Cr-dopant, gives rise to a maximum ZT of 1.3 at 800 K and a large average ZT of 1.1 between 500 and 850 K, ≈30% and ≈20% enhancements as compared with those of Cr-free sample, respectively. Furthermore, this study also reveals that carrier scattering parameter can be another fundamental degree of freedom to optimize electrical properties and improve thermal-toelectricity conversion effi ciencies of thermoelectric materials.

Introduction
Thermoelectric technology is currently limited to niche applications, and this is primarily due to the low performance of the state-of-the-art materials.  [ 1, 2 ]  The thermoelectric performance of a material is quantifi ed by a dimensionless fi gure of merit, ZT = α 2 σT / κ , where α , σ , κ , and T are the Seebeck coeffi cient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and the absolute temperature in Kevin, respectively. Strengthening phonon scattering to lower lattice thermal conductivity κ L through nanostructures,  [ 3, 4 ]  lattice anharmonicity,  [ 5 ]  alloying,  [ 6, 7 ]  atomic rattling,  [ 8 ]  point defect engineering,  [ 9 ]  etc., has led to fruitful the carrier concentration and some other material-specifi c para meters, such as the dielectric constant K , density of states effective mass m d *. According to Brooks' and Herring's derivations,  [ 23, 28 ]  the carrier relaxation time of ionized impurity scattering under the Born approximation and a Coulombic potential screening effect is expressed as τ ε π ε π ( ) = + - + ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ = ′ - 2 ln(1 ) 1 , 2 I 2 d * 1 2 3 2 4 I 1 d * B 2 2 K m e N b b b b Km k T e n ( 1 ) where e , N I , k B , and h ¯ are the elementary charge, effective impurity density, the Boltzmann constant, and the reduced Planck constant, respectively. n ′ is related to the carrier concentration n and charge compensation (when both acceptors and donors are present), and equal to n if a single type of impurity is present (such as the donors in an n-type semiconductor). It is obvious that the carrier screening effect (proportional to K ) and charge compensation ( b ) both infl uence τ I signifi cantly. For materials with large K values, such as PbTe ( K ~ 1000), the ionized impurity scattering seldom plays an important role in carrier transport.  [ 15, 17 ]  Furthermore, it can be noted that the last term in the bracket of Equation (  1 ) , which can be simplifi ed as [ln(1 + b ) -1] -1 when b >> 1 (the Born approximation  [ 29 ]  ), is a function of the degree of charge compensation which depends on the concentrations of donors, acceptors, and charge carriers. Although ionized impurity scattering has been intensively studied,  [ 14, 18, 22, 23, [29] [30] [31]  its effect on the electrical properties in the context of thermoelectricity has seldom been emphasized or quantitatively investigated.  [ 24, 25 ]  To the best of our knowledge, the original prediction by Ioffe  [ 25 ]  has seldom been explicitly demonstrated experimentally. In the present study, by assuming the carrier transport being dominated by a mixed acoustic phonon and ionized impurity scatterings, we numerically illustrate that an increase in the strength of ionized impurity scattering could moderately improve the power factor by balancing the enhancement in Seebeck coeffi cient and the reduction of mobility, and thus appreciably enhance ZT for a given lattice thermal conductivity. This concept is further experimentally validated in Cr-doped Ce y Co 4 Sb 12 samples prepared by a traditional melting-annealing-sintering technique. Here Cr-doping at the Co sites has two effects: (i) adjusting the strength of ionized impurity scattering through increasing impurity concentration, and (ii) increasing Ce fi lling fraction limit (FFL) by charge compensation. The low FFL of Ce (≈0.1) in CoSb 3 is insuffi cient to optimize the electrical properties (the optimal doping concentration is ≈0.5 e per Co 4 Sb 12 , corresponding to y of ≈0.17 for Ce) or reduce κ L .  [ 32, 33 ]  The charge compensation provided by Cr at the Co sites or other acceptors (Fe, Mn at the Co sites  [ 33, 34 ]  or Sn, Ge at the Sb sites  [ 35, 36 ]  is an effective approach to adjust carrier concentration and reduce κ L by increasing FFL, primarily due to the strong fi ller-defect interaction which stabilizes the fi llers.  [ 33, 36 ]  More importantly, enhanced Seebeck coeffi cients owing to the intensifi ed impurity scattering render high power factors over a wide temperature range. This high average power factor coupled with the decreased κ L gives rise to a maximum ZT of ≈1.3 and a large average ZT of 0.9 between 300 and 850 K, which are ≈30% and ≈20% improvement over those of Cr-free sample, respectively.

Results and Discussion


Cr Charge Compensation and Its Effects on Electrical
Properties at 300 K Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) shown in Figure  S1  (Supporting Information) indicates that the main phase is the cubic skutterudite (space group Im -3), and all samples contain minor Sb phase. The backscattered images shown in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information), however, feature minute microsize Ce-rich precipitates (CeSb or CeSb 2 , <1 vol%) due to the low FFL of Ce in CoSb 3 (≈0.1). The amount of Ce-rich precipitates decreases with increasing Cr content owing to the charge compensation effect of Cr at the Co sites, which increases the Ce fi lling fraction as indicated by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) derived Ce content in Table  1  (the EDX-derived Ce content increases gradually from 0.09 to 0.14). Concurrently, electron concentration shown in Table  1  increases gradually with increasing Cr-content, mainly because of the increase in the Ce fi lling fraction that overcompensates the substitutional acceptor Cr Co in CoSb 3 . The "overcompensation" phenomena can also be found in Fe-doped and Mn-doped Ce-fi lled skutterudites,  [ 33, 34 ]  as well as other n-type fi lled skutterudites with other p-type acceptors Table  1 . The EDX-derived Ce content, density (ρ), lattice parameters (a 0 ), carrier concentrations (n H ), Hall mobilities (µ H ), Seebeck coeffi cient (α), reduced Fermi energy (η), effective mass (m d */m 0 ), and lattice thermal conductivity (κ L ) at 300 K for Ce y Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 (x = 0-0.1; y = 0.2, 0.25) compounds.

Samples
Ce content ρ [g cm  -3  ] (defects).  [ 35, 36 ]  The origin of these results is the fi ller-defect interaction which further stabilizes the fi llers and therefore enhances the FFL, as pointed out in ref.  [ 37 ]  . Figure  1  a shows the interaction energy between Ce and transition metal defects, versus the defect charge states. The interaction energy is obtained by the energy differences between the confi gurations with the dopant at the nearest site to Ce and at a nonnearest site. The computational details can be found in ref.  [ 37 ]  . Cr Co , Mn Co , and Fe Co all have benefi cial interaction energies with the fi llers in Co 4 Sb 12 , which well accounts for the general overcompensation phenomenon. The interaction energy roughly increases linearly with the defect charge state as shown in Figure  1  a, implying that the interaction is Coulombic in nature. In fact, due to the attraction between Ce and Cr Co , their nearest distance is ≈3.65 Å, slightly shorter than that of Ce-Co (3.88 Å). The interaction energy of the Ce-Cr Co (0.19 eV) is close to that of the Ce-Ga Sb (0.21 eV),  [ 37 ]  even though the Co site is much further away than the nearest Sb site. This is presumably due to the high charge state of the Cr Co , which signifi cantly infl uences the transport properties of the host as discussed below. It is worthwhile noting that the starting stoichiometry particularly that of Sb or high annealing temperature may signifi cantly infl uence the FFL of Ce in CoSb 3 , as recently suggested by Tang et al.,  [ 38 ]  but these are not applicable in this study as all samples are stoichiometric in Co and Sb and the same annealing temperature was used for each sample. a 0 [Å] n H [10 20 cm -3 ] µ H [cm 2 V -1 s -1 ] α [µV K -1 ] η m d */m 0 κ L [W m -1 K -1 ] Ce 0. Besides increasing the Ce-fi lling fraction and electron concentration, Cr-doping also signifi cantly infl uences carrier transport properties, such as the scattering mechanism, etc. Electron mobility decreases rapidly with increasing carrier concentration, especially for the x = 0.1 samples. Figure  1 b  shows mobility versus carrier concentration for all Ce y Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 samples, which are obviously lower than the general trend of fi lled CoSb 3 .  [ 32 ]  The very low mobilities for the Cr-doped samples indicate either intensifi ed phonon scattering or the introduction of additional scattering mechanisms, e.g., impurity scattering. The αn plot of Cr-doped samples does not follow the general trend of fi lled CoSb 3 ,  [ 39 ]  especially for the x = 0.1 samples, as shown in Figure  1     [ 32 ] . c) Seebeck coeffi cient as a function of carrier concentration at 300 K for Ce y Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 . The experimental data of Fe-,  [ 33, 34 ]  Mn-,  [ 33 ]  and Te-doped  [ 40 ]  CoSb 3 are also shown in (b) and (c). The diamond points and solid line are for fi lled CoSb 3 taken from ref. [ 39 ] , and the dotted and Similar mobility reduction and Seebeck coeffi cient enhancement can be found for Fe-doped or Te-doped samples,  [ 33, 34, 40 ]  as shown in Figure  1 b, c . In addition, the fi rst principles density of states (DOS) for Ce 0.125 Co 3.875 Cr 0.125 Sb 12 and Ce 0.125 Co 4 Sb 12 were calculated, as shown in Figure  1 d . Cr atom introduces localized d states at the top of the valence band, with 0.1 eV energy splitting under spin polarization. These localized states are 0.2 eV higher than those in Fe-based p-type skutterudites  [ 41 ]  due to the lessd -electron nature of Cr. In the conduction band, Cr d states are much more dispersive due to the strong dp hybridization with the Sb atoms, and have negligible contribu-tions to the total DOS. As shown in Figure  1 d , the total DOS for samples with or without Cr are almost identical in the energy window of 0-0.15 eV above the conduction band bottom, which is the typical range for n-type fi lled skutterudites.  [ 42 ]  According to the above analyses, it can be concluded that the Seebeck coeffi cient enhancement should be mainly originated from the variation of electron scattering mechanism, such as the introduction of impurity scattering which increases the average electron entropy (kinetic energy)  [ 7 ]  or spin-electron scattering associated with the unpaired electrons of Cr ions. Signifi cant Seebeck coeffi cient improvement has indeed been observed previously by varying the carrier scattering mechanism in PbTe  [ 13, 15 ]  and Sb 2 Te 3 .  [ 43 ]  

Numerical Modeling of the Effect of Ionized Impurity Scattering on the Electrical Properties
To explore the variation of scattering parameter and its effects on the electrical transport properties, high temperature Hall coeffi cient R H (300-700 K) was measured, as shown in Figure  2  a. R H decreases rapidly with increasing temperature which has been reported for lots of fi lled skutterudites.  [ 44 ]  The rapid decrease in R H , starting at very low temperatures (≈10 K), is distinct from normal degenerate semiconductors, and the origin of this phenomenon is unclear.  [ 14 ]  The bipolar conduction, only appeared at elevated temperatures (>700 K) as evident for the temperature dependent Seebeck coeffi cient and lattice thermal conductivity shown below, should be irrelevant for the anomalous temperature dependence of Hall coeffi cient in present study (300-700 K). Figure  2 b  shows the temperature dependence of mobility, and the Cr-free samples show temperature exponents γ of ≈-1.5 around 300 K, indicative of acoustic phonon scattering of the carriers. With increasing Cr content, however, γ around 300 K varies gradually to ≈-0.9 for the x = 0.1 samples, as shown in Figure  2 c . This indicates a gradual increase in strength of the ionized impurity scattering, which can be further attributed to the substitutional Cr ions at the Co sites, similar to the effect of Ni-doping.  [ 18, 19 ]  Yang et al. had studied the valence state of Cr in CoSb 3 and concluded that Cr takes the Cr 3+ state, and thus the total number of valence electrons does not change with Cr-doping.  [ 45 ]  In this study, however, increase in Ce fi lling fraction for Cr-doped samples indicates a charge compensation and the acceptor role of Cr in Ce y CoSb 3 , similar to the effects of Fe-doping or Mn-doping at the Co site  [ 33, 34 ]  or Sn-doping or Ge-doping at the Sb site.  [ 35, 36 ]  This further suggests a divalent (Cr 2+ ) or monovalent (Cr + ) charge state of Cr which acts as charge scattering centers. The discrepancy is presumably due to the different Fermi levels, and the high chemical potential of our Ce-fi lled samples may drive Cr into lower valence states (Cr 2+ or Cr + ). More experiments, however, are needed to clarify the detailed valence state of Cr, such as magnetic susceptibility. Meanwhile, since τ I is proportional to T 3/2 , the strength of ionized impurity scattering decreases gradually with rising temperature, as evidenced by the rapid increase of | γ | with increasing temperature, and phonon scattering begins to dominate carrier transport at T > 500 K. The sharp decrease of mobility at elevated temperatures ( T > 600 K, µ H ~ T -2.5 ) is presumably due to the polar optical phonon scattering, intervalley scattering, or intensifi ed electron-hole coupling.  [ 46 ]  The ionized impurity scattering indexes ( a ) are numerically solved from the Seebeck coeffi cient and carrier concentration, and are plotted as a function of γ in Figure  2 d  impurity scattering, peaking at a = a 0 ( PF enhances by ≈7.3%). a 0 ≈ 1 while Fermi energy η = 1, and increases with increasing η , for example a 0 = 2.4 for η = 2 ( n = 4.6 × 10 20 cm -3 ). This result agrees well with the predictions of Ioffe  [ 25 ]  and Ure.  [ 24 ]  The increase in the Seebeck coeffi cient, due to the fi ltering of low-energy electrons by ionized impurity scattering, compensates or even overcompensates the reduction of mobility, giving rise to the power factor enhancement. This effect is in principle analogues to the fi ltering effect created by energy barriers.  [ 3 ]  Particularly, thermal conductivity can also be lowered due to the reduced electronic contribution and the intensifi ed phonon point defect scattering, and thus a large enhancement in ZT can be expected. The comparisons between the experimental data and the numerical calculations (solid lines) are shown in Figure  3  b-d. These calculations without any adjustable parameter show good agreement with the experimental results, especially for the Seebeck coeffi cient and the electrical conductivity. The discrepancies are mainly attributed to the variation of the Fermi level, as indicated in Table  1  . This further verifi es the rationality of the present simple model. The fi ts between calculated and experimental power factors are less satisfactory, mainly due to the variation of η and large uncertainty of PF (≈10%). Intensifi cation of ionized impurity scattering does not noticeably deteriorate the power factor, especially for the x = 0.1 samples with very low electrical conductivities.

High Temperature Thermoelectric Transport Properties
The high temperature electrical transport properties of Ce 0.25 Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 samples are shown in Figure  4  , and the experimental results of Ce 0.2 Co 3.9 Fe 0.1 Sb 12 ( a = 0.55, η = 1.66) and Ce 0.2 Co 3.875 Mn 0.025 Sb 12 ( a = 0.0, η = 1.56) from ref.  [ 33 ]  are also presented for comparison. To exclude the infl uence of Fermi energy variation and explicitly demonstrate the effects of ionized impurity scattering on thermoelectric properties, the transport properties of a hypothetical sample with same Fermi energy as the x = 0.  due to its high mobility, whereas Ce 0.2 Co 3.9 Fe 0.1 Sb 12 ( a = 0.55, η = 1.66) displays lower σ even with higher Fermi energy because of the intensifi ed ionized impurity scattering.  [ 33 ]  This intensifi cation of ionized impurity scattering also gives larger Seebeck coeffi cients in the whole temperature range for Ce 0.2 Co 3.9 Fe 0.1 Sb 12 ( a = 0.55, η = 1.66), analogue to the effect of Cr-doping in the present study. The enhanced Seebeck coeffi cients ensure high power factors over a wide temperature range, as shown in Figure  4 c . Cr-doped samples show moderate enhancement in the power factor, and the maximum value reaches 45 µW cm -1 K -2 which is comparable to those best results of Ce single fi lled CoSb 3 .  [ 33, 38 ]  It is further noted that the x = 0.1 sample ( a = 1.5, η = 1.38) shows ≈5%-10% PF enhancement in the whole temperature range over the hypothetical x = 0.1 sample ( a = 0.3, η = 1.38), consistent with the predications of Ioffe  [ 25 ]  and Ure  [ 24 ]  and in the present study. Thermal and the calculated electronic contribution κ e . κ e was estimated based on the Wiedemann-Franz law, κ e = LσT , where L is the Lorenz constant and taken as 2.0 × 10 -8 V 2 K -2 . κ decreases gradually with the increasing Cr content x , attributed to the decrease of both the electronic and the lattice contributions, as shown in Figure  5 b, c . κ L fi rst decreases with rising temperature due to the intensifi ed phonon-phonon Umklapp processes, and then increases slightly at elevated temperatures because of the bipolar contribution.  [ 47 ]  More importantly, κ L decreases gradually with the increasing Cr content due to the increased Ce fi lling fraction. κ L of Cr-doped samples is comparable to those of Fe-doped or Mn-doped Ce 0.2 Co 4 Sb 12 ,  [ 33 ]  as shown in Figure  5 c . κ L at 300 K as a function of fi lling fraction of Ce,  [ 33, 48 ]  Yb,  [ 49 ]  alkaline, and alkaline earth  [ 50 ]  are shown Figure  5 d . Our experimental results fi t well with the trend line of Ce-fi lled CoSb 3 .  [ 33, 48 ]  This indicates that the increase in Ce fi lling fraction is the dominant source of κ L reduction, and phonon defect Thermal properties of the hypothetical x = 0.1 sample ( a = 0.3, η = 1.38) with a predominant acoustic phonon scattering, Mn-and Fe-doped Ce 0.2 Co 4 Sb 12 [ 33 ] are shown as the dashed, solid, and dotted lines, respectively. d) Lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K as a function of fi lling fraction for Ce y Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 , and the fi lled circles of Ce-fi lled Co 4 Sb 12 are previous reported results  [ 33, 48 ]  (the solid line is a guide to the eye). The trend lines of alkali-fi lled, alkaline-earth-fi lled, and Yb-fi lled Co 4 Sb 12 [ 49 ] are also shown for comparison. scattering due to Cr-substitution at the Co sites is negligible in light of their comparable atomic masses and sizes. Compared with other fi llers, Ce is one of the most effective fi ller for κ L reduction due to its low rattling frequency (54 cm -1 ).  [ 51 ]  The low fi lling fraction of Ce (~0.1) in undoped CoSb 3 , however, limits κ L reduction and power factor optimization.  [ 51 ]  The charge compensation provided by Fe or Mn,  [ 33 ]  or by Cr in this study is an effective way to increase Ce fi lling fraction, which in turn optimizes carrier concentration and lowers κ L . Thermoelectric fi gure of merit ZT at 300 K as a function of ionized impurity scattering index a is shown in Figure  6  a, together with the results of the hypothetical x = 0.1 sample ( a = 0.3, η = 1.38), as well as the Fe-doped and Mn-doped Ce 0.2 Co 4 Sb 12 in ref.  [ 33 ]  . Considering the inevitable variations of the Fermi level and lattice thermal conductivity, the agreement between the theoretical model and experimental data is acceptable. As argued, proper intensifi cation of the ionized impurity scattering indeed increases ZT , e.g., ZT maximizes at a ≈ 1.6 with η = 1.4 ( n = 2.8 × 10 20 cm -3 ). The temperature dependences of ZT s for Ce 0.25 Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 are shown in Figure  6  b. Cr-doping gradually increases ZT and the maximum value reaches ≈1.3 for the x = 0.1 sample ( a = 1.5, η = 1.38), ≈30% improvement as compared with that of Ce 0.25 Co 4 Sb 12 . This maximum ZT is also comparable to those of the Fe-doped Ce 0.2 Co 4 Sb 12 [ 33 ] and the best values of single-fi lled skutterudites,  [ 51, 52 ]  and also ≈15% higher than that of the hypothetical x = 0.1 sample with the dominant acoustic phonon scattering for electrons ( a = 0.3, η = 1.38). In particular, the average ZT , crucial for the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric devices, is also appreciably improved, as shown in Figure  6 c . The average ZT of 0.9 between 300 and 850 K ( -300 850K

ZT
) for the x = 0.1 sample is ≈17% and ≈14% higher than those of the undoped and the hypothetical x = 0.1 ( a = 0.3, η = 1.38) samples, respectively. Even with comparable maximum ZT as the Fe-doped sample, the x = 0.1 sample ( a = 1.5, η = 1.38) shows more than 10% higher - 300 850K ZT and -500 850K

ZT
. The high ZT and average ZT are mainly originated from the intensifi ed ionized impurity scattering which ensures high α and PF in a wide temperature range, as well as reduced κ from both the lattice and the electronic contributions. Although the ZT enhancement is modest considering the measurement errors (≈15%), the good reproducibility and agreement with theoretical predications of thermoelectric transport properties explicitly demonstrate the benefi cial effect of ionized impurity scattering, which can be applied for other materials to achieve more signifi cant ZT enhancement. We further trust that even higher ZT can be achieved by optimizing the carrier concentration and/or impurity scattering index a , as well as by further decreasing κ L via multiple fi lling in CoSb 3 skutterudites.

Some Further Discussion about the Strategy of Ionized Impurity Scattering
It is believed that the strategy utilizing ionized impurity scattering to enhance thermoelectric properties can be widely applied to many other thermoelectric compounds, such as Bi 2 Te 3 , Mg 2 Si, etc. The key to the strategy is how to effectively introduce ionized impurity scattering and how to precisely control its proportion to realize PF and ZT enhancements. According to Equation ( 1) , large effective impurity concentration N I and small m d * are necessary to produce strong ionized impurity scattering for a material with a small enough K value (<100). Here N I is not only determined by the concentration of impurity centers N i (dopants) but also their charge states v , and roughly proportional to v 2 N i .  [ 22, 23 ]  Thus a highly charged impurity with high screened Coulomb potential will more effectively scatter low energy electrons, and give rise to higher electron entropy and higher Seebeck coeffi cient. This also accounts for the stronger ionized impurity scattering introduced by Cr Co defects, in comparison with Fe Co or Mn Co , as shown in Figure  1  a-c. In addition, another factor infl uencing the ionized impurity scattering strength is the characteristics of electronic band structure. In general, the ionized impurities located at the carrier transporting sublattices would more pronouncedly scatter the charge carriers. Therefore for n-type CoSb 3 , doping at the Co sites such as Ni, Fe, Cr, etc., more effectively introduces ionized impurity scattering, due to the fact that the conduction band bottom is mainly composed of transition metal d orbitals and some contributions from Sb p orbitals through the p-d hybridization.  [ 41 ]  Te-doping at the Sb sites, even with high dopant concentrations, has very limited effect on carrier scattering mechanism, as shown in Figure  1 b, c .  [ 20, 40 ]  In addition, the m d * for a given material has a limited room to adjust, and also seldom becomes a dominant parameter for ionized impurity scattering (also shown as square root in relaxation or mobility formulas, Equation (  1 )) . The optimal proportion of ionized impurity scattering strongly depends on the Fermi energy (carrier concentration) and other parameters such as m d *, and the concurrent dependence of Fermi energy and ionized impurity scattering strength on N I make precise control rather challenging. The diffi culty is also responsible for many unsuccessful attempts.  [ 7, 27 ]  Advanced theoretical calculations and sophisticated experiments are needed to control the ionized impurity scattering strength and the Fermi energy. Special attention should be paid to the preparation of polycrystalline samples, which may contain high density intrinsic defects, such as vacancies, interstitials, or antisite defects. These intrinsic defects may signifi cantly alter the scattering processes of charge carriers.

Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated that proper intensifi cation of the ionized impurity scattering can be an effective approach to improve the electrical transport properties and thermoelectric fi gure of merit ZT in n-type Cr-doped Ce y Co 4 Sb 12 . Here Cr-doping not only intensifi es the ionized impurity scattering and effi ciently increases the Seebeck coeffi cient, ensuring high power factors, but also noticeably reduces the lattice thermal conductivity by increasing the Ce fi lling fraction. A highest ZT of ≈1.3 can be achieved for Ce 0.25 Co 3.9 Cr 0.1 Sb 12 , ≈30% improvement over the Cr-free sample, and also comparable to the best values of single-fi lled CoSb 3 . In addition, the large average ZT s of 0.9 between 300 and 850 K as well as 1.1 between 500 and 850 K can be achieved with an optimal a value of 1.5, ≈15% higher than those of the sample assuming a dominant acoustic phonon scattering ( a = 0.3). We believe that this strategy can be applied for improving ZT of double-or triple-fi lled skutterudites or other thermoelectric compounds, by feasibly combining with other strategies such as band structure engineering, energy barrier fi ltering, nanostructuring, etc.

Experimental Section
Sample Synthesis and Characterization : All samples were prepared according to the stoichiometry Ce y Co 4-x Cr x Sb 12 ( x = 0-0.1; y = 0.2, 0.25) by a conventional melting-quenching-annealing-sintering method. High purity Co shots (99.995%, Alfa Aesar), Cr chunks (99.99%, Sigma Aldrich), Sb shots (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and Ce chunks (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) were weighed stoichiometrically, loaded into carbon-coated quartz tubes in an argon-fi lled glove-box (Mbraun, lab star, Germany) and vacuum sealed (10 -3 Torr). The tubes with raw materials were placed into a box furnace, heated to 1100 °C in 5 h, soaked at this temperature for 24 h, and then rapidly quenched in ice water. The obtained ingots were ultrasonically cleaned and vacuum sealed in quartz tubes, then annealed in a box furnace at 750 °C for 168 h. After annealing, the ingots were crushed, hand grounded into fi ne powders and sintered into bulk materials using spark plasma sintering at ≈650 °C and 50 MPa for 5 min. 1.5-2 mm thick circular sheets with diameter 12.7 mm, 3 × 3 × 12 mm 3 , and 0.3 × 2.5 × 8 mm 3 rectangular bars were cut for thermoelectric properties and Hall effect measurements. The phase purities of bulk samples were determined by powder XRD (Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffraction) using the Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1.5406 Å), and lattice parameters were calculated using the full profi le Rietveld refi nement method in the FullProf_Suite software. Backscattered electron images were collected in a Hitachi TM3000 electron microscope equipped with a Bruker EDX. The chemical compositions were determined by an FEI Sirion fi eld emission scanning electron microscope equipped with EDX (FESEM/EDX). The electrical conductivity ( σ ) and Seebeck coeffi cient ( α ) were simultaneously measured by a commercial equipment (ZEM-3, Ulvac Riko, Inc.) under a low-pressure helium atmosphere. Thermal conductivity ( κ ) was calculated from the measured thermal diffusivity ( λ ), specifi c heat ( C p ), and density ( d ) using the relationship κ = λC p d . Thermal diffusivity λ was tested by the laser fl ash method using a Netzsch LFA-457 system, and specifi c heat ( C p ) was measured by a Netzsch DSC 404F1 using sapphire as the reference. The measurement temperature ranges from 300 to 850 K. Uncertainties in electrical conductivity, Seebeck coeffi cient, thermal conductivity, and ZT are estimated to be ±5%, ±3%, ±10%, and ±15%, respectively. The high temperature Hall coeffi cient measurements (300-700 K) were performed on a home-made Hall system equipped with a 2 T electromagnet, with a four-probe confi guration. Carrier concentration  The neutral impurity scattering should be negligible at high temperatures compared with lattice or ionized impurity scattering.  [ 23, 53 ]  Electronelectron couplings, tending to randomize drift velocity of electrons, could be rather effective when ionized impurity scattering dominates in carrier transport, as suggested by Herring or Debye.  [ 23 ]  The effect of electronelectron couplings had been discussed in detail elsewhere by Debye and Conwell.  [ 23, 31 ]  In this study we neglect the effect of electron-electron couplings, and detailed discussion of their effect is beyond the scope of present study. In addition, we did not use the Brooks-Herring formula or other variants to quantitatively describe the strength of ionized impurity scattering, due to the break-down of the Brooks-Herring formula at high impurity level ( N I > 10 17 cm -3 ) and high temperatures ( T > 300 K).  [ 31 ]  Under the relaxation time approximation for mixed lattice and ionized impurity scatterings and SPB assumption, the transport equations as functions of the reduced Fermi level η and ionized impurity scattering index a are expressed as  where F 1/2 ( η ) is the Fermi integral of the order of 1/2. For given η and κ L , the electrical transport properties as functions of ionized impurity scattering index a ( a ≥ 0) can be numerically calculated. Some physical parameters used for calculations were taken from literatures, such as C = × 1.5 10 GPa , [ 54 ] Ξ = 6.5 eV,  [ 55 ]  and N v = 3 for the conduction band.  [ 56 ]  First-Principles Calculations : All fi rst-principles calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package.  [ 57 ]  Generalized gradient approximation functional  [ 58 ]  and projected augmented wave methods  [ 59 ]  were used. We adopted a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the Co 4 Sb 12 unit in all the calculations, which is large enough for the defect study in skutterudites.  [ 37 ]  Spin-polarization is considered in the electronic structure calculations.
