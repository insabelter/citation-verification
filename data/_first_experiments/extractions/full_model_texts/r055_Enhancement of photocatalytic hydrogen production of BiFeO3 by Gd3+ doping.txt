Introduction
In recent years, sustainable energy is paid more and more attention due to its characteristics of economy, environmental friendliness and social benefits  [1, 2] . As one of sustainable energies, hydrogen (H 2 ) can approach challenges of greenhouse effect and environmental sustainability. And the photocatalytic production of H 2 and O 2 by water splitting using photocatalysts receives an impressive amount of attention because of its great economic and environmental interest  [3] . In the process of photocatalytic H 2 production, electron-hole (e h + ) pairs are generated when photons with energy higher than or equal to the band gap energy (E g ) hit the photocatalyst. The produced electrical charges are used to dissociate water. The process of photocatalytic water splitting contains photo reduction and photo oxidation reactions, which can be written as: Photo reduction:2H O 2e H 2OH 2 h 2 + + ( 1 ) Photo oxidation:2H O O 4H 4e 2 h 2 + + + (2) Generally, the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst is determined by its light absorption, generation of e h + pairs, re- combination and separation of e h + pairs, migration of e h + pairs, charge carrier trapping and transfer of e h + pairs to water  [4] . It has been almost 50 years since Fujishima and Honda reported the water spilling to H 2 and O 2 using the TiO 2 photocatalyst  [5, 6] . Except for TiO 2 , various types of photocatalysts were reported in these years, such as titanate  [7, 8] , AM 2 O 4 (A = Cu and Zn, M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co)  [9, 10] , tantalite (niobate)  [11, 12] , sulphide  [13, 14] , ferrite  [15, 16]  and some oxide semiconductor  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . BiFeO 3 is a perovskite-type multiferroic compound, which shows potential applications in spintronics devices due to its high ferroelectric and magnetic phase transitions, as well as large remanent polarization at room temperature  [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, it shows excellently photovoltaic effect and photocatalytic activity because that it can absorb a wide range of sunlight corresponding to its small E g  [26] [27] [28] . For the applications in the photocatalyst field, one of advantages of BiFeO 3 is its excellently magnetic property. It is known that the separation of photocatalysts is essential after the photocatalytic process. Generally, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation are widely used in the separation process although they are complex and expensive  [29, 30] . But the separation process will be easy if the photocatalyst has the magnetism. It means that the photocatalyst can be separated easily by applying an exterior magnetic field. There are some reports for BiFeO 3 in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water  [27, 28, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] ]. Chen's work shows that the hydrothermally-synthesized BiFeO 3 nanocrystals have excellently photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation under visible light irradiation and the surface oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic activity effectively  [37] . Other reports indicate that the photocatalytic activity of BiFeO 3 can be enhanced by doping ions, such as Sm and Mn  [34, 35] , La and Se  [36] , and Gd  [31] [32] [33] . However, little or no report keeps a watchful eye on the influence of ion doping on photocatalytic hydrogen production of BiFeO 3 . In this work, we report the sol-gel synthesis and the photocatalytic hydrogen production of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ . The results show that the photocatalytic hydrogen production can be increased by Gd 3+ doping.

Materials and method
BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ were synthesized by a sol-gel method. The Gd 3+ doping concentration is 5%mol. In the synthesis, Bi(NO 3 ) 3 •5H 2 O (99.0%), Fe(NO 3 ) 3 •9H 2 O (99.99%) and Gd(NO 3 ) 3 •6H 2 O (99.99%) were used as starting materials. Deionized water was used as the solvent. Citric acid and ethylene glycol were used as additives. In a typical synthesis of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ , 40 mL of ethylene glycol was mixed with 80 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring for 20 min. Then, 2 g of Citric acid was added into the mixed solution under vigorous stirring for 20 min. Subsequently, 7.5 mmol of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 •5H 2 O, 8 mmol of Fe (NO 3 ) 3 •9H 2 O and 0.5 mmol of Gd(NO 3 ) 3 •6H 2 O were added into the above solution under vigorous stirring for 120 min. The obtained solution was continuously stirred for 100 min at 80 ºC to form the sol. Finally, the formed sol was transferred into a culture dish and dried at 100 ºC till the gel was obtained and the obtained gel was calcined at 550 ºC for 120 min. The synthesis process of BiFeO 3 was similar with that of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ . The phase was confirmed by a Rigaku D/max2550VB X-ray powder diffractometer at a voltage of 40 Kv and a current of 30 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The data were recorded in a 2θ angle of 20-70 º with a scan speed of 10 º/min. The microstructure was performed on a JSM-6700F scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The synthesized samples were dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonicator and dropped on a carbon grid. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained by a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using an integrating-sphere accessory in the light wavelength range of 200-800 nm and BaSO 4 was used as a reflectance standard. The hysteresis loops were recorded by a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (Lakeshore VSM 7410) in the external field from -9T to +9T. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E Chenhua Instrument Company, Shanghai, China) containing a standard three-electrode system. In the system, the Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfect Light Co. Ltd., Beijing) served as the light source, and 0.5 M Na 2 S aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The abilities of photocatalytic hydrogen production for BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ were evaluated in a batch reactor. 0.1 g of photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of solution with the H 2 O/CH 3 OH volume ratio of 9:1. Before the photocatalysis, the reaction system was evacuated firstly by a mechanical pump and filled subsequently with N 2 for the purpose of removing O 2 . The process was repeated 2 times. Then, the mixture was irradiated by the simulated sunlight. The generated H 2 was collected by the water displacement technique and the amount was measured by an online gas chromatograph.

Results and discussion
The single phase of the synthesized BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ was confirmed by the XRD technique. Fig.  1  gives the XRD patterns of BiFeO 3 , BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ and the standard data of JCPDs card no. 86-1518. The diffractions fit well with the standard data of JCPDs card no. 86-1518, which suggests the successful synthesis of BiFeO 3 and Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ with rhombohedral structure (space group R3c). Due to the same valence and similar radii of Bi 3+ (1.170 Å, CN=8) and Gd 3+ (1.053 Å, CN=8)  [38] , Gd 3+ ions substitute Bi 3+ sites in BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ . This substitution also can be revealed by the shifts of diffraction peaks to the larger angles. The substitution of smaller Gd 3+ to Bi 3+ leads to the decrease of lattice distance and thus induces the decrease of unit cell, which results in the shift of diffraction peaks to larger angles  [39, 40] . No signals for Gd element are detected, indicating that Gd 3+ has doped into BiFeO 3 host entirely and formed solid state solution. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of the synthesized BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ was evaluated under the simulated sunlight irradiation using methanol as the hole-scavenger. Fig.  2  gives the dependence of hydrogen production on irradiation time in the photocatalysis process with the presence of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ . The rates of hydrogen production for BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ are about 21.9 and 67.6 μmol•cm -2 •h -1 , respectively. It can be seen that the rate of Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ is more than three times of the BiFeO 3 . The results demonstrate that BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ has a larger photocatalytic activity than that of BiFeO 3 . It is known that the ability of hydrogen production for a particulate photocatalyst depends on its crystallinity, microstructure, optical and electronic properties  [41] . To find out the mechanism of the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ , a series of physical and chemical properties of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ were investigated and compared. Fig.  3  shows the microstructural analysis of BiFeO 3 (Fig.  3A ) and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ (Fig.  3B ). The SEM images show that a large number of  irregular nanoparticles were produced by the sol-gel process. There are agglomerations between particles. But the agglomeration does not influence the band gap of samples  [34] . In the sol-gel synthesis, the complexing ligands of precursor xerogel wrote over the produced nanocrystals and thus prevented the agglomeration. But the subsequent calcination induced the evaporation of citrate complexing agents. Thus, the nanocrystals agglomerated and grow to be larger due to their high surface energy. These led to the final microstructure of the synthesized photocatalysts. Fig.  3C  and Fig.  3D  provide the size distribution of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ , respectively. The results indicate that the size  distribution is similar. The XRD an SEM results suggest the morphology, particle size and distribution of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ are similar. Therefore, the effects of crystallinity and microstructure on photocatalytic activities of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ are same. The optical properties of the synthesized BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ were investigated. Fig.  4A  gives the UV-Vis DRS of BiFeO 3 and Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm. BiFeO 3 shows the strong absorption band in ultraviolet light region and the weak absorption band in visible light region. BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ has the same absorption bands with BiFeO 3 , but the absorption intensities are higher than those of BiFeO 3 . The absorption band in ultraviolet light region corresponds to charge transfer from valence O2p states to the conduction-band Fe3d states  [42] . The absorption band in visible light region is induced by the vacancies of oxygen  [43] . And the obvious enhancement of absorption intensity in visible light region for Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ is induced by the increased vacancies of oxygen  [44] . The results show that BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ has a larger absorption capability and a longer wavelength of absorption band edge than that of BiFeO 3 . The band gap energy was calculated by the Kubelka-Munk formula of ( h ) A(h ) g n 2

=
, where is the absorption coefficient, h is the photon energy, n is a constant having the values of 2 and 4 for direct and indirect band gaps, and A is a constant  [45] . The results are shown in Fig.  4B . The calculated E g for BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ are 2.28 and 2.17 eV, respectively. The E g of BiFeO 3 is the measure of energy gap between the top of the O (2p)-Fe (3d) mixed valence-band and bottom of the Fe 3d conduction band  [46] . Umebayashi et al. have found that the 3d metal doping leads to the generation of the occupied level in the valence band or the band gap because of the t 2g state of the doped ions  [47, 48] . The doped Gd 3+ in BiFeO 3 induces the formation of impurity levels in the forbidden band, which leads to the shifts in the donor level above the original valence band or an acceptor level under the original conduction band  [49] . These result in the decrease of E g for Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ . Moreover, the increased vacancies of oxygen in Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ also result in the decrease of E g  [50] . For a photocatalyst, the effective generation, separation and recombination of e h + pairs have obvious influence on photocatalytic activity. The generation, separation and recombination of e h + pairs can be demonstrated by the photocurrent. Fig.  5  gives the photocurrent curves of BiFeO 3 and 3 :Gd 3+ in four on-off cycles under simulated sunlight irradiation. The BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ shows higher photocurrent intensity than that of BiFeO 3 , which suggests the higher efficient generation and separation of e h + pairs and the longer lifetime of charger carriers for BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ . The charge separation of e h + pairs on the interface of the photocatalyst also can be revealed by the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). And the reaction rate on the surface of the photocatalyst can be revealed by the radius of the EIS. The radius of EIS is smaller, the separation of e h + pairs and the charger transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface are more efficient  [51] . Fig.  6  shows the EIS of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ measured in the triode-electrode configuration with a sinusoidal alternating-current perturbation of 10 mV. The radius of the semicircle in the plot of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ is smaller, suggesting that Gd 3+ doping benefits the separation of e h + pairs and promotes the charger transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optical and photoelectrochemical properties demonstrate that the higher photocatalytic activity of Bi-FeO 3 :Gd 3+ in photocatalytic hydrogen production results from the efficient generation, separation and migration of e h + pairs. To investigate the magnetic properties of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ , the magnetization-magnetic field (M-H) curves were measured at room temperature. The results are shown in Fig.  7 . It can be seen that BiFeO 3 has a nearly linear magnetic field dependence on the magnetization but BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ shows a hysteresis loop, which means a higher magnetic property of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ . And this suggests that BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ can be separated easily after the photocatalysis process in the solution. The magnetic separation of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ was tested by placing a magnet beside the glass beaker. The samples were collected by the magnet in   30 s, suggesting that an easy and efficient way for the separation of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ in solution. The higher magnetic property of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ than that of BiFeO 3 can be attributed the following reasons  [30] . Firstly, the substitution of smaller Gd 3+ to Bi 3+ results in the larger lattice distortion, which leads to the suppression of the spiral spin modulation. Secondly, the Gd 3+ -Fe 3+ couples in BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ also induce the enhancement of magnetic property.

Conclusion
We fabricated BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ photocatalysts successfully through a sol-gel phase. The BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ shows higher photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production than that of BiFeO 3 . By the measurements of the phase, microstructure, optical and photoelectrochemical properties, we conclude that the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ comes from the more efficient generation, separation and migration of e h + pairs. By Gd 3+ doping, the E g becomes to be smaller; the absorption ability of sunlight becomes to be stronger; the separation and migration of e h + pairs become to be more efficient. As a result, the photocatalytic activity is enhanced highly. The higher magnetic property of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ suggests that the collection in the solution is easier. The physical and chemical properties demonstrate that BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ has potential application in photocatalytic hydrogen production.
