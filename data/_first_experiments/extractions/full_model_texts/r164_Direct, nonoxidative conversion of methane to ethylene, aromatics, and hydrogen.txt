T he challenge of converting natural gas into transportable fuels and chemicals (1) has been spurred by several emerging industrial trends, including rapidly rising demand for H 2 (for upgrading lower-quality oils) and a global shortage of aromatics caused by shifting refinery targets toward gasoline. Light olefins, which are key chemical feedstocks, are currently made from methanol, which itself is made through multistage catalytic transformations via syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) 
(2, 3) , although there is also ongoing research to convert syngas directly to light olefins  (4, 5) . However, in all such approaches, either CO or H 2 is needed to remove oxygen from CO, resulting in a carbon-atom utilization efficiency below 50%. Despite their low efficiency, high capital and production costs, and enormous CO 2 emissions, syngas routes dominate current and near-term industrial practices for natural gas conversion (6, 7). Direct conversion of CH 4 is potentially more economical and environmentally friendly but is challenging because CH 4 exhibits high C-H bond strength (434 kJ/mol), negligible electron affinity, large ionization energy, and low polarizability  (8) . In the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin in the early 1980s, CH 4 was activated with the assistance of oxygen  (9) . This finding initiated a worldwide research surge to explore the high-temperature (>1073 K) oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C 2 hydrocarbons  (10, 11) . Hundreds of catalytic materials have since been synthesized and tested, principally during the 1990s, as well as in recent years. Unfortunately, the presence of O 2 leads irreversibly to overoxidation, resulting in a large amount of the thermodynamically stable endproducts CO 2 and H 2 O. Thus, the carbon utilization efficiency of OCM remains relatively low  (12, 13) . Slow progress in discovering new catalysts to circumvent this problem has hindered further development, and no economically viable process has been put into practice so far. In a recent report, elemental sulfur was used as a softer oxidant than O 2  (14) : For a 5% CH 4 /Ar mixture at 1323 K, the best catalyst, PdS/ZrO 2 , gave a CH 4 conversion of ~16% and ethylene selectivity near 20%, albeit at the expense of the by-products CS 2 and H 2 S  (14) . In contrast, the bifunctional catalysts based on Mo/zeolites catalyze CH 4 conversion to aromatics (benzene and naphthalene) nonoxidatively, thereby avoiding CO 2 formation  (15) (16) (17) (18) . CH 4 is activated on the metal sites forming CH x species, which dimerize to C 2 H y . Subsequent oligomerization on the acidic sites located inside the zeolite pores yields benzene and naphthalene, as well as copious amounts of coke  (19) (20) (21) . Commercial prospects for this process are further hampered by the instability of zeolites at the very high reaction temperatures. To achieve direct conversion of CH 4 efficiently, the challenges lie in cleaving the first C-H bond while suppressing further catalytic dehydrogenation, avoiding both CO 2 generation and coke deposition. We report that these conditions can be met using lattice-confined single iron sites embedded in a silica matrix. These sites activate CH 4 in the absence of oxidants, generating methyl radicals, which desorb from the catalyst surface and then undergo a series of gas-phase reactions to yield ethylene, benzene, and naphthalene as the only products (with ethylene dominating at short space-times for a selectivity of ~52.7% at 1293 K). A methane conversion as high as 48.1% is achieved at 1363 K. The catalysts were obtained by fusing ferrous metasilicate with SiO 2 at 1973 K in air and from commercial quartz, followed by leaching with aqueous HNO 3 and drying at 353 K (22). The resulting catalyst was designated 0.5% Fe©SiO 2 (© denotes confinement and here represents a catalyst characterized by the lattice-confined single iron sites embedded within a silica matrix). It contained 0.5 weight percent (wt %) Fe and had a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of <1 m 2 /g. The catalyst was activated in a fixed-bed microreactor in the reaction atmosphere [90 volume percent (vol %) CH 4 /N 2 ] at 1173 K. The effluent was analyzed by online gas chromatography (GC). At 1223 K, CH 4 conversion was 8.1% (Fig.  1A ) and increased with temperature, exceeding 48.1% at 1363 K (Fig.  1B ). Only ethylene, benzene, and naphthalene were produced; neither coke nor CO 2 was detected, despite the relatively high reaction temperature. A single-pass yield of 48% hydrocarbons is achieved at 1363 K and 21.4 liters per gram of catalyst (gcat) per hour. Selectivities vary from 40.9 to 52.1% for ethylene, 21.0 to 29.1 for benzene, and 23.6 to 38.2% for naphthalene, over the investigated temperature range (1223 to 1363 K). By comparison, a blank experiment (an empty reactor with no catalyst) under the same conditions showed a CH 4 conversion of only 2.5%, and 95% of the product was coke (Fig.  1A ). A test with unmodified SiO 2 as the catalyst yielded virtually the same result (table  S1 ) (22). Most notably, the use of 0.5 wt % Fe/SiO 2 as the catalyst (prepared with wet impregnation on amorphous SiO 2 with a high surface area, 348 m 2 /g) (  22 ) also led to high coke formation (>98%). We have varied the iron loadings, support materials, and preparation methods, which unfortunately do not preclude coke on iron nanoparticles (NPs). For example, coke remained the principal product (>50%) over 0.5% Fe/ZSM. 0.8% Fe/SiO 2 prepared by sol-gel method and 0.2% Fe/SiC (22) enhanced selective formation of hydrocarbons to some extent, but still with a considerable amount of coke (Fig.  1A ). Figure  S1  (22) demonstrates that the reactivity of 0.5% Fe©SiO 2 was very reproducible. All mass balances are above 99%. At 1363 K, the space-time yields for ethylene, benzene, and naphthalene were 91, 18, and 9 mol kgcat -1 hour -1 , respectively. Moreover, the process represents a new and sustainable approach to H 2 production because the by-products are high-value-added hydrocarbons (ethylene and aromatics) instead of coke and CO 2  (23, 24) . The yield of H 2 varies with the reaction conditions, and the concentrations in the effluent range from 10.9 to 51.2% (fig.  1D ) (22). Furthermore, the 0.5% Fe©SiO 2 catalyst was very stable, and no deactivation was observed during a 60-hour test at 1293 K (Fig.  1C ). Methane conversion remained at ~32% throughout this long run. Selectivities to ethylene (52.7%), benzene (21.5%), and naphthalene (25.8%) were constant, and the total selectivity to these products remained >99%. The combination of atomeconomy, high selectivity, and high conversion is notable, considering the rather low loading of Fe (0.5 wt %) and very low surface area (<1 m 2 /g) of the SiO 2 . Although noncatalytic pyrolysis of CH 4 has been extensively studied for light hydrocarbon synthesis, the product is dominated with acetylene accompanied by high coke formation  (25) (26) (27) . By comparison, the catalytically initiated reaction described here compares very favorably with other reported direct-conversion processes, including pyrolysis, OCM  (13) , and nonoxidative aromatization  (21) . Finally, because natural gas usually contains some ethane, we added 1 and 5 vol % ethane to the reactant stream. The presence of ethane substantially enhanced methane conversion (fig.  S2 ) (  22 ), and ethane is almost completely converted, although a small amount of coke is formed at 1173 K and a space velocity of 4.84 liter gcat -1 h -1 . The unprecedented efficiency of the catalytically initiated CH 4 conversion process is attributed to the high activity of the coordinatively unsaturated iron sites toward the C-H bond of CH 4  (28, 29) . The isolated nature of these sites, as evidenced by sub-angstrom-resolution high-angle annular-dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), precludes surface C-C coupling and, hence, coke formation. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that in the fresh 0.5% Fe©SiO 2 catalyst, iron oxide NPs with a size of ~3 to 4 nm are distributed homogeneously throughout the SiO 2 matrix (fig.  S3 ) (22). A STEM-HAADF image of the catalyst after reaction reveals many bright dots of atomic size scattered across the SiO 2 matrix, highlighted by the red circles in Fig.  2A . Each dot represents an individual Fe atom, considering the much lower contrast of Si and O in the HAADF image. This result suggests that the iron species are redistributed from the original oxide NPs to isolated atoms during catalyst activation. This hypothesis is validated by the in situ XANES during activation. The near-edge spectrum of the catalyst is similar to that of Fe foil (Fig.  2B ). In Fig.  2C , the Fourier-transformed k 3 -weighted c(k) function (where k is wave number)  (30)  shows that, after activation, the Fe-O scattering paths apparent in the spectrum of the fresh catalyst (line 1) have disappeared, whereas new scattering paths appear (line 2). They are assigned to Fe-C and Fe-Si paths, by comparison to the spectra of reference materials such as Fe 2 O 3 , FeSi 2 , and iron carbides  (31) . In the presence of CH 4 above 1173 K, iron oxide species in the fresh 0.5% Fe©SiO 2 interact extensively with the support, becoming embedded in the silica matrix through bonding to Si and C atoms. Thus, these otherwise extremely reactive, coordinatively unsaturated iron atoms are stabilized and persist under the very harsh reaction conditions. No aggregation was observed, even after prolonged reaction for 60 hours. In contrast, the 2-to 5-nm-sized iron NPs in 0.5% Fe/SiO 2 (fig.  S5a ) (22) after activation under the same conditions exhibit only a Fe-Fe bond (line 3 in Fig.  2, B  and C ). This result explains the extensive carbon deposition observed for 0.5% Fe/SiO 2 , considering that iron NPs are widely used for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes  (32) . That process involves catalytic cleavage of C-H bonds and dissolution of carbon species into the iron lattice. Subsequent C-C coupling on an iron NP surface and crystallization from the supersaturated carbide solid solution drive the growth of nanotubes  (33) . However, under the harsh reaction conditions in the current reaction, 0.5% Fe/SiO 2 deactivates very rapidly, and iron NPs aggregated and grew to 20 to 30 nm after reaction (fig.  S4b ) (22). These results again highlight the crucial role played by the site isolation of the iron species in 0.5% Fe©SiO 2 in achieving high selectivity toward hydrocarbons and preventing coke formation. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the most stable structure in the reactive atmosphere is an iron atom coordinated by one Si and two C atoms and is thus embedded within the SiO 2 matrix, as depicted in Fig.  3A  and fig.  S5 . The calculated Fe-C and Fe-Si bond lengths are 1.6 and 2.4 Å, respectively, which are consistent with those estimated from extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (table  S2 ) (22). This lattice-confined single iron site initiates CH 4 dehydrogenation by generating a •CH 3 radical, which subsequently releases from the surface with an energy barrier of 2.32 eV instead of undergoing further dehydrogenation or C-C coupling (fig.  S5 ) (22). The Fe site is then exposed and becomes active for adsorption of a second methane molecule and release of another methyl radical, with energy barriers of 3.07 and 2.19 eV, respectively (Fig.  3A ). Migration of H from C in Fe-C-Si sites to Fe involves a barrier of 0.58 eV. The resulting surface H species desorbs as H 2 with an energy barrier of 1.61 eV. The intermediacy of methyl radicals was verified by online vacuum ultraviolet soft photoionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (VUV-SPI-MBMS) (fig.  S6 ) (22). Molecules were ionized with a 10.6-eV VUV lamp, which has an energy lower than the CH 4 ionization energy (12.6 eV). This allows detection of intermediate radicals and products  (34, 35) . To further elucidate the mechanism, the reaction profile of methyl radicals at 1225 K was simulated with DFT (Fig.  3C  and fig.  S7 ) (22). Two •CH 3 radicals combine to form C 2 H 6 via a strongly exothermic process. C 2 H 6 undergoes dehydrogenation readily, giving C 2 H 4 and H atoms with an energy barrier of 1.58 eV. By abstraction of H from C 2 H 4 , the resulting •C 2 H 3 radical tends to react with additional C 2 H 4 molecules. Further dehydrogenation and cyclization leads to benzene, with an energy barrier of 2.85 eV. C 6 H 6 is also readily dehydrogenated by •H and, after further chain growth and cyclization, yields the thermodynamically more stable naphthalene. The low barrier for transformation of C 2 H 6 to C 2 H 4 explains the absence of C 2 H 6 among the experimentally observed products under steady-state reaction conditions, whereas the thermodynamically more stable hydrocarbons C 2 H 4 , C 6 H 6 , and C 10 H 8 accumulated and were detected. At equilibrium at 1225 K and atmospheric pressure, the yields of C 2 H 4 , C 6 H 6 , and C 10 H 8 from CH 4 were estimated to be 9.0, 34.0, and 57.0% (22), respectively. The relative ratios of these products could be manipulated by changing the reaction conditions. For example, increasing the CH 4 flow rate in the VUV-SPI-MBMS re-actor favors formation of C 2 H 4 (Fig.  3D ), whereas lower flow rates (corresponding to longer residence times) promote cyclization of intermediates leading to aromatics, which are consistent with the GC analysis obtained in the microreactor. These results lend further support to the hypothesis that the reaction is initiated by the catalytic generation of methyl radicals, which subsequently undergo a series of gas-phase reactions. Thus, the conversion efficiency is high, despite the very limited number of surface iron sites and the extremely low surface area of the catalyst. Heterogeneous systems for CH 4 activation generally still suffer from poor carbon utilization, caused in part by low selectivity. Here, we demonstrate an atom-economical direct CH 4 conversion process, enabled by the lattice-confined single iron sites embedded within a silica matrix, which activate CH 4 and generate methyl radicals. A conversion as high as 48.1% was obtained at 1363 K and a space velocity of 21.4 liter gcat -1 hour -1 , with a selectivity to C 2 H 4 of >48.4% (the remainder being aromatics). No deactivation was observed even after reaction for 60 hours, and the total carbon selectivity to the three products remained >99%. Although the dehydrogenation itself is endothermic, high selectivity to ethylene in this process substantially reduces the heat input (estimated to be about half that of a typical thermal pyrolysis process with dominating acetylene in product), as shown in table  S3 (22) . These findings open up new possibilities for fundamental studies of direct, nonoxidative activation of CH 4 . It is anticipated that combining a catalyst such as this one with an efficient reactor technology may enable the development of non-syngas-based routes to transform light hydrocarbons into highvalue-added chemicals.
