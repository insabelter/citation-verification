One of the challenges in modern electrochemistry is to improve the cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic electrolyte systems comprised of organic solvents and Li salts, where lithium is apparently stable. The achievement of high reversibility for lithium electrodes will obviously advance the development of reliable commercial secondary batteries of the highest energy density. A variety of polar aprotic solvent systems have been investigated in the past two decades 
(1, 2) . Several attempts to correlate lithium cycling efficiency with the physical and electrical properties of the polar aprotic media (e.g., conductivity, solvation parameters, viscosity, etc.) have been reported  (3, 4) . However, it is widely believed that the major factor that controls the electrochemical behavior of the lithium electrode in polar aprotic systems is the nature of the films formed on the electrode surface  (5, 6) . Several research groups have tried to improve the reversibility of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic systems by modifying the 'natural' surface films by an addition of traces of active reagents to the solutions  (7) (8) (9) (10) . Consequently, we have investigated in recent studies the nature of surface films formed on lithium electrodes in four important polar aprotic solvents: ~-butyrolactone (BL)  (11) , propylene carbonate  (12) , THF, and dimethoxy ethane (DME)  (13) . Surface-sensitive Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)  (11) (12) (13) , and to some extent also x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  (12) (13)  and SIMS  (13)  techniques were applied. We also investigated the electrochemical behavior of these four solvent systems with noble metal electrodes  (14) (15) (16) . This work  (14) (15) (16)  has the advantage that electroreduction of the solvents and contaminants, which occur simultaneously on lithium surfaces, could be explored separately on noble metal electrodes at low potentials, since these processes are very potential-dependent (the reduction potential of oxygen dissolved in polar aprotic solvents, for instance, is about 2V more positive than that of lithium deposition)  (17) (18) . In all four solvent-noble metal systems, the presence of oxygen and water was found to affect lithium dissolution and deposition processes  (15, 16) . The present work aims to study the effect of water and trace 02 on the reversibility of lithium electrodes in BL, PC, and THF, and to correlate cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in these systems to surface morphology, studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and surface chemistry, studied by FrIR. It was interesting to explore *Electrochemical Society Active Member. whether 02 or H20 contaminants may be used as surface modification agents for Li electrodes in these solvents, since these contaminants pronouncedly affect Li deposition on noble metals in these solvents  (14) (15) (16) . The influence of the salt anion on surface morphology and cycling efficiency of the Li electrode was also studied and is discussed in light of elemental analysis data obtained from Li electrodes treated in these electrolyte systems.

Experimental
The electrochemical measurements and all the preparations for the spectral studies were carried out at room temperature under a high purity argon atmosphere in Vacuum Atmospheres Corporation (VAC, USA) glove boxes fitted with HE 493 dry trains (VAC) for moisture and oxygen removal. Oxygen and moisture levels in the glove boxes were monitored continuously by a 1431-DP Ondyne (USA) moisture analyzer and a 317AX Teledyne (USA) oxygen analyzer, and were usually in the ppm level. Water concentration in the solutions was measured with a Metrohm (Swiss) 652 Karl Fisher Coulometer. Materials.--High purity ~-butyrolactone (Merck), propylene carbonate (Aldrich), tetrahydrofuran (Frutarom, Israel), LiC104.3H20 (Alfa product), LiAsF5 (USS Agrichemical), lithium foils 1 mm thick (Foote Minerals), and high purity argon, oxygen and nitrogen (Oxygen Center, Israel) were used. Purification of solvents and salts as well as the preparation of oxygen-or water-contaminated solutions has been described elsewhere  (11) (12) (13) 19) . Instrumentation.--The electrochemical treatments and measurements were carried out with a PAR potentiostat (Model 173) fitted with a digital coulometer (Model 179), programmer (Model 175) and Yokogawa XY recorder (Model 3083). FTIR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 60SXB spectrometer equipped with a ditriglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector. The sample chamber of the spectrometer provides isolation from the room atmosphere and was constantly purged with dry air or nitrogen (CO2-free, dew point of -60~ Solvent purity analysis by GCMS was carried out with a Finnigan 4000 mass spectrometer. In most cases a two-meter glass column filled with SP 1000 0.1% Carbopack C (Supelco) was used. NMR analysis was carried out with a Bruker AM 300 spectrometer. SEM measurements were carried out with JSM 840 scanning electron microscope (JEOL). Electrochemical measurements.--Cycling efficiency measurements were carried out in the cell shown in Fig.  1 .

The cell used for cycling efficiency measurements of lithium electrodes: 1 ) nickel or copper disk (working electrode) on which lithium is deposited; 2) lithium disk, counterelectrode attached to a copper rod; 3) lithium wire reference electrode; 4) o space for solution; 5) polyethylene bodies in which the electrodes are embedded; 6) a Teflon cylinder; and 7) glass tubes. An initial amount of lithium (several coulombs per cm 2) was deposited on a nickel or copper electrode. Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency. Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc  [1]  where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively. The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +. Typical measurements of working electrode potential changes during cycling efficiency experiments are illustrated in Fig.  2 . A periodic galvanostatic operation of the cell described in Fig.  1  was carried out by triggering the PAR (Model 173) potentiostat (set to galvanostatie mode) by a square waveform generator built specially for these experiments. ,Spectroscopic measurements.--The FTIR measurements of Li electrodes are described in detail elsewhere  (11) (12) (13) . Tile SEM measurements were conducted as follows. After the electrochemical treatments, the electrodes were taken out of the cell, washed (pure solvent) and dried (evacuation). Pieces were cut from each electrode and were loaded on the transfer system built specially for this work. Figure  3  shows the transfer system built for the SEM studies. The samples are loaded in the glove box on the Galvanostatlc charge-discharge cycling, 0.5 mA/cm 2. The charge involved in initial lithium deposition was about 2.5 C/cm 2. The last process was dissolution of the residual lithium. The dashed line indicates uncontaminated solution, and the solid line, oxygen-saturated solution. sample tray  [11]  (see Fig.  3 ). Then, the sample tray  [11]  is introduced to the cylinder  [2]  by the manipulator  [13] , and put on tray  [4]  inside the cylinder  [2] . Then the samples are isolated by pressing the disk  [5]  toward the 'O' ring  [12]  of the sample tray  [11] . The whole system is taken out of the glove box. The cylinder  [2]  fits exactly to the port of the microscope  [1] . It is pressed toward the 'O' ring  [3] . The whole system is evacuated and reaches a pressure of about 10 -~ torr. The disk  [5]  is lifted by screwing the bolts  [10] . The sample tray  [11]  is moved with the manipulator  [13]  inside the microscope, where the pressure is about 10 -6 torr. Using this method, the lithium samples are exposed only to the glove box atmosphere and to a vacuum of about 10-~-10 -6 torr. I / Fig.  3 .

Results and Discussion
Uncontaminated LiCl04 solutions.--Figure  4  shows a typical SEM micrograph of a smooth, mirror-like lithium surface which was prepared by shearing off the surface layer (scraping it with a stainless steel knife), followed by smoothing (rolling it with a clean glass tube). Figure  5  shows SEM micrographs obtained from Li surfaces on which lithium was galvanostatically deposited from LiClO4 solutions of THF, PC, and B L (5a, 5b, and 5c, respectively). Single dendrites at higher magnification are shown in Fig.  6a  and 6b (obtained from PC and BL/LiC104 solutions, respectively). These micrographs show typical locations of dendrite formation (along cracks or stress lines). Also, the dendrites, as shown, have a lot of narrow regions (bottlenecks) where corrosion or mechanical shock can easily disconnect them from the bulk. We carried out a series of experiments in which Li electrodes were charged (Li deposition); followed by consecutive discharge (Li dissolution) in the various systems. The charge involved in the anodic process was in excess of 10% of the cathodic one. In all cases, the dissolution process leaves m a n y dendrites untouched, and holes are formed. In other experiments, Li electrodes were cycled 5-30 times, followed by prolonged dissolution (twice the charge involved in a single half cycle) as a final process. SEM studies of these electrodes show that the density and average size of the dendrites left increase as a function of n u m b e r of cycles. Table  I  summarizes the data obtained from the cycling efficiency m e a s u r e m e n t s of Li electrodes in the various systems. All the LiC104 salt solutions studied in this work have quite a poor lithium cycling efficiency. It should be noticed that the values of Table I are s o m e w h a t lower than cycling efficiency values of same solvents that appear in the literature  (20) (21) (22) . There are two major reasons for these differences: 1. The values of Table  I  were obtained from experiments in which lithium was deposited on nickel or copper substrates. Naturally, lithium deposition on a lithium substrate is expected to have a higher efficiency, since adherence of Li deposits to lithium substrate is better  (23) . 2. We found that in several solvent systems, cycling efficiency increases as electrolyte concentration increases  (24) . A m a x i m u m cycling efficiency of lithium electrode in PC-LiC104 was achieved at salt concentration around 1M (2O). In the present work, salt concentration in most of the experiments was around 0.5M, which is somewhat lower than the electrolyte concentrations where m a x i m a in cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes are achieved  (20, 21, 23) . The poor lithium cycling efficiency obtained in the three solvent systems (which correlate nicely with the SEM studies indicating massive dendrite formation during Li deposition) should be discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in these solvents ob- tained by the F T I R measurements. It is generally accepted that the electrochemical behavior of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic solvents is surface films-controlled  (5, 6) . Since the resistance of these films to lithium cation transport is the main activation barrier to the electrochemical deposition or dissolution of lithium, the effectiveness and uniformity of Li cation passage through these films are the key factors which determine the cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes. The transport of lithium cations through these films obviously depends on the different lithium-containing functional groups of the organic and inorganic molecules which build the films. These functional groups include alkyl carbonate (ROCO2Li) and inorganic carbonate Li2CO3 in the case of PC (  12 ), organic carboxylate (R-COOLi), alkoxy (R-O-Li), and ~-keto ester anion in the case T h e ethers, w h i c h are far less reactive to l i t h i u m t h a n B L or PC, are e x p e c t e d to form t h e m o s t u n i f o r m films. However, this relative u n r e a c t i v i t      consecutive dissolution, as shown in Fig.  9c  (obtained from lithium electrode on which lithium was deposited and consecutively dissolved in O2-saturated LiC104-BL solution). Similar behavior was also observed with lithium electrodes cycled several times in O2-saturated BL-LiC104 solutions followed by prolonged dissolution as the final step.

The reaction between lithium and oxygen may l~orm several oxides, including Li20, Li202 (peroxide), and LiQ-(superoxide). All of them are expected to be strong nucleophiles that can further react with the organic solvents. Indeed, in a previous work we found that lithium oxides nu- cleophilically react with BL to form derivatives of -/-hydroxy butyric acid  (11) . In the present work, it was found that PC is also nuc]eophilically attacked by oxides to form opened chain ROCO2-compounds (monoalkyl-carbonate anion). Figure  10  shows a FTIR spectrum obtained from superoxide (KO2.) which was in contact with PC for 24h, followed by drying and pelletizing with KBr. This spectrum is typical of monoalkylcarbonate anion-alkaline metal salts. [ROCO2-M +, M = Li, K,  (12, 25) , major peak assignments are also indicated in the figure .] Similar experiments with Li20 also produced spectra which are typical of ROCO2Li compounds. These compounds, having strong carbonyl absorptions in the IR around 1650cm -1 and 1350-1300 cm -l, are also major components in surface films formed on lithium in pure PC  (12) . These results show that PC reacts with oxides to form a bifunctional organic compound containing both OCO2-(carbonate anion) and C-4) (alkoxy groups). In this manner, PC resembles BL. THF, however, does not seem to react with lithium oxides. Since PC, BL, and ethers all react with lithium  (11) (12) (13) , and the saturation concentration of oxygen in these solvents is about 10 ~-10-4M  (26) , it is questionable as to what degree oxygen dissolved in these solvents influences the surface chemistry of lithium in these systems. We conducted a series of experiments in which identi-calJy pretreated lithium samples [pretreatment is described in Ref.  (12) ] were exposed for the same period of time to pure and oxygen-saturated solvents. The samples were all analyzed identically by surface-sensitive FTIR [protected with KBr plate, external reflectance mode  (11, 12) ]. Figure  lla  shows a typical FTIR spectrum obtained from lithium surface exposed for two weeks to pure THF. The spectrum is typical of an alkoxide film [usually formed Figure  12  shows two typical FTIR spectra obtained from lithium surfaces treated in pure and O2-saturated PC [6.6 9 10-4M 02  (26) ]. Both spectra show the typical peaks of ROCO2Li compounds, but the spectra obtained from lithium treated in O2-saturated PC have much more intense IR bands than the samples which were identically treated in pure PC. Surface films formed on lithium in pure or oxygensaturated BL both have pronounced carboxylate (CO2-) IR peaks around 1580 cm -~ and 1440 cm 1. However, FTIR spectra obtained from lithium samples treated in O2-saturated BL have much stronger carboxylate peaks compared to samples treated identically in pure BL. In both cases, the reaction of the solvent with oxide films, if formed, produces species which are similar to those formed by direct reduction of the pure solvent by lithium. Therefore the presence of oxygen in solutions is not expected to change the main features in the IR spectra. However, the 02 effect on the intensity of the absorption bands is significant. All the above results point to the conclusion that 02 modifies the surface chemistry of lithium in all the above solvents. In spite of the low saturation concentration [10 ~-10-4M (  26 )], dissolved oxygen seems to react with lithium faster than the solvents. Thus, an oxide layer is formed on the lithium surface. In the case of ethereal systems, the oxide film suppresses solvent reduction and no secondary film is formed. In cases of electrophilic solvents such as PC or BL, the primary oxide film reacts nucleophilically with the solvents to form a secondary film on top of the oxide layer. Naturally, one would attribute the pronounced increase in intensity of IR bands of the surface films formed on lithium in the presence of oxygen to an increase in thickness. However, the lower overpotential required for electrochemical deposition and dissolution of lithium when 02 is present as compared to uncontaminated solutions, seems to indicate that the oxygen-originated films are much thinner than those formed naturally by solvent reduction. Therefore, the 'intensity effect' mentioned above should be attributed to changes in the optical properties of the reflective metal-surface film systems, rather than to increase of thickness. In the case of PC and THF, the oxygen-related films are probably more uniform than those formed in pure solvents, and therefore less dendrites are formed by lithium deposition in O2-contaminated systems. In the case of BL   (11) . Dissolved w a t e r reacts w i t h l i t h i u m to form LiOH, w h i c h f u r t h e r nucleophilically attacks t h e solvent to form a s e c o n d a r y film of b u t y r a t e on top of the h y d r o xide. In this m a n n e r , t h e p r e s e n c e of w a t e r in B L leads to a m o d i f i c a t i o n of t h e surface films f o r m e d on l i t h i u m similar to t h e case of o x y g e n d i s c u s s e d above. Therefore, as s h o w n in Table  I , t h e p r e s e n c e of w a t e r in B L slightly improves t h e poor cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in t h e B L solutions a n d r e d u c e s t h e overpotential r e q u i r e d for Li d e p o s i t i o n a n d dissolution.

At lower w a t e r conc e n t r a t i o n (0.005M a n d below), we could also detect t h e p r e s e n c e of alkoxides on l i t h i u m surfaces e x p o s e d to T H F solutions.

Hardly any dendrites are formed during lithium deposition in LiAsF6 solutions. The morphology studies are consistent with the cycling efficiency measurements.

n s t r a t e s t h a t l i t h i u m deposition in LiAsF6 solutions is m u c h s m o o t h e r t h a n in LiC104. T h e s e electrolyte effects
As shown in Table  I , lithium electrodes in LiAsF6 solutions have much higher cycling efficiency than in LiC10, solutions. Such a salt effect in ethers and PC was also observed by others  (28) . We studied salt reduction processes on Li electrodes in these solvents using XPS  (12, 13) , AES  (29) , SIMS  (13) , and x-ray microanalysis  (23, 24) . LiC1 was always detected on Li surfaces treated with LiC104 solutions. XPS measurements by us and others indicate that other chlorine compounds such as LiC103 may also be formed and precipitate on Li surfaces in LiC104 solutions  (12, 13, 30) . LiF is always detected on lithium electrodes in LiAsF6 solutions. The FTIR measurements indicate that the nature of the salt does not change the surface chemistry of the organic films. Therefore, the pronounced salt effect on surface morphology and cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes may be related to the difference in the lithium halides, which precipitate on the lithium surfaces due to salt reduction. In the case of LiC104 reduction, precipitation of more than a single type of chloride on the surface, and the size of the chloride anions, may distort homogeneous precipitation of the organic films. Thus, perhaps increasing the nonuniformity of the organic surface films increases the intensity of dendrite formation, and therefore influences cycling efficiency detrimentally. LiAsF6 reduction precipitates only a single compound, LiF, on the surface. The fluoride anion is smaller than chloride, and therefore, LiF precipitation probably interferes far less with the uniformity of the organic surface films, compared to LiC1.

Conclusion
Li electrodes have low cycling efficiency in pure LiC104 solutions of PC, BL, and THF. [This correlates with surface morphology studies (SEM) which indicate dendritic deposition of lithium in these solutions.] The poor performance is understood in light of the complicated surface chemistry of lithium in these systems, which leads to a disordered precipitation of multi-functional organic surface species, together with insoluble lithium-chlorine salts. Nevertheless, one should not give up the possibility of utilizing LiC104 solutions of PC or BL in secondary lithium batteries, since these systems are much less toxic, volatile, and resistant, compared to LiAsF~ solutions of cyclic ethers (e.g., 1-3 dioxolane, 2-methyl THF) where much higher Li cycling efficiency is obtained. This work proves that surface modification of Li in the active solvents, by the use of chemicals which form better passive films, indeed considerably improves the performance of Li elec-trodes in these systems. Thus, our results should encourage the use of active additives in electrolyte systems for secondary Li batteries as one of the preferred solutions for the problem of Li cycling efficiency in polar aprotic solvents.
