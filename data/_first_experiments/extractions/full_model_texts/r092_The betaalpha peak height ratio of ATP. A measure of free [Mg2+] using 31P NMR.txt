Intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] and [H ϩ ] interact with numerous metabolites to alter the extent and direction of many of the key reactions of energy metabolism 
(1, 2)  including the ⌬G of ATP hydrolysis, the [PCr]/[ATP] ratio and hence the inferred free cytosolic [ADP]  (3, 4) , key steps in glycolysis and the tricarboxcylic acid cycle  (5, 6)  and the kinetics of a number of plasma membrane ion channels  (7) . Despite its importance in both energetics and kinetics, there has been no generally accepted method for estimation of intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] (8). Next to potassium, total magnesium is the most abundant of the intracellular cations, being about 6 -7 mol/g of wet weight in brain and perfused rat heart, 8 in kidney, and 10 in liver. The intracellular magnesium is, however, largely bound. Scatchard plot analysis of intracellular contents showed that Mg 2ϩ binds to 2-3 mol/g of wet weight of insoluble nucleic acid binding sites with a K B of 3,700 M Ϫ1 , 5-10 mol/g soluble protein binding sites with an apparent K B of 530 M Ϫ1 and to a variety of intracellular phosphorylated and polycarboxylic acid metabolites  (9) . Using the appropriate amount of binding agents, their binding constants and knowing the amount of total magnesium present, the free intracellular [Mg 2ϩ ] has been calculated to be in the range of 0.5 to 1.3 mM in most cell types  (9) , save the red cell, where it has been estimated to be in the range of 0.15 to 0.25 mM  (10, 11) . In plasma, in addition to phosphate and carbonate, magnesium binds to serum proteins and some metabolites so that free [Mg 2ϩ ] is estimated to be about 0.5 mM  (12) , or essentially the same as intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] in spite of the negative electric potential of the intracellular, relative to the extracellular, phase of cells and in marked contrast to the large gradient of free [Ca 2ϩ ] existing between extra-and intracellular phases  (13) . Estimation of intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] has been attempted by measuring the ratio of [products]/[reactants] whose binding constants for Mg 2ϩ are very different, such as myokinase (EC 2.7.4.3) (10) or aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3)  (9) . In tissues containing mitochondria, where there is significant compartmentation of ADP (3), use of the metabolite ratio of the myokinase reaction is unsuitable, but changes induced by alteration of free [Mg 2ϩ ] in the equilibrium ratio of [citrate]/[isocitrate] agreed well with the estimation of free [Mg 2ϩ ] by other means  (9) . Supporting the role of intracellular citrate as a natural indicator of free [Mg 2ϩ ] was the observation that the chemical shift of the citrate resonance in 13 C NMR spectra of rat liver perfused with acetate, gave a free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 0.46 mM  (14) . However, citrate levels in most normal tissues are below the sensitivity of 13  31 P (15) and combined 1 H, 31 P NMR  (16, 17)  studies of the effects of Mg 2ϩ on ATP have shown that Mg 2ϩ induces the greatest chemical shift of the ␤ and the least on the ␣ resonance at physiological pH. These findings have been interpreted as indicating that Mg 2ϩ binds mainly to the ␤ and ␥ phosphorus residues, but not the ␣ residue (15, 17) (Fig.  1 ). Subsequently, measurement of the difference of the chemical shift of the ␤ from the ␣ resonance of ATP, ␦ ␣␤ , became the dominant method for determination of intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] in red cell, muscle  (18 -20) , liver  (21) , and kidney  (22) . The formalism applied in this method, however, contains an apparent binding con-stant and maximum chemical shifts for a mixture of ionic species of ATP for Mg 2ϩ at a defined pH  (23) . While attempts have been made to correct mathematically this apparent binding constant for the effects of variations in intracellular pH (8,  24) , no actual calibration of the characteristics of 31 P NMR spectra of defined ionic species of binding ligands under defined conditions of pH, free [Mg 2ϩ ], temperature of 38 °C, and ionic strength of 0.25 have been made. We have chosen to analyze the observed changes in peak height ratio and chemical shift difference in the 31 P NMR spectra of ATP in terms of its known acid and Mg 2ϩ dissociation constants. Because of the difficulty in determining free [Mg 2ϩ ] in tissue  (25, 26)  and the fundamental  (6)  and clinical importance of free [Mg 2ϩ ] (27-33), we have attempted to determine if 31 P spectral analysis can serve as an adequate indicator of intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] in intact tissue. We have measured the ␦ ␣␤ of ATP and ␦ P i in vitro under intracellular conditions in solutions containing 5 mM each of ATP, PCr, Glu-6-P, and P i while at the same time observing other pertinent 31 P NMR spectral characteristics such as line width and peak heights as a function of changing pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ]. We have applied this analysis to 31 P NMR spectra of the working rat heart perfused with two different substrate combinations and compared the results with estimates of free [Mg 2ϩ ] determined using the [citrate]/[isocitrate] ratio.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Solutions-Solutions were prepared containing 5 mM each of K 2 ATP, Na 2 PCr, K 2 Glc-6-P (Sigma), and KH 2 PO 4 (British Drug House, Poole, UK) at 38 °C, I ϭ 0.25. The pH of the solutions ranged from 5.75 to 8.5, and the total magnesium ranged from 0 to 12.2 mM. Ionic strength was adjusted to 0.25 by adding KCl and the pH was adjusted using KOH or HCl to give a set of 77 samples from pH 5.75 to 8.5 at each free [Mg 2ϩ ] concentration (Table  I ). Known acid dissociation constants, K a , and Mg 2ϩ binding constants for each particular ionic species, K B , were adjusted to 38 °C and an ionic strength of 0.25  (6) . Defining the ionic species of Mg 2ϩ binding ligands, A zϪ , present in each solution gave a statement from which the amount of total MgCl 2 , [Mg Tot ], to be added to give the desired free [Mg 2ϩ ] could be calculated: ͓Mg Tot ͔ ϭ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ͫ 1 ϩ i ͩ ͓A Tot ͔ i ϫ K Bi fA i ͪͬ (Eq. 1) where f is a ratio of the ionized ligand, A zϪ , to the total ligand, A Tot ϫ fA i ϭ [A Tot i ]/[A zϪ ]. For ligands with multiple magnesium binding states such as ATP 4Ϫ and HATP 3Ϫ , the formalism is somewhat more complex than single binding ligands  (6, 34) . [Mg Tot ] to be added to give the desired free [Mg 2ϩ ] in the calibration solutions containing the four magnesium binding ligands, ATP, PCr, Glu-6-P, and P i may be estimated by: ͓Mg Tot ͔ ϭ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ϫ ΄1ϩ ͓P iTot ͔ ϫ K BPi fP i ϩ ͓ATP Tot ͔ ϫ ͩ K BATP 4Ϫ ϩ ͓H ϩ ͔ K aHATP 3Ϫ Ϫ K BHATP 3Ϫ ͪ fATP ϩ ͓PCr Tot ͔ ϫ K BPCr fPCr ϩ ͓G6P Tot ͔ ϫ K BG6P fG6P ΅ (Eq. 2) Solution of this formalism may be achieved using any suitable program for the evaluation of simultaneous equations  (35)  or with commercially available software (Mathematica, Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL)  (36) . By this method sufficient total magnesium was added to give solutions with free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, and 5 mM. 31 P NMR Spectroscopy-31 P NMR spectra of the 77 different calibration solutions at the various pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ] at 38 °C and I ϭ 0.25 were acquired using a 9.4-Tesla, Oxford Instrument 400 MHz wide-bore superconducting magnet interfaced with a Bruker Aspect 2000 spectrometer set at 161.9 MHz for phosphorus. The homogeneity of the magnetic field was optimized by shimming on the 1 H free induction decay providing line widths of 10 Ϯ 3 Hz. For each sample, a 90°pulse was used and eight averaged transients were collected with an acquisition time of 0.32 s (8K data points), a spectral width of 12.8 kHz, an interpulse delay of 30 s, and no proton decoupling. A capillary containing phenyl phosphonic acid was used as an external reference standard. Prior to Fourier transformation, the time domain signals were zero filled to 16K data points, providing 1.5 Hz resolution per point and an exponential filter was applied that produced 10 Hz line broadening and in perfused heart spectra, 20 Hz line broadening was used. The 31 P NMR spectral resonances were fitted to a Lorentzian line shape using the NMR1 program (Tripos, UK). This program determined the best fit base line, following which the chemical shifts, line widths, areas, and peak heights were determined. The ␦ P i observed by the 31 P NMR spectral analysis of the standard samples at each known free [Mg 2ϩ ] were fitted to equations using the nonlinear fit package in Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). Perfusion of Working Rat Hearts-Hearts from 450 -500-g fed, male Wistar rats were perfused in the working mode using modified Krebs Henseleit buffer containing 10 mM glucose as described previously  (37) . Hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode for 15 min, followed by a 15-min period of stabilization in the working mode and a 30 min period of perfusion at the end of which hearts were freeze clamped. The frozen tissue was extracted and assayed fluorometrically for contents of citrate and isocitrate  (38) . The intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH was determined simultaneously from ␦ P i and the 31 P spectral properties of ATP as described below. Using the pH estimated from this result, intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] was also estimated independently by enzymatic measurements of the [citrate]/[isocitrate] ratios in freeze clamped perfused hearts as described previously  (5, 6, 9) . [creatine], [citrate] and [isocitrate] were determined enzymatically from freeze-clamped heart  (37) . In a separate series, hearts were perfused as above in the 31 P NMR spectrometer, and the relevant spectral parameters were determined on the instrument described above using the same 20-mm broad band probe (Paul Morris Inc.). The temperature in the coil was maintained at 38 °C by a variable temperature unit controlled by the spectrometer. Fully relaxed spectra were obtained using a 90°(40 s) pulse with a 15-s interpulse delay. There was a time resolution of 15 min as 64 free induction decays were collected to make a fully relaxed spectrum. [P i ], [PCr], and [ATP] were determined by 31 P NMR spectra  (39) . Cytosolic free [⌺ADP] was calculated from the equilibrium constant, K CK , and the measured components of the creatine kinase reaction (EC 2.7.  3 ). The value of K CK was corrected for changes in free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH as described previously  (6) . 3.2) [⌺ADP] ϭ [⌺ATP][creatine]/K CK [⌺PCr][H ϩ ] (

RESULTS
Determination of Intracellular pH Using the P i -PCr Chemical Shift Difference, ␦ P i -The measured ␦ P i showed the extrapo- , and H 2 PO 4 Ϫ at pH Ͻ 5.75, ␦ H 2 PO 4 Ϫ in magnesium-free standard solutions to be 5.64 and 3.30 ppm, respectively (Fig.  2a ). The ␦ P i of the MgHPO 4 form, ␦ MgPO 4 , determined at pH 8.5 and free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 5 mM, was 5.59 ppm. Intracellular pH using 31 P NMR spectroscopy has been determined by the ␦ P i and applying the formalism  (40, 41) : pH ϭ pK aPi ϩ log ␦ Pi Ϫ ␦ H 2 PO 4 Ϫ ␦ HPO 4 2Ϫ Ϫ ␦ Pi (Eq. 3) However, it was previously predicted on theoretical grounds that pK ap i would decrease with increasing free [Mg 2ϩ ] (42) (Table  II ). Fitting the observed data (Fig.  2a ) for each concentration of free [Mg 2ϩ ] to Equation 3 confirmed that the apparent pK aP i decreased from 6.78 at free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 0 to 6.66 at free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 5 mM. This uncertainty in the estimation of intracellular pH using ␦ P i induced by changes in intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] was eliminated by modifying Equation 3 with statements defining the ionic species present and relating the observed chemical shifts to those species: ͓P iTot ͔ ϭ ͓HPO 4 2Ϫ ͔ ϩ ͓H 2 PO 4 Ϫ ͔ ϩ ͓MgHPO 4 ͔ , ␦ Pi ϭ ͓HPO 4 2Ϫ ͔ ͓P iTot ͔ ␦ HPO 4 2Ϫ ϩ ͓H 2 PO 4 Ϫ ͔ ͓P iTot ͔ ␦ H 2 PO 4 Ϫ ϩ ͓MgHPO 4 ͔ ͓P iTot ͔ ␦ MgHPO4 І pH ϭ pK aH 2 PO 4 Ϫ ϩ log ͑␦ Pi Ϫ␦ H 2 PO 4 Ϫ ͒ (␦ HPO 4 2Ϫ Ϫ ␦ Pi ) ϩ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K DMgHPO4 (␦ MgHPO4 Ϫ␦ Pi ) (Eq. 4) The values of ␦ H 2 PO 4 Ϫ, ␦ HPO 4 2Ϫ, and ␦ MgHPO 4 were taken from the observed data (Fig.  2a , see above). The pK aH 2 PO 4 Ϫ is the negative logarithm of the second acid dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, which was taken to be 6.77 from fitting the observed data (Fig.  2a ) for each concentration of free [Mg 2ϩ ] to Equations 4 to 5 (Table  II ). The K DMgHPO 4 was taken to be 13.4 mM (6). Equation 4 is similar to previous predictions  (43)  except that the MgH 2 PO 4 ϩ term is insignificant within the physiological range of pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ] and its inclusion is unnecessary. The theoretical surface predicted by Equation 4 (Fig.  2b ) accounts well for the plot of the observed data (Fig.  2a ).

Determination of Cytosolic Free [Mg 2ϩ
] Using the Chemical Shift Differences between the ␣-␤ Resonances of ATP, ␦ ␣␤ -The measured chemical shifts for HATP 3Ϫ , ␦ HATP 3Ϫ, and ATP 4Ϫ , ␦ ATP 4Ϫ, were determined in magnesium free standard solutions and found to be 11.35 and 10.6 ppm at pH 5.75 and 8.5, respectively. The chemical shift of the MgATP 2Ϫ form, ␦ MgATP 2Ϫ, determined at pH 8.5 and 5 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ], was 8.27 ppm. The plot of ␦ ␣␤ (Fig.  3a ) showed little change within the physiological range of pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ]. Large chemical shift changes occurred below 0.5 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ] and at pH Ͻ 7.0. Within the physiological range of free [Mg 2ϩ ] from 0.25 to 1.5 mM and pH of 7.0, the actual observed chemical shift difference between the ␣ and ␤ peaks of ATP, ␦ ␣␤ , decreased only 0.6 ppm or 7%. A formalism relating changes in free [Mg 2ϩ ] to ␦ ␣␤ , described previously  (18 -23) , was: ␦ ␣␤ ϭ ␦ ATP ϩ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K D⌺ATPapp ϫ ␦ MgATP 1 ϩ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K D⌺ATPapp (Eq. 5) where ␦ MgATP was 8.27 ppm, ␦ ATP was 10.81 ppm, and K D⌺ATP app was 0.05 mM at pH 7.3, 37 °C  (22) . Equation  5 was modified in a manner similar to the derivation of Equation 4 from Equation  3 to yield a statement (Equation  6 and Fig.  3c ) relating the chemical shift of the ␣ and ␤ peak of ATP to both free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH: ͓ATP Tot ͔ ϭ ͓ATP 4Ϫ ͔ ϩ ͓HATP 3Ϫ ͔ ϩ ͓MgATP 2Ϫ ͔ ␦ ␣␤ ϭ ͓ATP 4Ϫ ͔ ͓ATP Tot ͔ ␦ ATP 3Ϫ ϩ ͓HATP 3Ϫ ͔ ͓ATP Tot ͔ ␦ HATP 3Ϫ ϩ ͓MgATP 2Ϫ ͔ ͓ATP Tot ͔ ␦ MgATP 2Ϫ І␦ ␣␤ ϭ ␦ ATP 4Ϫ ϩ ␦ HATP 3Ϫ ϫ 10 ͑pKaHATP3ϪϪpH) ϩ␦ MgATP 2Ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K DMgATP 2Ϫ 1 ϩ 10 ͑pKaHATP3ϪϪpH͒ ϩ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K DMgATP 2Ϫ (Eq. 6) where ␦ MgATP 2Ϫ, ␦ ATP 4Ϫ, and ␦ HATP 3Ϫ and were taken from the observed data (see above). pK aHATP 3Ϫ was taken to be 6.50 at 38 °C, I ϭ 0.25, and 0 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ] (6), and K DMgATP 2Ϫ is K D of MgATP 2Ϫ at I ϭ 0.25, 38 °C, which was taken to be 0.106 mM  (6, 44) . The theoretical surface (Fig.  3c ) described by Equation  6 incorporates a free [Mg 2ϩ ] term, a pH term, and the Mg 2ϩ dissociation constant for a defined ionic species of ATP. This curve is very slightly higher than the empirically measured data (Fig.  3a ), but can be made superimposable by multiplying K DMgATP 2Ϫ by 0.6. The MgHATP Ϫ and Mg 2 ATP terms were ignored because of their low concentrations under these conditions.

Determination of Cytosolic Free [Mg 2ϩ
] with Change in the Peak Height Ratio of the ␤/␣ Resonances of ATP, h ␤/␣ -It was observed that the peak heights of both the ␤ and ␥ 31 P NMR resonances of ATP changed as free [Mg 2ϩ ] was varied while the peak height of the ␣ resonance remained constant (Fig.  4 ). In the area encompassed by pH 7.0 -7.3 and free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 0.25-1.5 mM, the ratio of the peak heights of the ␤/␣ resonances varied 2.5-fold from 0.30 to about 0.75 (Fig.  5a ). Two maxima, h ␤/␣max , were observed, about 0.9, at the extremes of free [Mg 2ϩ ] examined and minima were observed, 0.1 to 0.4, at 0.25 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ], the experimental point closest to K DMgATP 2Ϫ. The plot of the surface of the observed h ␤/␣ (Fig.  5a ) at free [Mg 2ϩ ] at or above 0.25 mM and all pH values from 5.75 to 8.5 could be simulated (Fig.  5c ) by the formalism derived from the acid dissociation constants and the Mg 2ϩ binding constants for ATP: h ␤/␣ ϭ h ␤/␣Max ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͩ 1 ϩ 2.5 ϫ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͪ (Eq. 7a) At free [Mg 2ϩ ] Ͻ 0.25 mM h ␤/␣ ϭ h ␤/␣Max ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ) ͩ 1 ϩ 2.5 ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͪ ͑Eq. 7b) The pK a of the ␣ phosphate was taken to be 3.75, pK a3 of H 2 ATP 2Ϫ  (6) . The apparent acid dissociation constant of HATP 3Ϫ , pK a4 , determined by taking the first derivative of the line describing the change in the chemical shift differences from PCr to ␤ATP with pH at 0 free [Mg 2ϩ ] gave a pK a4 of 6.71 from the ␤ phosphorus of HATP 3Ϫ . This value, while somewhat higher, is within experimental error of the pK a4 of HATP 3Ϫ of 6.50 obtained titrametrically and corrected to the desired temperature and ionic strength  (6) . The factor of 2.5 was estimated from the measured ␥/␤ peak height ratio, h ␥/␤ , at 0.25 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ] and represents the greater chemical shift difference and hence broadening of the ␤ relative to the ␣ or ␥ phosphorus resonances. Because changes in free [Mg 2ϩ ] can affect the observed ␦ P i used to estimate intracellular pH, the estimation of either pH or free [Mg 2ϩ ] requires that Equations 4 and 7 be solved simultaneously. Since pK a3 is about 3 orders of magnitude below intracellular pH, the term (1 ϩ 10 pKa3ϪpH ) in Equation  7 can be taken to be 1, and Equation 7a simplified to: ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ϭ 2.5 ϫ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ϫ h ␤/␣ h ␤/␣Max Ϫ h ␤/␣ (Eq. 7c) It should be noted however, that when the observed h ␤/␣ approaches 0.8, the free [Mg 2ϩ ] becomes indeterminate other than to say it is Ͼ 1.5 mM and cannot be estimated from this measurement (see Fig.  5c ). While changes in the ␤/␣ peak height ratio appear to be greater within the physiologically normal range of free [Mg 2ϩ ] from 0.25 to 1.5 mM, the ␥/␣ peak height ratio, h ␥/␣ , also described changes in free [Mg 2ϩ ], but only within an acidotic pH range of 5.75-7.0 and a range of free [Mg 2ϩ ] from 0.25-0.75 mM where the h ␥/␣ decreased precipitously from 0.96 to 0.2 (Fig.  6a ). These levels of pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ] are generally below those encountered in normal tissue. Nevertheless, the behavior of the ␥/␣ peak height ratio with changes in pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ] can be described by an equation derived from acid and Mg dissociation constants of the same form as Equation 8 h ␥/␣ ϭ h ␥/␣Max ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͩ 1 ϩ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͪ (Eq. 8) Where pK a4 ϭ 6. using ␦ P i and Equation 7c using h ␤/␣ , was 1.0 Ϯ 0.1 mM and 7.03 Ϯ 0.01 (Table  III ). In contrast, the free [Mg 2ϩ ] estimated from the measured ␦ ␣␤ using Equation  5    significantly changed from hearts perfused with glucose alone at 0.46 Ϯ 0.04 mM (Table  III ). In the glucose perfused hearts, K CK (Table  III ) was 1.65 ϫ 10 9 M when free [Mg 2ϩ ] was estimated by h ␤/␣ , but significantly decreased to 1.27 ϫ 10 9 M when free [Mg 2ϩ ] was estimated by ␦ ␣␤ . As a result of this variation, the free cytosolic [⌺ADP] was 0.172 Ϯ 0.012 when calculated using the h ␤/␣ estimate of [Mg 2ϩ ], but was significantly elevated to 0.223 Ϯ 0.015 mM when estimated using the ␦ ␣␤ result. In hearts perfused with glucose and ketones, variation in estimated free [Mg 2ϩ ] also significantly altered K CK . DISCUSSION 31 P NMR spectroscopy provides a method for determination of intracellular pH in intact tissues. Small changes in pH are thought to result from the action of a number of important hormones  (45)  and a number of pathological states. Precise determination of cytosolic pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ] (  6 ) is required to evaluate the pH gradient and electrical potential between mitochondria and cytosol and the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP  (39) . Alterations in tissue magnesium content is thought to occur in a majority of patients in intensive care units  (32)  and to play an etiological role in hypertension, arteriosclerosis, certain severe cardiac arrhythmias  (31) , malnutrition, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome  (27) . Alterations in free [Mg 2ϩ ] have been shown experimentally to have widespread effects on the reactions of energy metabolism and on the kinetics of ion channels  (7) . However, evaluation of intracellular [Mg 2ϩ ] has been difficult. Here we present evidence that measurement of the ␤/␣ peak height ratio of ATP in 31 P NMR can give an accurate estimate of the free [Mg 2ϩ ] in tissue in a noninvasive manner. The measured ␦ HPO 4 2Ϫ Ϫ ␦ H 2 PO 4 Ϫ (Fig.  2a ) of 2.34 ppm is similar to that reported by Bailey et al.  (41)  of 2.42 ppm. Previous attempts to measure pH from ␦ P i using a pK a apparent for inorganic phosphate (Equation  3 ) agreed within 0.1 pH units with estimates of intracellular pH using measurements of tissue contents of bicarbonate and CO 2  (46) . Solving simulta-neously the new formalism for cytosolic pH (Equations 4 and 7a), using a pK aH 2 PO 4 Ϫ of 6.77, the ␦ P i and the observed h ␤/␣ (Equation 7a) gave cytosolic pH values of 7.03 in glucoseperfused hearts. While the true pK aH 2 PO 4 Ϫ remained constant, the apparent pK aP i (Equation  3 ) varied with changing [Mg 2ϩ ], with its maximum deviation observed at the highest [Mg 2ϩ ] examined. Previous estimates of pK aH 2 PO 4 Ϫ at 25 °C and various ionic strengths ranged from 6.78 at I ϭ 0.2 (34, 47) to 7.206 at I ϭ 0 and 0 free [Mg 2ϩ ] (48). At physiological ionic strength and temperature the value has been estimated to be 6.71 (6) or 6.75  (42) . From the curve fitting routine using Equation 3 in the absence of free [Mg 2ϩ ], the point of maximum value of d␦ P i /dpH identifies the pH where the ratio of [H 2 PO 4  Ϫ ]/[HPO 4 2Ϫ ] is 1. The pH at that point is equivalent to the negative log of the acid dissociation constant. When free [Mg 2ϩ ] is present in the solution, the maximum value of d␦ P i /dpH no longer identifies the pH where [H 2 PO 4  Ϫ ]/[HPO 4 2Ϫ ] is 1, and therefore does not identify the true acid dissociation constant. We set the value of Equation 4 to that obtained with ␦ P i and solved for pK aH 2 PO 4 Ϫ as the unknown. We obtained an essentially invariant acid dissociation constant in the range of free [Mg 2ϩ ] from 0 to 5 mM. On the other hand when we applied this method to Equation 3 which does not have free [Mg 2ϩ ] term, we obtained variable constants depending on the free [Mg 2ϩ ] because this number is not a true acid dissociation constant. It follows that a precise determination of intracellular pH from ␦ P i requires knowledge of the free [Mg 2ϩ ]. Use of Equation 3 to determine cytosolic pH yielded pH values which were 0.02-0.04 pH units higher than the values obtained by the simultaneous solution of Equations 4 and 7. ␦ ␣␤ has previously been used for determination of free [Mg 2ϩ ] (18 -23). However, Equation  5 does not account for chemical shift changes with pH of the ␣ and ␤ peaks of the complexed, ␦ MgATP , and uncomplexed ␦ ATP , forms of ATP, or in the apparent binding constant for all the ionic species of ATP,⌺ATP. In our study the ␦ ␣␤ at pH 7.3 and [Mg 2ϩ ] ϭ 0 was 10.77, similar to 10.81 previously reported  (22) . These values result from contributions of both ATP 4Ϫ and HATP 3Ϫ and therefore may not be used as the chemical shift limit for ATP 4Ϫ . The proper formalism relating ␦ ␣␤ to free [Mg 2ϩ ] (Equation  6 ) uses defined acid and magnesium dissociation constants for the ionic species involved. However, Fig.  3 , a and b, shows that the changes observed in ␦ ␣␤ were very small within the normal intracellular range of free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH, and occur mainly below 0.5 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ]. In this study, we show the ability of changes in free [Mg 2ϩ ] to alter both the chemical shift differences and the peak heights the ␤ and ␥, but not the ␣ resonances of ATP (Figs.  3  and 5 ). At pH between 7.0 and 7.3, raising the free [Mg 2ϩ ] from 0.25 to about 1.0 mM increased the chemical shift differences between PCr and the ␣ resonance of ATP by 0.06 ppm, ␤ by 0.40 ppm, and ␥ by 0.39 ppm. 31 P NMR chemical shifts are generally neither sensitive nor specific enough to specify binding sites of a metal ion (16) with certainty. There remains uncertainty about the meaning to the greater chemical shift in the ␤ resonance of ATP with [Mg 2ϩ ] (16). However, our ability to duplicate the changes in the 31 P NMR spectra of ATP using simple binding and acid dissociation constants leads us to confirm, that within usual physiological concentrations of ATP, free Mg 2ϩ and pH, binding of Mg 2ϩ occurs predominantly at the ␤ and ␥ phosphorus resonances of ATP but not to the ␣ resonance (15, 17) (Fig.  1 ). Under the physiological conditions examined, ATP Tot consisted principally of the species ATP 4Ϫ , MgATP 2Ϫ , and HATP 3Ϫ . At 0 free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH 5.75, HATP 3Ϫ is the predominant species and the chemical shift of the 31 P NMR spec- In the range of 0.25 to 5 mM free [Mg 2ϩ ], the ratio of ␤ or ␥ to ␣ peak height represents the ratio of the number of magnesium-bound ␤ or ␥ phosphorus to the number of the nonprotonated ␣ phosphorus residues of ATP. In the range of 0 -0.25 of free [Mg 2ϩ ], this ratio represents the number of the nonprotonated and non-magnesium-bound ␤ or ␥ phosphorus to the nonprotonated ␣ phosphorus nuclei of ATP. Therefore when [Mg 2ϩ ] is above K D : h ␤/␣ ϭ h ␤/␣Max ϫ MgP ␤ P ␣ Ϫ (Eq. 9) where P ␣ Ϫ is the unprotonated ␣ phosphate of ATP and MgP ␤ is the magnesium complex of the ␤ phosphorus of ATP. The  where HP ␣ is the protonated ␣ phosphate of ATP, and P ␤ Ϫ and HP ␤ are the unprotonated and protonated ␤ phosphate of ATP. From Equation  10 , using the K a values of ATP and the K D of MgATP 2Ϫ , we may write: P ␣ Ϫ ϩ HP ␣ ϭ P ␣ Ϫ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ P ␤ Ϫ ϩ HP ␤ ϩ MgP ␤ ϭ MgP ␤ ϫ ͩ 1 ϩ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͪ І MgP ␤ P ␣ Ϫ ϭ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͩ 1 ϩ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ ϫ ͑1 ϩ 10 pKa4ϪpH ͒ ͪ (Eq. 11) Equation 7a was obtained from Equation 11 by multiplying K DMgATP 2Ϫ/[Mg 2ϩ ] by 2.5, the observed ratio of the ␥/␤ peak heights of ATP near K DMgATP 2Ϫ and pH 8.5. This factor appears to be related to the greater chemical shift difference of the ␤ peak of 2.76 ppm relative to that of ␣ and ␥, which were 0.43 and 0.59 ppm, respectively. Because the chemical shift differences with free [Mg 2ϩ ] of ␣ or the ␥ resonances of unprotonated ATP were quite similar, the sensitivity of h ␤/␣ was taken to be similar to that observed in h ␥/␤ . For the same reasons, inclusion of such a factor is not required in the derivation of the formalism which describes the changes in the h ␥/␣ with free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH (Equation  8 ), because their shift differences are roughly similar. The h ␤/␣ was however more sensitive within the physiological range because the ␦ ␣␤ was three times that of ␦ ␣␥ enhancing the broadening of the ␤ peak and hence causing a greater diminution of its height. Under conditions where [Mg 2ϩ ] is less than 0.25 mM, the concentration closest to K D tested in this study, the ATP 4Ϫ species was used for both phosphorus nuclei (Equation  1b ). Since the ␤/␣ ratio approached 1, this indicated that protonation of ATP 4Ϫ to HATP 3Ϫ had little effect on the h ␤/␣ . In contrast, addition of Mg 2ϩ at any pH had a large effect on h ␤/␣ (Fig.  4 ). We incorporated this observation into Equation 7b in the statement HP ␤ ϭ P ␤ Ϫ ϫ ͓Mg 2ϩ ͔ K DMgATP 2Ϫ ͓HATP 3Ϫ ͔ (Eq. 12) The peak height of the ␤ resonance of ATP was maximal at 0 and saturating free [Mg 2ϩ ] and decreased at intermediate free [Mg 2ϩ ], while the ␣ resonance of ATP was essentially invariant, as had been observed previously  (18) . What was not previously known was the formalism relating this decrease in peak height to free [Mg 2ϩ ] and that this variation in ␤/␣ peak height would occur within the range of the physiological intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] of 0.25 to 1.5 mM  (9) . In attempting to use the measured h ␤/␣ to estimate free [Mg 2ϩ ] it is essential that care be taken in determining the position of the base line under the ␤ and ␣ peaks of ATP in order to obtain an accurate measurement of peak height. When the measured ␤/␣ peak height ratio approaches the h ␤/␣Max of about 0.90, the calculation of free [Mg 2ϩ ] using Equation 8 becomes indeterminate except to conclude that it is Ͼ1.5 mM (Fig.  3a ). Likewise, when the concentration of free [Mg 2ϩ ] falls below 0.25 mM, approaching the K D of MgATP 2Ϫ of 0.1 mM, the estimation of free [Mg 2ϩ ] by this method would become indeterminate.   8 ) as that describing changes in h ␤/␣ which is derived from known acid and magnesium dissociation constants and a statement of the ionic forms present in the solution.

Variation in perfused heart free cytosolic [Mg 2ϩ ] using chemical shift or peak height ratios of ATP Cytosolic free [Mg 2ϩ ] in working rat hearts was evaluated using two methods: measurement of h ␤/␣ and ␦ ␣␤ , and given as means Ϯ standard error of the mean with the number observations given in (). *indicates a significant difference of the means of the h ␤/␣ and ␦ ␣␤ groups at p Ͻ 0.05 as judged by the Mann-Whitney U test.

Glucose  (6)  Glucose ϩ ketones (4) The value of the apparent equilibrium constants of a number of important intracellular reactions change with both pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ]. In particular free cytosolic [⌺ADP] has been estimated from the measured components of the creatine kinase reaction  (3, 4, 49, 50) , particularly in studies attempting to determine the factors controlling O 2 consumption in intact tissues  (39)  or to explain variations in [⌺PCr]/[⌺ATP] ratios observed by 31 PNMR spectroscopy of human subjects (4) in various physiological states. The apparent equilibrium constant of the creatine kinase reaction: and the value of K CK Ј at pH 7.0, free [Mg 2ϩ ] ϭ 1 mM, I ϭ 0.25 and T ϭ 38 °C is 166 (1). This value has been confirmed to within about 5%  (36, 51) . It is not widely appreciated, however, that without accurate assessment of both cytosolic pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ], the estimation of cytosolic [⌺ADP] may be significantly in error (Table  III ). Determination of both pH and free [Mg 2ϩ ] from ␦ P i and h ␤/␣ by the simultaneous solution of Equations 5 and 8 not only improves the estimation of both cytosolic free [Mg 2ϩ ] and pH, but also the estimation of cytosolic free  [⌺ADP] . h K CK ϭ ͓⌺ATP͔͓Creatine͔ ͓⌺ADP͔͓⌺PCr͔ ϭ K ionic ͓H ϩ ͔ The use of h ␤/␣ to determine intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] has advantages over the measurement of the [citrate]/[isocitrate] ratio or the measurement of ␦ ␣␤ . First, use of metabolite ratios requires tissue destruction and the enzymatic measurement of isocitrate is technically difficult. Secondly estimation of the [citrate]/[isocitrate] ratio can give spurious estimates of the cytosolic free [Mg 2ϩ ] because of intraorganelle compartmentation of metabolite or of Mg 2ϩ or because of a failure of aconitase to achieve near-equilibrium. Measurement of ␦ ␣␤ for the determination of intracellular free [Mg 2ϩ ] is limited primarily by its lack of sensitivity in the physiological range, and by its analysis with an inaccurate formalism. The alternative use of h ␤/␣ takes advantage of tissue analysis by 31 P NMR spectroscopy which is non destructive and therefore capable of use in living subjects. Additionally, the h ␤/␣ measures only cytosolic ATP and requires neither an enzyme catalyzed equilibrium nor the administration of an exogenous agent of lesser known tissue distribution and allergenic potential. While peak heights may be altered by a number of other factors, such as excess amounts of paramagnetic substances or other factors severely altering the magnetic environment, this new method for estimation of free [Mg 2ϩ ] in tissue may provide further insights into the physiological and therapeutic role of [Mg 2ϩ ] in a number of disease states  (32) . Hitherto a deficiency of free intracellular [Mg 2ϩ ] could only be inferred from measurement of magnesium retention after intravenous administration  (30) .
