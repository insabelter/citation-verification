Introduction
The study of various types of integral inequalities has been the focus of great attention for well over a century by a number of mathematicians, interested in both pure and applied mathematics. One of the many fundamental mathematical discoveries of Ostrowski  [1]  is the following classical integral inequality associated with the differentiable mappings: is the best possible. Ostrowski inequality has applications in quadrature, probability and optimization theory, stochastic, statistics, information, and integral operator theory. During the past few years, a number of scientists have focused on Ostrowski-type inequalities for function of bounded variation, see, for example,  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ,  [12, pp. 468-484] . Until now, a large number of research papers and books have been written on Ostrowski inequalities and their numerous applications. On the other hand, many studies have recently been carried out in the field of q-analysis, starting with Euler due to a high demand for mathematics that models quantum computing q-calculus appeared as a connection between mathematics and physics. It has several applications in different mathematical areas such as number theory, combinatorics, orthogonal polynomials, basic hypergeometric functions, and other sciences, quantum theory, mechanics, and the theory of relativity  [13] [14] [15] [16] . Apparently, Euler was the founder of this branch of mathematics, by using the parameter q in Newton's work on infinite series. Later, Jackson was the first to develop q-calculus that knows without limit calculus in a systematic way  [13] . In 1908-1909, Jackson defined the general q-integral and q-difference operator  [15] . In 1969, Agarwal described the q-fractional derivative for the first time [17]. In 1966-1967, Al-Salam introduced a q-analogue of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral operator and the q-fractional integral operator [18]. In 2004, Rajkovic et al.  [19]  gave a definition of the Riemann-type q-integral that generalized the Jackson q-integral. In 2013, Tariboon and Ntouyas introduced the D q a -difference operator  [20] . Recently, in 2020,  Bermudo et al.  introduced the notion of D q b derivative and integral  [21] . Many well-known integral inequalities such as Hölder inequality, Hermite-Hadamard inequalities, Ostrowski inequality, Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality, Gruss inequality, Gruss-Cebyšev inequality, and other integral inequalities have been studied in the setup of q-calculus using the concept of classical convexity. For more results in this direction, the readers may refer to  [8, 13, 14, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . 2 Preliminaries of q-calculus and some inequalities In this section, we first present some known definitions and related inequalities in q-calculus. Set the follow- ing notation (see  [16] ): [ ] = - - = + + +⋯+ ∈ ( ) - n q q q q q q 1 1 1 , 0 , 1 . q n n 2 1 Jackson  [15]  defined the q-Jackson integral of a given function f from 0 to b as follows: ∫ ∑ ( ) = ( -) ( ) < < = ∞ f x d x q b q f bq q 1 , where 0 1 b q n n n 0 0 (2.1) provided that the sum converges absolutely. Jackson  [15]  defined the q-Jackson integral of a given function over the interval [ ] a b , as follows: ∫ ∫ ∫ ( ) = ( ) - ( ) f x d x f x d x f x d x. a b q b q a q 0 0 Definition 2.1. [20] Let [ ] → f a b : , be a continuous function. The q a -derivative of f at ∈ [ ] x a b , is identified by the following expression: ( ) = ( ) -( + ( -) ) ( -)( -) ≠ D f x f x f qx q a q x a x a 1 1 , . q a (2.2) Since [ ] → f a b : , is a continuous function, we can define ( ) = ( ) → D f a D f x lim . q a x a q a The function f is said to be q a -differentiable on [ ] a b , if ( ) D f x q a exists for all ∈ [ ] x a b , . If we take = a 0 in (2.2), then we have ( ) = ( ) D f x D f x q q 0 , where ( ) D f x q is a known q-derivative of f at ∈ [ ] x a b , (see  [16] ) given by ( ) = ( ) -( ) ( -) ≠ D f x f x f qx q x x 1 , 0. q Definition 2.2. [21] Let [ ] → f a b : , be a continuous function. The q b -derivative of f at ∈ [ ] x a b , is given by ( ) = ( + ( -) ) -( ) ( -)( -) ≠ D f x f qx q b f x q b x x b 1 1 , . q b Definition 2.3. Let [ ] → f a b : , be a continuous function. The second q b -derivative of f at ∈ [ ] x a b , is given by ( + ( -) ) = ( ( + ( -) )) = ( + ( - ) ) -( + ) ( + ( -) ) + ( + ( -) ) ( -) ( -) D f ta t b D D f ta t b f q ta tq b q f qta qt b qf ta t b q q b a t 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . q b q b q b 2 2 2 2 22 Definition 2.4. [20] Let [ ] → f a b : , be a continuous function. Then, the q a -definite integral on [ ] a b , is defined by ∫ ∫ ∑ ( ) = ( -)( -) ( + ( -) ) = ( -) (( -) + ) = ∞ f x d x q b a q f q b q a b a f t a tb d t 1 1 1 . a b q a n n n n q 0 0 1 Alp et al.  [26]  proved the following q a -Hermite-Hadamard inequalities for convex functions in the setting of quantum calculus: Theorem 2.5. If [ ] → f a b : , is a convex differentiable function on [ ] a b , and < < q 0 1, then we have       ∫ + [ ] ≤ - ( ) ≤ ( ) + ( ) [ ] f qa b b a f x d x qf a f b 2 1 2 . q a b q a q (2.3) In  [26]  and  [39] , the authors established some bounds for the left-and right-hand sides of the inequality (2.3). On the other hand, in  [21] , Bermudo et al. gave the following definition and obtained the related Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities: Definition 2.6. [21] Let [ ] → f a b : , be a continuous function. Then, the q b -definite integral on [ ] a b , is given by ∫ ∫ ∑ ( ) = ( -)( -) ( + ( -) ) = ( -) ( + ( -) ) = ∞ f x d x q b a q f q a q b b a f ta t b d t 1 1 1 . a b q b n n n n q 0 0 1 Theorem 2.7.

Lemma 2.10. If [ ] ⊂ → f a b : , is a q-differentiable function on ( ) a b , such that D f q a is continuous and integrable on [ ] a b , , then we have: ∫ ∫ ∫ ( ) - - ( ) = ( -) - ( + ( -) ) + ( -) - ( + ( -) ) f x b a f t d t q x a b a t D f tx t a d t q b x b a t D f tx t b d t 1 1 1 , a x q a q a q q a q 2 0 1 2 0 1 where < < q 0 1. Theorem 2.11. Let [ ] ⊂ → f a b : , be a q-differentiable function on ( ) a b , , such that D f q a is continuous and integrable on [ ] a b , . If | | D f q a is convex on [ ] a b , and | | ≤ D f M q a , then ∫ ( ) - - ( ) ≤ [( -) + ( -) ] ( -)( + ) f x b a f t d t qM x a b x b a q 1 1 , a x q a 2 2 where < < q 0 1. In this paper, we establish some quantum Ostrowski-type inequalities for twice q-differentiable functions.

New Ostrowski-type inequalities for quantum integrals
In this section, we prove Ostrowski-type inequalities for twice quantum differentiable functions involving the quantum integrals. Let's start with the following useful lemma. Lemma 3.1. If [ ] ⊂ → f a b : , is a twice q-differentiable function on ( ) a b , , such that D f q b 2 and D f q a 2 are continuous and integrable on [ ] a b , , then we have:         ∫ ∫ ( -) ( -) ( -) ( + ( -) ) + ( -) ( + ( -) ) = ( ) x a b x a x t D f tx t a d t x b t D f tx t b d t L x 1 1 , q a q q b q q b a 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 2 (3.1) where         ∫ ∫ ( ) = ( -)( -) ( -) [( -) ( + ( -) ) + ( -) ( + ( -) ) -( + -)( -) ( )] - [ ] ( -) ( ) + ( -) ( ) L x x a b x q q x a qf qx q b b x qf qx q a q q b a f x q x a f t d t b x f t d t 1 1 1 1 2 q b a q x b q b a x q a 3 2 3 2 2 and < < q 0 1.

Conclusion
We conclude our work by mentioning that here, we proved some new quantum integral inequalities of Ostrowski-type for twice quantum differentiable functions by using the notions of quantum derivatives and quantum integrals. It is important to mention that our results transformed into some new and known results by considering the limit → - q 1 in our main results. We strongly believe that it is an interesting and new problem for the upcoming researchers who can obtain similar inequalities via quantum fractional calculus in their future work.
