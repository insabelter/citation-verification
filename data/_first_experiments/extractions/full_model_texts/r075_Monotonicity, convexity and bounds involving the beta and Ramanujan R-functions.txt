Γ(x) = ∞ 0 t x-1 e -t dt, ψ(x) = Γ (x) Γ(x) .
In particular, if y = 1x , then we denote R(x) = R(x, 1 -x) = -2γ -ψ(x) -ψ(1 -x) (1.1) and B(x) = B(x, 1 -x) = Γ(x)Γ(1 -x) = π sin(πx) . (1.2) From (1.1) and (1.2) we clearly see that both the functions R(x) and B(x) are symmetry with respect to x = 1/2 . Therefore, we only need to assume that x ∈ (0, 1/2] in what follows. It is easy to know that R(1/2) = log 16 by  (1.1) . Let a, b, c ∈ R with c = 0, -1, -2, •••. Then the Gaussian hypergeometric function F(a, b; c; x)  [1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9]  is defined by F(a, b; c; x) = 2 F 1 (a, b; c; x) = ∞ ∑ n=0 (a, n)(b, n) (c, n) x n n! (-1 < x < 1),  (1.3)  where (a, n) denotes the shifted factorial function (a, n) ≡ a(a + 1) •••(a + n -1) for n ∈ N, and (a, 0) = 1 for a = 0 . It is well known that F(a, b; c; x) has wide applications in mathematics and physics, and many elementary and special functions are the particular or limiting cases of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. In particular, if c = a + b , then F(a, b; c; x) is said to be zero-balanced. As the special case of the Gaussian hypergeometric function, the generalized elliptic integral K a (r)  [3, 5]  of the first kind can be expressed by K a (r) = π 2 F a, 1 -a;1;r 2 , K a (0 + ) = π 2 , K a (1 -) = ∞ (1.4) for r ∈ (0, 1) and a ∈ (0, 1/2]. The Ramanujan R-function and Beta function are closely related to the Guassian hypergeometric function F(a, b; c; x) and the generalized elliptic integral K a (r) of the first kind. For example, F(a, b; a + b; x) satisfies the asymptotic formula  [4]   B(a, b)F(a, b; a + b; x) + log(1 -x) = R(a, b) + O((1 -x) log(1 -x)) (x → 1), and K a (r) has the sharp asymptotical inequalities  [20]   π 1 + B(x) R(x) -1 (1 -r 2 ) < B(x)K a (r) log(e R(x)/2 / √ 1 -r 2 ) < π 1 + a(1 -a)(1 -r 2 ) and π R(x) + [B(x) -R(x)]r 2 < K a (r) log(e R(x)/2 / √ 1 -r 2 ) < π B(a)[1 -a(1 -a) + a(1 -a)r 2 ] for all a ∈ (0, 1/2] and r ∈ (0, 1). More properties for B(x) and R(x) can be found in the literature  [2, 4, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23] , in which they used to study the generalized η k -distortion function η a k (t) and the generalized λ -distortion function λ (a, K) = η a K  (1) . Recently, the properties and bounds for B(x) and R(x) have attracted the attention of many researchers  [17, 23] . Qiu, Ma, and Huang  [18]  found the power series expansions of the function R(x) -B(x) at x = 0 and x = 1/2 , and proved that 2(2c 2n + α 2n-1 )x 2n+1 B(x) -R(x) + 2 n ∑ k=1 c k x k (2c 2n + α 2n-1 )x 2n and (2c 2n+1 + α 2n )x 2n+1 B(x) -R(x) + 2 2n+1 ∑ k=1 c k x k 2(2c 2n+1 + α 2n )x 2(n+1) , where c n = (-1) n + [1 + (-1) n+1 ]2 -n-1 ζ (n + 1), α n = 2 n+1 (π -log 16 + 2 n ∑ k=1 2 -k c k ) and ζ (s) = ∞ ∑ k=1 1 k s (Re s > 1) (1.5) is the Riemann zeta function. In  [13] , Huang, Qiu, and Ma discussed the monotonicity and convexity properties of the functions x(1x)B(x) and R(x)-[1x(1x)]B(x), and discovered new bounds for the complete integral K a (r) of the first kind. The main purpose of the article is to provide new monotonicity and convexity properties involving the Ramanujan R-function R(x) and Beta function B(x).

Lemmas and definition
In order to prove our main results, we need two lemmas and one definition which we present in this section. Let n ∈ N. Then the the special sums of reciprocal powers λ (n + 1), η(n) and β (n)  [1]  are defined by λ (n + 1) = ∞ ∑ k=0 1 (2k + 1) n+1 , η(n) = ∞ ∑ k=1 (-1) k-1 1 k n , β (n) = ∞ ∑ k=0 (-1) k 1 (2k + 1) n . (2.1) It follows from  [1, 23.2.20]  that λ (n + 1) = 1 -2 -n-1 ζ (n + 1), η(n) = 1 -2 1-n ζ (n). (2.2) LEMMA 2.1. The following two conclusions can be found in the literature  [13] : (1) If x ∈ (0, 1/2], then one has B(x) = 1 x + ∞ ∑ n=1 [1 -(-1) n ]η(n + 1)x n = 4 ∞ ∑ n=0 β (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n (2.3) and R(x) = 1 x + ∞ ∑ n=1 [1 + (-1) n ]ζ (n + 1)x n = log 16 + 4 ∞ ∑ n=1 λ (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n . (2.4) (2) The function λ (n) is strictly decreasing for n ∈ N \ {1} with λ (2) = π 2 /8 and λ (n) → 1 as n → +∞, and the function β (n) is strictly increasing for n ∈ N with β (1) = π/4 and β (n) → 1 as n → +∞. LEMMA 2.2. (See [2]) Let -∞ < a < b < ∞, f, g : [a, b] → R be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) such that g (x) = 0 on (a, b). If f (x)/g (x) is increasing (decreasing) on (a, b), then so are the functions [ f (x) -f (a)]/[g(x) -g(a)] and [ f (x) -f (b)]/[g(x) -g(b)]. If f (x)/g (x) is strictly monotone, then the monotonicity in the conclusion is also strict. DEFINITION 2.1. (See  [11] ,  [12] ,  [22] ) A real-valued function f is said to be strictly completely monotonic on an interval I ⊆ R if (-1) n f (n) (x) > 0 for all x ∈ I and n = 0, 1, 2, 3 •••. If (-1) n f (n) (x) 0 for all x ∈ I and n = 0, 1, 2, 3 •••, then f is said to be completely monotonic on I .

Main results
For the convenience of narration, we denote f (x) = x(1 -x)B(x) and g(x) = R(x) -[1 -x(1 -x)]B(x) throughout this section. THEOREM 3.1. Both the functions f (x) and g(x) are completely monotonic on (0, 1/2]. Proof. It follows from (2.3) that f (x) = x(1 -x)B(x) = 1 -(1 -2x) 2 ∞ ∑ n=0 β (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n = π 4 + ∞ ∑ n=1 [β (2n + 1) -β (2n -1)](1 -2x) 2n and β (2n + 1) -β (2n -1) > 0. Elaborated computations lead to f (k) (x) = ∞ ∑ n=[k/2] (-1) k 2 k (2n)! (2n -k)! [β (2n + 1) -β (2n -1)](1 -2x) 2n-k . Therefore, (-1) k f (k) (x) 0 for all x ∈ (0, 1/2] and k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ••• and f (x) is com- pletely monotonic on (0, 1/2]. It is easy to verify that f (x) is decreasing, f (2n) (x) is decreasing and f (2n+1) (x) is strictly increasing on (0, 1/2] for n ∈ N. It follows from 2.1(2) that g(x) = R(x) -[1 -x(1 -x)]B(x) = log 16 + 4 ∞ ∑ n=1 λ (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n -4[1 -x(1 -x)] ∞ ∑ n=0 β (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n = log 16 + 4 ∞ ∑ n=1 λ (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n -[(1 -2x) 2 + 3] ∞ ∑ n=0 β (2n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n = log 16 - 3π 4 + ∞ ∑ n=1 [4λ (2n + 1) -β (2n -1) -3β (2n + 1)](1 -2x) 2n , (3.1) 4λ (2n + 1) -β (2n -1) -3β (2n + 1) > 4[λ (2n + 1) -β (2n -1)] > 0 and g (k) (x) = ∞ ∑ n=[k/2] (-1) k 2 k (2n)! (2n -k)! [4λ (2n + 1) -β (2n -1) -3β (2n + 1)](1 -2x) 2n-k . Therefore, (-1) k g (k) (x) 0 for all x ∈ (0, 1/2] and k = 0, 1, 2, 3 •••, and g(x) is completely monotonic on (0, 1/2]. It is easy to check that g(x) is decreasing, g (2n) (x) is decreasing and g (2n+1) (x) is strictly increasing on (0, 1/2] for n ∈ N. Let ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ A 1 (1) = -1, A 1 (2) = 2η(2), A 1 (2k -1) = -2η(2k -2), A 1 (2k) = 2η(2k) ( k 2), A 2 (0) = β (1) = π 4 , A 2 (k) = β (2k + 1) -β (2k -1) (k 1). (3.2) THEOREM 3.2. Let n ∈ N. Then the following statements are true:  (1)  The function H 1 n (x) defined by H 1 n (x) = f (x) -P 1 n (x) x 2n+1 with P 1 n (x) = 1 + ∑ 2n k=1 A 1 (k)x k is strictly increasing and concave from (0, 1/2] onto (-2η(2n), H 1 n (1/2)]. In particular, the double inequality 2 H 1 n 1 2 + 2η(2n) x 2n+2 x(1 -x)B(x) -P 1 n (x) + 2η(2n)x 2n+1 H 1 n 1 2 + 2η(2n) x 2n+1 (3.3) holds for all n ∈ N and x ∈ (0, 1/2], and each inequality of  (3.3)  becomes equality if and only if x = 1/2 . (2) The function H 2 n (x) defined by H 2 n (x) = f (x) -P 2 n (x) x 2n with P 2 n (x) = 1 + ∑ 2n-1 k=1 A 1 (k)x k is strictly decreasing and convex from (0, 1/2] onto [H 2 n (1/2), 2η(2n)). In particular, the two-sided inequality H 2 n 1 2 -2η(2n) x 2n x(1 -x)B(x) -P 2 n (x) -2η(2n)x 2n 2 H 2 n 1 2 -2η(2n) x 2n+1 (3.4) takes place for all n ∈ N and x ∈ (0, 1/2], and each inequality of  (3.4)  reduces to equality if and only if x = 1/2 . (3) The function I n (x) defined by I n (x) = f (x) -P 3 n (x) (1 -2x) 2n+2 , with P 3 n (x) = ∑ n k=0 A 2 (k)(1 -2x) 2k is strictly decreasing and convex from (0, 1/2) onto (A 2 (n + 1), I n (0 + )). In particular, the double inequality 0 x(1 -x)B(x) -P 3 n (x) -A 2 (n + 1)(1 -2x) 2n+2 I n (0 + ) -A 2 (n + 1) (1 -2x) 2n+3 (3.5) is valid for all n ∈ N and x ∈ (0, 1/2), and each inequality of (3.5) becomes equality if and only if x = 1/2 . Proof. (1) Let h 1 (x) = f (x)-P 1 n (x) and h 2 (x) = x 2n+1 . Then H 1 n (x) = h 1 (x)/h 2 (x), h (m) 1 (0 + ) = h (m) 2 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪ {0} with 0 m 2n , and h (2n+1) 1 (x) h (2n+1) 2 (x) = f (2n+1) (x) (2n + 1)! . From Lemma 2.2 we know that H 1 n (x) has the same monotonicity with the function f (2n+1) (x) if f (2n+1) (x) is monotonic. Therefore, it follows from Theorem 3.1 that H 1 n (x) is increasing on (0, 1/2]. Elaborated computations lead to (H 1 n (x)) = h 1 (x) h 2 (x) = x f (x) -P 1 n (x) -(2n + 1) f (x) -P 1 n (x) x 2n+2 = ∑ ∞ k=n (2n -2k + 2)η(2k)x 2k+1 + (2k -2n -1)η(2k + 2)x 2k+2 2x 2n+2 . Let h 3 (x) = x 2n+2 and h 4 (x) = ∞ ∑ k=n (2n -2k + 2)η(2k)x 2k+1 + (2k -2n -1)η(2k + 2)x 2k+2 . Then we clearly see that h (m) 3 (0 + ) = h (m) 4 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪{0} with 0 m 2n , and h (2n+1) 3 (x) h (2n+1) 4 (x) = f (2n+2) (x) (2n + 2)! . From Lemma 2.2 we know that (H 1 n (x)) has the same monotonicity with the function f (2n) (x) if f (2n) (x) is monotonic. It follows from Theorem 3.1 that the desired monotonicity of the function (H 1 n (x)) is obtained and the desired concavity of the function H 1 n (x) is proved. Note that H 1 n (0 + ) = -2η(2n). Therefore, inequalities (3.3) follows from the monotonicity and concavity of the function H 1 n (x). (2) Let h 5 (x) = f (x)-P 2 n (x) and h 6 (x) = x 2n . Then H 2 n (x) = h 5 (x)/h 6 (x), h (m) 5 (0 + ) = h (m) 6 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪ {0} with 0 m 2n -1, and h (2n) 5 (x) h (2n) 6 (x) = f (2n) (x) (2n)! . From Lemma 2.2 we know that H 2 n (x) has the same monotonicity with the function f (2n) (x). Making use of Theorem 3.1, we know that H 2 n (x) is decreasing on (0, 1/2]. Simple computations give (H 2 n (x)) = x f (x) -P 2 n (x) -(2n + 1) f (x) -P 2 n (x) x 2n-1 = ∑ ∞ k=n (2k -2n)η(2k)x 2k + (2n -2k -1)η(2k)x 2k+1 2x 2n-1 . Let h 7 (x) = x 2n-1 and h 8 (x) = ∞ ∑ k=n (2k -2n)η(2k)x 2k + (2n -2k -1)η(2k)x 2k+1 . Then h (m) 7 (0 + ) = h (m) 8 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪ {0} with 0 m 2n -1, and h (2n) 7 (x) h (2n) 8 (x) = f (2n-1) (x) (2n -1)! . According to Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 2.2, we can get the desired convexity of H 2 n (x). Using the monotonicity and concavity of H 2 n (x), we obtain inequality (3.4). (3) It follows from (2.3) that I n (x) = f (x) -P 3 n (x) (1 -2x) 2n+2 = ∞ ∑ k=0 A 2 (k + n + 1)(1 -2x) 2k . Lemma 2.1(2) leads to the conclusion that A 2 (k + n + 1) > 0 for all k, n ∈ N. By the monotonicity of (1 -2x) 2k , we can know that I n (x) is decreasing on (0, 1/2]. Simple computations lead to I n (x) > 0 , which implies that I n (x) is convex. Therefore, inequality (3.5) follows from the monotonicity and convexity of the function I n (x). Let n = 1 . Then inequality (3.3) leads to Corollary 3.3 immediately. COROLLARY 3.3. The double inequality 1 -x + π 2 6 x 2 - π 2 6 x 3 + 2 2π -4 - π 2 6 x 4 x(1 -x)B(x) 1 -x + π 2 6 x 2 + 2π -4 - π 2 3 x 3 (3.6) holds for all x ∈ (0, 1/2]. REMARK 3.4. Corollary 3.3 provide new lower and upper bounds for x(1-x)B(x) in term of cubic and quartic polynomials, respectively. Let n = 2 . Then inequality (3.4) becomes Corollary 3.5. COROLLARY 3.5. The two-sided inequality 1 -x + π 2 6 x 2 - π 2 6 x 3 + 4π -8 - π 2 3 x 4 x(1 -x)B(x) 1 -x + π 2 6 x 2 - π 2 6 x 3 + 7π 4 360 x 4 + 2 4π -8 - π 2 3 - 7π 4 360 x 5 (3.7) takes place for x ∈ (0, 1/2]. REMARK 3.6. Inequality (3.7) provide new lower and upper bounds for x(1x)B(x) in term of quartic and quintic polynomials, respectively. Let n = 1 . Then inequality (3.5) reduces to Corollary 3.7.

The double inequality P 3 1 (x) + A 2 (2)(1 -2x) 4 x(1 -x)B(x) P 3 1 (x) + A 2 (2)(1 -2x) 4 + I 1 (0 + ) -A 2 (2) (1 -2x) 5 (3.8) is valid for x ∈ (0, 1/2], where A 2 (2) = 5π 5 1536 - π 3 32 = 0.02722 •••, I 1 (0 + ) = - π 2 32 + 1 = 0.69157 •••, P 3 1 (x) = π 4 + π 32 π 2 -8 (1 -2x) 2 , and each inequality of  (3.8)  becomes equality if and only if x = 1/2 . REMARK 3.8. Inequality (3.8) provide new asymptotic sharp lower and upper bounds for the function x(1x)B(x) by the polynomial function of (1 -2x). Next, we present several new properties the function g (x) = R(x) -[1 -x(1 - x)]B(x).

(3.9) THEOREM 3.9. Let n ∈ N. Then the following statements are true: (1) Then function G 1 n (x) defined by G 1 n (x) = g(x) -R 1 n (x) x 2n with R 1 n (x) = ∑ 2n-1 k=0 B 1 (k)x k is strictly decreasing and convex from (0, 1/2] into [G 1 n (1/2), B 1 (2n)). In particular, the double inequality G 1 n 1 2 -B 1 (2n) x 2n g(x) -R 1 n (x) -B 1 (2n)x 2n 2 G 1 n 1 2 -B 1 (2n) x 2n+1 (3.10) holds for all n ∈ N and x ∈ (0, 1/2], and each inequality of (3.10) becomes equality if and only if x = 1/2 . (2) The function G 2 n (x) defined by G 2 n (x) = g(x) -R 2 n (x) x 2n+1 with R 2 n (x) = ∑ 2n k=0 B 1 (k)x k is strictly increasing and concave from (0, 1/2] into (B 1 (2n+ 1), G 2 n (1/2)]. In particular, the two-sided inequality 2 G 2 n 1 2 -B 1 (2n + 1) x 2n+2 g(x) -R 2 n (x) -B 1 (2n + 1)x 2n+1 G 2 n 1 2 -B 1 (2n + 1) x 2n+1 (3.11) is valid for all n ∈ N and x ∈ (0, 1/2], and each inequality of  (3.11)  becomes equality if and only if x = 1/2 . (3) The function K n (x) defined by K n (x) = g(x) -R 3 n (x) (1 -2x) 2n , with R 3 n (x) = ∑ n-1 k=0 B 2 (k)(1 -2x) 2k is strictly decreasing and convex from (0, 1/2) onto (B 2 (n), K n (0 + )). In particular, the double inequality 0 g(x) -R 3 n (x) -B 2 (n)(1 -2x) 2n K n 0 + -B 2 (n) (1 -2x) 2n+1 (3.12) takes place for all n ∈ N and x ∈ (0, 1/2], and each inequality of (3.12) becomes equality if and only if x = 1/2 . Proof. (1) Let g 1 (x) = g(x) -R 1 n (x) and g 2 (x) = x 2n . Then G 1 n (x) = g 1 (x)/g 2 (x), g (m) 1 (0 + ) = g (m) 2 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪ {0} with 0 m 2n + 1, and g (2n) 1 (x) g (2n) 2 (x) = g (2n) (x) (2n)! . From Lemma 2.2 we know that the function G 1 n (x) has the same monotonicity with the function g (2n) (x) if g (2n) (x) is monotonic. Therefore, G 1 n (x) is decreasing on (0, 1/2] follows from Theorem 3.1. Elaborated computations lead to (G 1 n (x)) = g 1 (x) g 2 (x) = x g(x) -R 1 n (x) -2n g(x) -R 1 n (x) x 2n+1 = g 3 (x) g 4 (x) , where g 3 (x) = x g(x) -R 1 n (x) -2n g(x) -R 1 n (x) , g 4 (x) = x 2n+1 . Making use of (3.1), g 3 (x) can be rewritten as g 3 (x) = ∞ ∑ k=2n kB 1 (k)x k-1 . It is easy to check that g (m) 3 (0 + ) = g (m) 4 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪ {0} with 0 m 2n + 2, and g (2n) 3 (x) g (2n) 4 (x) = g (2n+1) (x) (2n + 1)! . It follows from Lemma 2.2 that the function (G 1 n (x)) has the same monotonicity with the function g (2n+1) (x) if g (2n+1) (x) is monotonic. Therefore, Theorem 3.1 leads to the conclusion that (G 1 n (x)) is strictly increasing on (0, 1/2] and we obtain the desired convexity of G 1 n (x). Note that G 1 n (0 + ) = B 1 (2n). Hence, inequality (3.10) follows from the monotonicity and convexity of G 1 n (x). (2) Let g 5 (x) = g(x) -R 2 n (x) and g 6 (x) = x 2n+1 . Then G 2 n (x) = g 5 (x)/g 6 (x), g (m) 5 (0 + ) = g (m) 6 (0 + ) = 0 for all m ∈ N ∪ {0} with 0 m 2n , and g (2n+1) 5 (x) g (2n+1) 6 (x) = g (2n+1) (x) (2n + 1)! . Therefore, G 2 n (x) is strictly increasing on (0, 1/2] follows easily from Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 3.1. Simple computations lead to (G 2 n (x)) = g 5 (x) g 6 (x) = x g(x) -R 2 n (x) -(2n + 1) g(x) -R 2 n (x) x 2n+2 = g 7 (x) g 8 (x) , where g 7 (x) = x g(x) -R 2 n (x) -(2n + 1) g(x) -R 2 n (x) , g 8 (x) = x 2n+2 . From (3.1) we clearly see that g 7 (x) can be rewritten as g 7 (x) = ∞ ∑ k=2n+1 kB 1 (k)x k-1 . It is easy to check that g (x) g (2n+1) 8 (x) = g (2n+2) (x) (2n + 2)! . Therefore, (G 2 n (x)) is strictly decreasing on (0, 1/2] follows from Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 3.1. Note that G 2 n (0 + ) = B 1 (2n + 1). Hence, inequality (3.11) can be derived from the monotonicity and concavity of the function G 2 n (x). (3) It follows from (3.1) that g(x) -R 3 n (x) = ∞ ∑ k=0 [4λ (2k + 2n + 1) -β (2k + 2n -1) -3β (2k + 2n + 1)](1 -2x) 2k+2n and K n (x) = ∞ ∑ k=0 [4λ (2k + 2n + 1) -β (2k + 2n -1) -3β (2k + 2n + 1)](1 -2x) 2k . According to the monotonicity of β (n) and (1 -2x) 2k we know that K n (x) is decreasing on (0, 1/2]. Simple computations show that K n (x) > 0 , which implies that K n (x) is convex. Note that K n (1/2 -) = B 2 (n). Therefore, inequality (3.12) can be obtained by using the monotonicity and convexity of the function K n (x). Let n = 2 . Then inequality  (3.10)    (x) + B 1 (3)x 3 + 2 G 2 1 1 2 -B 1 (3) x 4 R(x) -[1 -x(1 -x)]B(x) (3.13) R 2 1 (x) + B 1 (3)x 3 + G 2 1 1 2 -B 1 (3) x 3 holds for all x ∈ (0, 1/2], and each inequality of  (3.13)   Let n = 2 . Then inequality (3.12) leads to Corollary 3.12. COROLLARY 3.12.
