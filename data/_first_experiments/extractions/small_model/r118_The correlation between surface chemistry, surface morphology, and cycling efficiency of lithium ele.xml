<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Lithium electrodes in a few selected polar aprotic electrolyte systems were investigated using electrochemical techniques in conjunction with surface-sensitive Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The solvents used were ~-butyrolactone (BL), propylene carbonate (PC), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the salts included LiC104 and LiAsF6. Cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes was correlated to their surface chemistry and morphology in the various solvent systems. The effects of both water and o~ygen contamination were rigorously studied. It was found that the presence of oxygen in solutions considerably increased the cycling efficiency of the lithium electrode. This effect correlates well with the influence of the presence of oxygen on the surface morphology of lithium electrodes in solutions. The presence of water increases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in PC, and decreases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in ethers. These results are discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in the various solvent systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the challenges in modern electrochemistry is to improve the cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic electrolyte systems comprised of organic solvents and Li salts, where lithium is apparently stable. The achievement of high reversibility for lithium electrodes will obviously advance the development of reliable commercial secondary batteries of the highest energy density. A variety of polar aprotic solvent systems have been investigated in the past two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Several attempts to correlate lithium cycling efficiency with the physical and electrical properties of the polar aprotic media (e.g., conductivity, solvation parameters, viscosity, etc.) have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4)</ref>.</p><p>However, it is widely believed that the major factor that controls the electrochemical behavior of the lithium electrode in polar aprotic systems is the nature of the films formed on the electrode surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6)</ref>. Several research groups have tried to improve the reversibility of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic systems by modifying the 'natural' surface films by an addition of traces of active reagents to the solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>.

Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency. Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Uncontaminated LiCl04 solutions.--Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> shows a typical SEM micrograph of a smooth, mirror-like lithium surface which was prepared by shearing off the surface layer (scraping it with a stainless steel knife), followed by smoothing (rolling it with a clean glass tube). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> shows SEM micrographs obtained from Li surfaces on which lithium was galvanostatically deposited from LiClO4 solutions of THF, PC, and B L (5a, 5b, and 5c, respectively). Single dendrites at higher magnification are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref> and 6b (obtained from PC and BL/LiC104 solutions, respectively). These micrographs show typical locations of dendrite formation (along cracks or stress lines). Also, the dendrites, as shown, have a lot of narrow regions (bottlenecks) where corrosion or mechanical shock can easily disconnect them from the bulk. We carried out a series of experiments in which Li electrodes were charged (Li deposition); followed by consecutive discharge (Li dissolution) in the various systems. The charge involved in the anodic process was in excess of 10% of the cathodic one. In all cases, the dissolution process leaves m a n y dendrites untouched, and holes are formed. In other experiments, Li electrodes were cycled 5-30 times, followed by prolonged dissolution (twice the charge involved in a single half cycle) as a final process. SEM studies of these electrodes show that the density and average size of the dendrites left increase as a function of n u m b e r of cycles. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> summarizes the data obtained from the cycling efficiency m e a s u r e m e n t s of Li electrodes in the various systems.</p><p>All the LiC104 salt solutions studied in this work have quite a poor lithium cycling efficiency. It should be noticed that the values of Table I are s o m e w h a t lower than cycling efficiency values of same solvents that appear in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>. There are two major reasons for these differences:</p><p>1. The values of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> were obtained from experiments in which lithium was deposited on nickel or copper substrates. Naturally, lithium deposition on a lithium substrate is expected to have a higher efficiency, since adherence of Li deposits to lithium substrate is better <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>.</p><p>2. We found that in several solvent systems, cycling efficiency increases as electrolyte concentration increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>. A m a x i m u m cycling efficiency of lithium electrode in PC-LiC104 was achieved at salt concentration around 1M (2O).</p><p>In the present work, salt concentration in most of the experiments was around 0.5M, which is somewhat lower than the electrolyte concentrations where m a x i m a in cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes are achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23)</ref>. The poor lithium cycling efficiency obtained in the three solvent systems (which correlate nicely with the SEM studies indicating massive dendrite formation during Li deposition) should be discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in these solvents ob- tained by the F T I R measurements. It is generally accepted that the electrochemical behavior of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic solvents is surface films-controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6)</ref>. Since the resistance of these films to lithium cation transport is the main activation barrier to the electrochemical deposition or dissolution of lithium, the effectiveness and uniformity of Li cation passage through these films are the key factors which determine the cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes.</p><p>The transport of lithium cations through these films obviously depends on the different lithium-containing functional groups of the organic and inorganic molecules which build the films. These functional groups include alkyl carbonate (ROCO2Li) and inorganic carbonate Li2CO3 in the case of PC ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), organic carboxylate (R-COOLi), alkoxy (R-O-Li), and ~-keto ester anion in the case T h e ethers, w h i c h are far less reactive to l i t h i u m t h a n B L or PC, are e x p e c t e d to form t h e m o s t u n i f o r m films. However, this relative u n r e a c t i v i t      consecutive dissolution, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9c</ref> (obtained from lithium electrode on which lithium was deposited and consecutively dissolved in O2-saturated LiC104-BL solution). Similar behavior was also observed with lithium electrodes cycled several times in O2-saturated BL-LiC104 solutions followed by prolonged dissolution as the final step.</p></div>

These compounds, having strong carbonyl absorptions in the IR around 1650cm -1 and 1350-1300 cm -l, are also major components in surface films formed on lithium in pure PC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>. These results show that PC reacts with oxides to form a bifunctional organic compound containing both OCO2-(carbonate anion) and C-4) (alkoxy groups).</p><p>In this manner, PC resembles BL.

Both spectra show the typical peaks of ROCO2Li compounds, but the spectra obtained from lithium treated in O2-saturated PC have much more intense IR bands than the samples which were identically treated in pure PC.</p><p>Surface films formed on lithium in pure or oxygensaturated BL both have pronounced carboxylate (CO2-) IR peaks around 1580 cm -~ and 1440 cm 1. However, FTIR spectra obtained from lithium samples treated in O2-saturated BL have much stronger carboxylate peaks compared to samples treated identically in pure BL. In both cases, the reaction of the solvent with oxide films, if formed, produces species which are similar to those formed by direct reduction of the pure solvent by lithium. Therefore the presence of oxygen in solutions is not expected to change the main features in the IR spectra. However, the 02 effect on the intensity of the absorption bands is significant.</p><p>All the above results point to the conclusion that 02 modifies the surface chemistry of lithium in all the above solvents. In spite of the low saturation concentration [10 ~-10-4M ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>)], dissolved oxygen seems to react with lithium faster than the solvents. Thus, an oxide layer is formed on the lithium surface. In the case of ethereal systems, the oxide film suppresses solvent reduction and no secondary film is formed. In cases of electrophilic solvents such as PC or BL, the primary oxide film reacts nucleophilically with the solvents to form a secondary film on top of the oxide layer.</p><p>Naturally, one would attribute the pronounced increase in intensity of IR bands of the surface films formed on lithium in the presence of oxygen to an increase in thickness. However, the lower overpotential required for electrochemical deposition and dissolution of lithium when 02 is present as compared to uncontaminated solutions, seems to indicate that the oxygen-originated films are much thinner than those formed naturally by solvent reduction.

LiF is always detected on lithium electrodes in LiAsF6 solutions. The FTIR measurements indicate that the nature of the salt does not change the surface chemistry of the organic films. Therefore, the pronounced salt effect on surface morphology and cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes may be related to the difference in the lithium halides, which precipitate on the lithium surfaces due to salt reduction.</p><p>In the case of LiC104 reduction, precipitation of more than a single type of chloride on the surface, and the size of the chloride anions, may distort homogeneous precipitation of the organic films. Thus, perhaps increasing the nonuniformity of the organic surface films increases the intensity of dendrite formation, and therefore influences cycling efficiency detrimentally. LiAsF6 reduction precipitates only a single compound, LiF, on the surface. The fluoride anion is smaller than chloride, and therefore, LiF precipitation probably interferes far less with the uniformity of the organic surface films, compared to LiC1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Li electrodes have low cycling efficiency in pure LiC104 solutions of PC, BL, and THF. [This correlates with surface morphology studies (SEM) which indicate dendritic deposition of lithium in these solutions.] The poor performance is understood in light of the complicated surface chemistry of lithium in these systems, which leads to a disordered precipitation of multi-functional organic surface species, together with insoluble lithium-chlorine salts.</p><p>Nevertheless, one should not give up the possibility of utilizing LiC104 solutions of PC or BL in secondary lithium batteries, since these systems are much less toxic, volatile, and resistant, compared to LiAsF~ solutions of cyclic ethers (e.g., 1-3 dioxolane, 2-methyl THF) where much higher Li cycling efficiency is obtained. This work proves that surface modification of Li in the active solvents, by the use of chemicals which form better passive films, indeed considerably improves the performance of Li elec-trodes in these systems. Thus, our results should encourage the use of active additives in electrolyte systems for secondary Li batteries as one of the preferred solutions for the problem of Li cycling efficiency in polar aprotic solvents.</p><p>Manuscript submitted <ref type="bibr">July 22, 1988</ref>; revised manuscript received June 2, 1989.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
