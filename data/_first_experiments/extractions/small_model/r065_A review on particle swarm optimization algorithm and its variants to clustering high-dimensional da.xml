<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years there has been an explosive growth in the generation, acquisition and storage of data. This large amount of stored data contains valuable and important hidden knowledge, which could be used to improve the decision-making process of an organization. Extracting information and knowledge from this huge and continuously increasing amount of available data, has become a very complex task and has outpaced our capability to process, analyze, and understand it. Therefore, a process for converting large amounts of data to knowledge will become invaluable. The area of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) has arisen over the last decade to address this challenge. Data mining is a part of the KDD process. Technically, data mining is the process of extracting useful patterns or mining knowledge from large amounts of data through the application of appropriate algorithms, tools, and techniques. Clustering is one of the important and well-known data mining tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Han and Kamber 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Pang-ning et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Clustering means the process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups of similar objects. Each group, called a cluster, consists of objects that are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and which are dissimilar to objects of other groups. The applications of cluster analysis have been used in a wide range of different areas, including artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, biology, computer vision, data compression, image analysis, information retrieval, machine learning, marketing, medicine, pattern recognition, spatial database analysis, statistics, recommendation systems and web mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kriegel et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Luxburg 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The challenge of clustering high-dimensional data has emerged in recent years. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data with anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, biology, bioinformatics, and the clustering of text documents, where, if a word-frequency vector is used, the number of dimensions equals the size of the dictionary. However, high-dimensional data poses different challenges for clustering algorithms that require specialized solutions. In particular, in high-dimensional data, traditional similarity measures, as used in conventional clustering algorithms, are usually not meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kriegel et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Steinbach et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Almost all research on specialized approaches to clustering high dimensional data is relatively new. Recently, some surveys have given overviews of some approaches. In the survey by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Parsons et al. (2004)</ref> the problem is introduced in a very illustrative way and some approaches are sketched out. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kriegel et al. (2009)</ref> the survey took a more systematic approach to the problem and focused on the different tasks and sub-problems (axis-parallel, pattern-based, and arbitrarily-oriented clustering).</p><p>Common approaches for high dimensional cluster analysis either employ dimension reduction at a data preprocessing step or iteratively carry out dimension reduction and clustering. In particular, dimension reduction based on variable selection aims at identifying a subspace spanned by a small set of variables that include most of the relevant variables that generate the nature data clusters and excludes most irrelevant variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Steinbach et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Parsons et al. 2004)</ref>. Variable selection in clustering has been approached from different perspectives: density-based methods such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Agrawal et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chan and Hall 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raftery and Dean 2006)</ref>, model-based methods such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Pan and Shen 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang ans Zhu 2008)</ref>, and criterion-based methods such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Witten and Tibshirani 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raftery and Dean 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of the convergence and the sensitivity to initialization values, etc. and they still require much investigation to improve performance and efficiency. Clustering methods such as the K-means algorithm, soft clustering based on mixed models, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering have been developed and have proven to be successful in many real world applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kriegel et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Luxburg 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Steinbach et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Parsons et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Zhou and Shi 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The K-means (KM) algorithm is one of the most popular and widespread partitioning clustering algorithms because of its superior feasibility and efficiency in dealing with a large amount of data. The main drawback of the KM algorithm is that the cluster result is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster centers and may converge to the local optima <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cui et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kao et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To overcome the drawbacks of these algorithms several new algorithms have been introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Sandeep et al. 2011)</ref>. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on a mutation operator for clustering analysis was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Maulik and Bandyopadhyay (2002)</ref>. Another approach based on Simulated Annealing (SA) for data clustering was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Selim and Alsultan (1991)</ref> and more recently the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and hybrid PSO algorithms were proposed (Van der Merwe and Engelhrecht 2003; <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Omran et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Esmin et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Sandeep et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Particle Swarm Optimization is a population-based stochastic algorithm proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kennedy and Eberhart (1995)</ref>, which is inspired by the social behaviors of animals like fish schooling and bird flocking.

Also the PSO has proved to be competitive with genetic algorithms in several tasks, mainly in optimization areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Silva et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kennedy 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Esmin and Lambert-Torres 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Zhao et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, some surveys have given overviews of PSO and hybrid evolutionary algorithms for data cluster analysis. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Sandeep et al. (2011)</ref> the survey has given a general literature review of the PSO application in data clustering. In Hasan and Ramakrishnan (2011) the survey has given a review of hybrid evolutionary algorithms including PSO for cluster analysis. Both surveys focus on a general cluster analysis problem and most of the reviewed papers focus on the application of PSO to cluster simple data with low dimensional numbers.</p><p>The main advantage of PSO is that it has fewer parameters to adjust. PSO finds the best value for interaction of particles, but when the search space is high its convergence speed becomes very slow near the global optimum. It also shows poor quality results when it deals with large and complex data sets. PSO often failed in searching for a global optimal solution in the case where the objective function has a large number of dimensions. The reason for this phenomenon is not only the existence of the local optimal solutions, but that the velocities of the particles sometimes lapsed into degeneracy, so that the successive range was restricted in the sub-plain of the whole search hyper-plain <ref type="bibr">(Kao et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gao and Xu 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Thangaraj et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The issue of local optima in PSO has been studied and different variants of PSO algorithm were proposed. Some of these variants have been proposed in order to incorporate the capabilities of other evolutionary algorithms, such as hybrid versions of PSO or the adaptation of PSO parameters, thereby creating the adaptive PSO versions. Many authors have considered incorporating selection, mutation, and crossover, as well as differential evolution, into the PSO algorithm. As a result, hybrid versions of PSO have been created and tested, including the hybrid of a genetic algorithm and PSO, a genetic programming-based adaptable evolutionary hybrid PSO, and evolutionary PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Løvbjerg et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miranda and 123 Fonseca 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Esmin et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Rashid and Baig 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Thangaraj et al. 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hiqushi and Iba (2003)</ref> proposed the PSO with Gaussian mutation (GPSO), whose global searching ability is more efficient than the standard PSO. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ling et al. (2008)</ref> proposed a hybrid PSO with wavelet mutation named HWPSO. Using another approach, <ref type="bibr">Sun et al. (2004a, b)</ref> introduced quantum theory into PSO and proposed a quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) algorithm, which can be guaranteed theoretically to find optimal solutions in a search space, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Marinakis et al. (2008)</ref> introduced an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm with better convergence, called weighted QPSO (WQPSO).</p><p>Although such improvements work well and have the ability to avoid a fall in the local optima, the problem of early convergence by the degeneracy of some dimensions still remains, even if there are no local optima. Hence the PSO algorithm does not always work well for the high-dimensional function as well as for the cluster of high-dimensional data <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gao and Xu 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Thangaraj et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>From this point of view, different variants of PSO have been proposed to improve the performance of the PSO algorithm in the case of high-dimensional functions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to give a survey by reviewing PSO algorithm and its variants as applied to clustering large and high-dimensional data.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In the next section a brief description of the PSO is presented. In Sect. 3 the PSO variants are described. Section 4 offers a survey about the previous work done on the particle swarm optimization algorithm and its variants for clustering high-dimensional data. A brief discussion is also provided at the end of this section. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sect. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Particle swarm optimization algorithm</head><p>The PSO algorithm is a population-based optimization method that tries to find the optimal solution using a population of particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kennedy and Eberhart 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Shi and Eberhart 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kennedy and Shi 2002)</ref>. Each particle is an individual, and the swarm is composed of particles. Some of the attractive features of the PSO include ease of implementation and the fact that no gradient information is required. In PSO, the solution space of the problem is formulated as a search space. Each position in the search space is a potential solution of the problem. Particles cooperate to find the best position (best solution) in the search space (solution space). Each particle moves according to its velocity. At each iteration, the particle movement is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x i (t + 1) ← x i (t) + v i (t),</formula><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v i (t + 1) ← ωv i (t) + c 1 r 1 ( pbest i (t) -x i (t)) + c 2 r 2 (gbest (t)) -x i (t))</formula><p>(2)</p><p>In Eqs.</p><p>(1) and (2), x i (t) is the position of particle i at time t, v i (t) is the velocity of particle i at time t, pbest i (t) is the best position found by particle itself so far, gbest(t) is the best position found by the whole swarm so far, ω is an inertia weight scaling the previous time step velocity, c 1 and c 2 are two acceleration coefficients that scale the influence of the best personal position of the particle (pbest i (t)) and the best global position (gbest(t)), and r 1 and r 2 are random variables within the range of 0 and 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Tsai and Chiu 2008)</ref>. Equations ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and (4) define how the personal and global best values are updated at time t, respectively. It is assumed below that the swarm consists of s particles and the objective function f is used to calculate the fitness of the particles with a minimization task.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Thus, i ∈ 1 . . . s pbest i (t + 1) = pbest i (t) if f ( pbest (t)) ≤ f (x i (t + 1)) x i (t + 1) if f ( pbest (t)) &gt; f (x i (t + 1)) (3) gbest (t + 1) = min { f (y), f (gbest (t))} where, y ∈ { pbest 0 (t), pbest 1 (t), . . . , pbest s (t)} (4)</formula><p>The process of PSO is shown as Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Equation (2) consists of three terms. The first term is the current speed of the particle, which shows its present state and has the ability to balance the whole and search a local part. The second term is the cognition term, which expresses the "thought" of the particle itself and causes the swarm to have a strong ability to search the whole and avoid a local minimum. The third term is called the social term; it reflects the information sharing among the swarm and among the particles, leading the particles toward known good solutions. Under the influence of these three terms, the particles can reach an effective and best position. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrated the schematic representation of updating the velocity (Eq. 2) of a particle as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ahmadi et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Two basic approaches to PSO exist based on the interpretation of the neighborhood of particles. Equation (2) reflects the global best (gbest) version of PSO where, for each particle, 123 the neighborhood is simply the entire swarm. The social component then causes particles to be drawn toward the best particle in the swarm. In the local best (lbest) PSO model, the swarm is divided into overlapping neighborhoods, and the best particle of each neighborhood is determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Shi and Eberhart 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kennedy and Shi 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The stopping criterion (termination conditions) mentioned in the aforementioned algorithm depends on the type of problem being solved. Usually, the algorithm is run for a fixed number of iterations (objective function evaluations) or until a specified error bound is reached.</p><p>The description of how the algorithm works is as follows: initially, based on particle fitness information, one particle is identified as the best particle. Then, all the particles are accelerated in the direction of this particle but, at the same time, in the direction of their own best previously encountered solutions. Occasionally, the particles will overshoot their target, exploring the search space beyond the current best particles. All particles also have the chance to discover better particles en route, in which case, the other particles will change direction and head toward the new best particle. Because most functions have some continuity, chances are that a good solution will be surrounded by equally good, or better, solutions. By approaching the current best solution from different directions in search space, the chances that these neighboring solutions will be discovered by some of the particles are good <ref type="bibr">(Kennedy and Shi 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Tsai and Chiu 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The PSO algorithm is very fast, simple and easy to understand and implement. It also has few parameters to adjust <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kennedy et al. 2001)</ref>. PSO finds the best value with interaction of particle, but when the search space is high its convergence speed becomes very slow near global optimum. It also shows poor quality results when it deals with large and complex data set. As aforementioned, several PSO variants have been developed to overcome this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PSO variants</head><p>There are several variants of the PSO algorithm available in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Sedighizadeh and Masehian 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hasan and Ramakrishnan 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Sandeep et al. 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sedighizadeh and Masehian (2009)</ref> discussed the PSO' s Taxonomy and classified these variants according to cooperation, continuity, fuzziness, accordance, attraction, activity, mobility, divisibility, topology, hierarchy, restriction, objective, recursively, uncertainty etc.</p><p>One of the variant was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Yao (2008)</ref>, a Cooperatively Coevolving Particle Swarm Optimization (CCPSO) algorithm for solving large-scale problem by breaking the problem into some smaller-scaled ones in a way that the internal dependencies of generated particles are in the possible least values. Then, these particles will become cooperated. In multidimensional or large problems the PSO does not work well. For solving these types of problems, a Cooperative Multiple PSO (CMPSO) was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Felix et al. (2007)</ref>. This algorithm has all conductivity and control properties of the PSO. In Orthogonal PSO (OPSO), Intelligent Move Method (IMM) is used for updating the velocity and this method provides the best result when dealing with optimization problem of large-scale parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ho et al. 2008</ref>). The Two Swarm-based PSO algorithm helps in escaping from local optimum and avoiding rapid convergence. The two different swarms are flown in space. The particles of these swarms follow different paths, which will enhance the capability of finding global optimum. At the same time other swarm will enhance local discovery by using roulette wheel selection based selection method <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2006a, b)</ref>. To achieve multiple optimizations, Niching PSO is used. Initially the individual particles are monitored and those particles whose fitness changes little is separated in each iteration and a sub swarm is formed. These sub swarms are useful in finding all the global and local optimums <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brits et al. 2005)</ref>. In Optimized PSO, swarms within a swarm help in optimizing the free parameter of PSO. It has been shown by test results that this method performs better than other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Meissner et al. 2006)</ref>. The balance between discovery and extract is very important in algorithm related to PSO.</p><p>In Best Rotation PSO (BRPSO), multi-model functions are optimized by dividing single swarm into sub swarms. In BRPSO when best rotation is executed, stagnation on local minima is avoided by forcing populations to move from one local minimum to another one, increasing the exploration of the problem space between different local minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Alviar et al. 2007</ref>). PSO with spatial particle extension (SEPSO) algorithm uses species, which include a collection of similar particle in a sub swarm. The criterion for finding similarity is the Euclidean distance. When particles move in their species, a parallel multi-objective optimization takes place and helps in increasing convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Krink et al. 2002)</ref>. In parallel PSO a parallel computation is used to reduce the total time when solving large-scale complex problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chang et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>To improve the efficiency of PSO a hybridization of PSO and harmony search is introduced for solving high dimensional problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Li and Li 2007)</ref>. Parallel synchronous PSO (PSPSO) algorithm performs the position and velocity updating at the end of each iteration using wholly simulating. It uses a constant load balancing in which the assigned task to each processor in the total time is determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Koh et al. 2005)</ref>. To solve constrained single objective problem, Constrained Optimization by PSO (COPSO) algorithm is used. These algorithm employees a technique to investigate constrained with the help of an external file to save particle information. This algorithm offers improvement in the best version by using an external procedure, which maintains swarm diversity and guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Aguirre et al. 2007</ref>). Augmented Lagrangian PSO was proposed to solve the optimization problem with equal and unequal constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Sedlaczek and Eberhard 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Adaptive PSO (APSO) algorithm that introduce a solution to adaptively replace the current inactive particles with fresh particles in a way that the existing PSO-based relationships among the particles are kept <ref type="bibr">(Xie et al. 2002a, b)</ref>. In Adaptive PSO Guided by Acceleration Information (AGPSO) the concept of acceleration item was introduced in the position and velocity updating equations to improve the efficiency of PSO for finding the global optima <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Zeng et al. 2006)</ref>. Attractive Repulsive Particle Swarm Optimization (ARPSO) algorithm has been developed to remove the PSO's drawback in premature convergence. It includes an attractive phase and a repulsive phase. In the attractive phase, the addition operator is used among the equation terms for velocity updating. In the repulsive phase, the subtraction operator is employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Riget and Vesterstroem 2002)</ref>. In Trained PSO (TPSO) algorithm, the training of particle helps in reducing completion complexity and convergence time <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gheitanchi et al. 2008</ref>). In Self-Organization PSO (SOPSO) algorithm, the inclusion feedback of agent improves the performance of particle in the next iteration by improving the discovery and extract. This algorithm avoids premature convergence of total swarm <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jie et al. 2006)</ref>. In Active Target PSO (APSO) algorithm, in addition to two existing terms; namely the best position and the best previous position for particle velocity updating, a third term called 'Active target' is also utilized. Calculating the third term is complicated and it does not belong to the existing positions. This method maintains the diversity of the PSO as well as not trapping in the local optimum <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al. 2008b)</ref>. Binary PSO (BPSO)-The difference between PSO and BPSO lies in their defined searching spaces. In the BPSO moving in the spaces means a change in the probability of the fact that the value of position coordinate is zero or one <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kennedy and Eberhart 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Angle Modulated PSO (AMPSO) algorithm employs a trigonometry function to generate a bit string. Its difference with the Binary PSO (BPSO) algorithm lies in its high computational efficiency. That is, it avoids the generation of high-dimensional binary vector and thus, 123 its discretion process is not complicated. Moreover, it changes all of the high-dimensional problems to a four-dimensional problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Pampara et al. 2005)</ref>.

The PSO-Clustering algorithm can generate more compact clustering results than the K-means clustering algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fun and Chen (2005)</ref> introduced the hybrid PSO and K-means algorithm with a novel alternative metric; this is called the Alternative KPSO clustering (AKPSO) and it automatically detects the cluster centers of geometrical structure datasets.

A mountain clustering method constructs a mountain function according to the density of the sample. The improved PSO algorithm is used to find all peaks of the mountain function. The simulation results show that the MCBIPSO algorithm is successful in deciding the density clustering centers of data samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Omran et al. (2006)</ref> proposed a new dynamic clustering approach (DCPSO), based on particle swarm optimization for image segmentation. The proposed approach automatically determines the 'optimum' number of clusters and simultaneously clusters the data set with 123 minimal user interference. The algorithm starts by partitioning the data set into a relatively large number of clusters to reduce the effects of initial conditions. Using binary particle swarm optimization the "best" number of clusters is selected. The centers of the chosen clusters are then refined via the K-means clustering algorithm. The experiments show that the proposed approach generally found the optimum number of clusters on the tested images. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cui and Potok (2006)</ref> proposed a hybrid PSO based algorithm (PSO + K-means) to perform fast document clustering and to avoid being trapped in a local optimal solution as well. In this algorithm, the initial process starts by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm and then the result of the PSO is used as the initial seed of the K-means algorithm; the K-means algorithm can quickly locate the optima with a low distance average value. They reported that this hybrid PSO + K-means algorithm generated higher compact clustering than using either PSO or K-means alone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Feng et al. (2006)</ref> proposed an adaptive hyper-fuzzy partition particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm to optimally classify different geometrical structure data sets into correct groups. In this architecture, they used a hyper-fuzzy partition metric to improve the traditional commonly-used Euclidean norm metric clustering method. Since one fuzzy rule describes one pattern feature and implies the detection of one cluster center, it is encouraged that researchers decrease the number of fuzzy rules with the hyper-fuzzy partition metric. According to the adaptive particle swarm optimization, it was very suitable that they manage the clustering task for a complex, irregular, and high dimensional data set. They conclude that the proposed hyper-fuzzy PSO clustering algorithms are adaptive to outliers and achieve more accuracy than traditional K-means and fuzzy c-means clustering methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hongwen and Rui (2006)</ref> presented a neural network clustering methods-based particle swarm optimization for the large spatial datasets suitable for parallel processing. The outcome of the study clearly indicates that the proposed composite model and approach of this neural network clustering based PSO can be used as an attractive means for load characteristics to obtain the global load model for describing the nonlinear characteristics of the electric load. It will automatically produce the If-Then rules, whose premise parameters and consequent parameters are adjusted by using a Back-Propagation algorithm in combination with the least squares method. The simulation results also show the feasibility of the method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Paterlini and Krink (2006)</ref> introduced two algorithms for numerical optimization, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE).

(2007)</ref> introduced a method for clustering complex and linearly nonseparable datasets, without any prior knowledge of the number of naturally occurring clusters. The proposed method is based on an improved variant of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ahmadi et al (2007)</ref> reported that, when the data set is large and has a high dimension, the time single swarm is incapable of exploring the entire solution space. To solve such kinds of problems they proposed a multiple swarm based clustering algorithm based on the PSO. The proposed algorithm considers multiple cooperating swarms to find centers of clusters. In this algorithm a portion of the solution space is assigned to each swarm to search in that particular portion for increasing the chances of a good solution. The results of this algorithm show that it outperforms k-means clustering as well as conventional PSO-based clustering techniques. <ref type="bibr">Kao et al. (2007a)</ref> applied the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to data clustering problems. Two reflex schemes are implemented on the PSO algorithm to improve the efficiency. <ref type="bibr">Kao et al. (2007b)</ref> stated that PSO gives better clustering results, when it is applied in one dimension and for a small data set, but when it is applied to a large data set, it does not give good results. The reason behind this is that, when the search for a good solution reaches the search space boundary, the particles tend to stay there and do not move in other directions for a good solution. To overcome this problem a hybrid technique based on combining the K-means algorithm, Nelder-Mead simplex search <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nelder and Mead 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fan et al. 2004)</ref>, and particle swarm optimization, called K-NM-PSO, was proposed.

(2008)</ref> introduced a scheme for clustering complex and linearly non-separable datasets, without any prior knowledge of the number of naturally occurring groups in the data. The proposed method was based on a modified version of the classical PSO algorithm, known as the Multi-Elitist PSO (MEPSO) model. It also employs a kernel-induced similarity measure instead of the conventional sum-of-squares distance. The use of the kernel function makes it possible to cluster data that is linearly non-separable in the original input space into homogeneous groups in a transformed high-dimensional feature space. The performance of the proposed method was compared with six other clustering algorithms such as, GCUK-Genetic Clustering with an Unknown number of clusters K <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Maulik and Bandyopadhyay 2002)</ref>, the DCPSO-Dynamic Clustering PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Omran et al. 2006</ref>), an ordinary PSO based kernel-clustering method, and the kernel K-means and a kernelized version of the subtractive clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kim et al. 2005)</ref>. They concluded that the algorithm gives similar and in some cases better results than the other compared algorithms using a test-bed of five datasets. They also concluded that Euclidean distance is suitable when data is hyper spherical and linearly separable. For a nonlinear and complex data set, it does not produce good results and they observed that the final classification accuracy and the mean number of classes found by the MEPSO deteriorate considerably when the feature space dimensionality exceeds 40. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cui et al.

The first proposed technique, called Fractional Global Best Formation (FGBF), is designed to alleviate the premature convergence. The second technique called Multi-Dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization (MDPSO), is designed to achieve a dynamic clustering where the optimum number of clusters is also determined within the process. These techniques were used to find the optimal number of clusters in multidimensional data and to remove the common drawbacks of PSO family methods. <ref type="bibr">Li and Qian (2010)</ref> proposed the hybrid P-HPSO clustering algorithm and used the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to lower the data dimensionality with hybrid PSO and K-means algorithms (van der Merwe and Engelbrecht 2003) to cluster data.

It is based on multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization (MDPSO) to find out the true number of clusters and fractional global best formation (FGBF) to avoid local optima. To help professionals to quickly and accurately diagnose any latent heart disease, the proposed systematic approach produced results that were consistent with the manual labels with 99.5% average accuracy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Marini and Walczak (2011)</ref> proposed a discrete binary-coded implementation of the PSO algorithm to identify and select variables with a significant clustering tendency. In particular, to cope with the problems that can arise when performing variable selection on data sets with a high number of variables, and to account for the possibility of using the method also for purely exploratory purposes, an unsupervised approach was used, where the fitness was computed based on hierarchical clustering models. The characteristics of the method were shown on two simulated data sets and on a real megavariate data set coming from the analysis of genomic microarrays. They conclude that in all cases, PSO allowed them to explore different subspaces and to discover meaningful structures in the analyzed data. Based on these considerations, it is apparent that the use of PSO can represent a very promising option to deal with the problem of finding groups in a multivariate data set in a relatively straightforward and reliable way. This approach could be very useful to cope with biomarker identification in the fields of genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. Lotfi <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shahreza et al.

(2011)</ref> presented a particle swarm optimizer to solve the variable weighting problem in projected clustering of high-dimensional data, called PSOVW. The PSOVW employs a K-means weighting function, which calculates the sum of the within-cluster distances for each cluster along relevant dimensions preferentially to irrelevant ones. It also proposed a normalized representation of variable weights in the objective function, which greatly facilities the search process. This algorithm makes use of particle swarm optimization to get near-optimal variable weights for the given objective function. They conclude that the experimental results on synthetic and real-life datasets, including an application to document clustering, show that it can greatly improve clustering accuracy for high-dimensional data and is much less sensitive to the initial cluster centroids. Moreover, the application to text clustering shows that the effectiveness of PSOVW is not confined to Euclidean distance. The reason is that the weights are only affected by the values of the objective function and weight updating in PSOVW is independent of the similarity measure. Other similarity measures can thus be used for different applications: the extended Jaccard <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Pang-ning et al. 2006)</ref> coefficient for text data, for instance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Sun et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discussion</head><p>In the last decade, nature-inspired techniques are emerging as viable tools and alternatives to more traditional clustering techniques. Among the many nature-inspired techniques, clustering with particle swarm optimization techniques has found success in solving clustering problems. PSO can be used to find centroids of a user specified number of clusters. It is suitable for clustering complex and linearly non-separable datasets. In order to improve the efficiency of PSO algorithms, researchers have proposed different variants of the PSO algorithm and have developed new ideas such as adaptive heuristics, different fitness functions, kernel-induced similarity measures, and evolution of swarm generations etc.   The PSO still requires much investigation to improve performance and other key features that would make such algorithms suitable techniques for clustering high-dimensional data. Some future works and research trends to address the clustering of high-dimensional data are as follows: developing of multiple swarm cluster algorithms; dynamic PSO clustering algorithms; multi-objective PSO clustering algorithms; developing new fitness and measure functions; integration with feature selection and other techniques for dimensionality reduction; developing new PSO variants algorithms for feature selection phase and clustering algorithm analysis phase; developing and the use of multi distance measures; developing and the use of new similarity measures; developing and use of a multi similarity measure with multiple swarm algorithms; sensitivity analysis of PSO parameters; new strategies to find the optimal number of the clusters without any prior knowledge; and the applications to different real-world problems.</p></div>

The implementation of such algorithms for High-Dimensional Data Clustering results in better cluster formation, which finally leads to better predictions and analysis of data. Some of the reviewed algorithms based on PSO can be also applied for clustering complex and linearly non-separable datasets, without any prior knowledge of the number of clusters. A survey of the literature available in this topic has been given to provide a comprehensive insight into these topics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig.1The PSO algorithm</figDesc><graphic coords="5,106.59,193.88,226.84,174.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
