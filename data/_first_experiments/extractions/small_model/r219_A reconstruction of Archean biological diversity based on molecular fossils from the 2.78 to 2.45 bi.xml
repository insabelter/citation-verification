<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Bitumens extracted from 2.7 to 2.5 billion-year-old (Ga) shales of the Fortescue and Hamersley Groups in the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia, contain traces of molecular fossils. Based on a combination of molecular characteristics typical of many Precambrian bitumens, their consistently and unusually high thermal maturities, and their widespread distribution throughout the Hamersley Basin, the bitumens can be characterized as 'probably of Archean age'. Accepting this interpretation, the biomarkers open a new window on Archean biodiversity. The presence of hopanes in the Archean rocks confirms the antiquity of the domain Bacteria, and high relative concentrations of 2␣-methylhopanes indicate that cyanobacteria were important primary producers. Oxygenic photosynthesis therefore evolved Ͼ 2.7 Ga ago, and well before independent evidence suggests significant levels of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. Moreover, the abundance of cyanobacterial biomarkers in shales interbedded with oxide-facies banded iron formations (BIF) indicates that although some Archean BIF might have been formed by abiotic photochemical processes or anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, those in the Hamersley Group formed as a direct consequence of biological oxygen production. Biomarkers of the 3␤-methylhopane series suggest that microaerophilic heterotrophic bacteria, probably methanotrophs or methylotrophs, were active in late Archean environments. The presence of steranes in a wide range of structures with relative abundances like those from late Paleoproterozoic to Phanerozoic sediments is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean, 900 Ma before visible fossil evidence indicates that the lineage arose. Sterol biosynthesis in extant eukaryotes requires molecular oxygen. The presence of steranes together with biomarkers of oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria suggests that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in some regions of the upper water column was equivalent to at least ϳ1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) and may have been sufficient to support aerobic respiration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Microfossils, stromatolites and isotopes of sedimentary carbon and sulfur all indicate that microorganisms inhabited Earth during the Archean, the time before 2.5 billion years ago (Ga) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The fossils and isotopes also provide circumstantial evidence for the early evolution of some physiological attributes and metabolic pathways. Sedimentary organic matter strongly depleted in the carbon isotope 13 C implies the presence of archaeal methanogens and bacterial methanotrophs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hayes, 1983)</ref>, fractionated sulfide isotopes in sulfate crystals suggest the existence of mesophilic bacterial sulfate-reducers <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Shen et al., 2001)</ref>, and palimpsest filament tufts in lacustrine stromatolites are consistent with phototropic cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Buick, 1992)</ref>. However, these lines of evidence depend on chains of inference with concomitant compounding uncertainties. The oldest fossils well enough preserved to be recognized as a certain member of an extant clade only appear in the mid-Paleoproterozoic, providing diagnostic and unequivocal evidence for organisms of the phylum Cyanobacteria at 2.15 Ga <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hofmann, 1976)</ref>. The oldest remains of possible eukaryotes were discovered in iron deposits 1.87 Ga old <ref type="bibr">(Han and Run-negar, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Schneider et al., 2002)</ref>, while morphologic evidence for the domain Archaea is not known from any part of the fossil record. Therefore, the phylogenetic position of life in the Archean remains largely obscure. Potentially, a better insight into early Precambrian microbial diversity can be obtained from molecular fossils (biomarkers) preserved in sedimentary rocks.</p><p>This paper discusses the paleobiological and paleoenvironmental significance of biomarkers detected in late Archean sedimentary rocks from the Pilbara region of Western Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brocks et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., , 2003))</ref>. Biomarkers, their distribution in the Archean samples, their occurrence in other Precambrian strata and their potential biologic source will be discussed according to hydrocarbon class in the following order: normal and branched alkanes, cyclohexylalkanes, adamantanes, tricyclic terpanes, hopanes and the diverse range of steranes and steroids.</p><p>A companion paper in this issue <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., 2003)</ref> gives a detailed assessment of syngeneity of the biomarkers and addressing the possibility that the Archean host rocks were contaminated during drilling and storage, or were adulterated by migrating fluids during post-Archean history. It is concluded that adamantanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons of the Hamersley Group are 'certainly syngenetic', and aliphatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic biomarkers of the Hamersley and For-tescue Group 'probably syngenetic'. Therefore, the age of the molecules that contain the biologic information is not fully resolved. Hence, paleobiological interpretation presented in this paper should be cited cautiously and with reference to the remaining uncertainty of syngeneity <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The Interpretation of Archean Biomarkers:</head><p>Problems of an Actualistic Approach</p><p>The interpretation of Archean and Proterozoic biomarkers is complicated by two factors. One is the fragmentary knowledge of biomarker distributions across the great diversity of extant organisms and the second is the problem of how reasonable it is to extrapolate modern biomarker relationships back in time over several billion years. The biological interpretation of geolipids is almost exclusively based on the distribution of biolipids in extant organisms. However, the full biolipid repertoire is only known for a small percentage of microorganisms that have been cultured <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Volkman et al., 1993)</ref>. It is possible, therefore, that many lipids might have a broader biological distribution and more or less taxonomic value than currently known. More problematic, however, are the uncertainties associated with attributing biological sources to biomarkers from rocks several hundred million to billions of years old. Particular pathways of lipid biosynthesis, such as the modification of sterol sidechains, might have evolved independently in different lineages or could have been passed by lateral gene transfer between lineages. So lipids believed to be diagnostic of extant taxonomic groups could also have been prevalent in extinct clades.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">n-Alkanes</head><p>By far the most abundant hydrocarbons in all late Archean bitumens are n-alkanes <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., 2003)</ref>. Homologues with chain lengths from 9 to 23 carbon atoms and in one case 28 carbon atoms were detected under GC-FID (gas chromatography-flame ionization detection) conditions. The n-alkane distribution is commonly unimodal with a strong predominance of low-molecular weight homologues, a composition generally controlled by the high thermal maturity of the samples. Odd or even predominance of carbon numbers was not observed, as expected from bitumen of such high maturity.</p><p>Unbranched lipids in Recent sediments predominantly reflect input from plant waxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hedberg, 1968)</ref>, from polymethylenic biopolymers such as algaenans in eukaryotic algae <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Tegelaar et al., 1989)</ref>, and from membrane lipids in bacteria and eukaryotes such as phospholipids and sphingolipids. A plant wax source for n-alkanes can obviously be ruled out for pre-Silurian sedimentary rocks, and polymethylenic biopolymers probably played only a minor role before the Neoproterozoic <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., in press)</ref>. Straight chain lipids from bacterial and eukaryotic membrane constituents are therefore the most likely source for Archean n-alkanes.</p><p>The carbon isotopic composition of the n-alkanes (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) suggests that they were predominantly derived from heterotrophic organisms recycling photosynthetic primary products. nalkanes in all Archean bitumens are enriched in 13 C by up to 3‰ relative to pristane and phytane. This isotopic relationship is typical for many Precambrian bitumens but different from most Phanerozoic marine samples where n-Alkanes are commonly isotopically depleted relative to pristane and phytane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).

In organic matter derived from oxygenic photosynthetic primary producers the phytyl side-chain of chlorophyll, a precursor to most sedimentary pristane and phytane, is typically slightly enriched in 13 C relative to unbranched membrane lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hayes, 1993)</ref>. In the Phanerozoic, the bulk of this organic matter is transported into the sediment by rapidly sinking particles such as faecal pellets, so the original isotopic signature is preserved. This transport mechanism was absent before the Late Neoproterozoic and so the organic matter was extensively reworked as it sank slowly through the water column. As heterotrophic reworking is frequently associated with isotopic enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hayes, 1993)</ref>, straight-chain lipids contributed by the organisms at higher trophic levels become isotopically enriched relative to primary photosynthate including pristane and phytane. A similar process of isotopic enrichment by heterotrophic reworking might also be responsible for the 13 C enriched n-alkanes in the Archean bitumens. An alternative scenario, contribution of isotopically light acyclic isoprenoids by Archaea, is discussed further below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Cyclohexylalkanes</head><p>Alkanes with a terminal cyclohexyl ring were detected in low concentrations in all late Archean bitumens, with a relative distribution similar to the n-alkane profile (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Brocks et al., 2003)</ref>. Low concentrations of cyclohexylalkanes are also common in most bitumens and petroleums from the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic. Although cyclohexylalkanes could have a direct biologic source in the uncommon -cyclohexyl fatty acids isolated from some bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Suzuki et al., 1981)</ref>, the close affinity of the n-alkane and cyclohexylalkane homologue series in the Archean bitumens points to diagenetic cyclization of straight chain lipids as the most likely source <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fowler et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hoffmann et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Summons et al., 1988b)</ref>.

Isomers with all possible branching positions were detected in roughly equal concentrations with no predominance of end-or midbranched monomethylalkanes. End-branched monomethylalkanes and lower concentrations of midchain branched isomers are ubiquitous in petroleums and bitumens from the late Paleoproterozoic to the present <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Summons and Walter, 1990)</ref>. Elevated concentrations of midchain branched isomers are mainly present in Proterozoic and lower Paleozoic sediments, for example in the early Cambrian Chandler Formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Summons, 1987)</ref>, the terminal Proterozoic to Cambrian Huqf Formation of Oman <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Klomp, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ho ¨ld et al., 1999)</ref>, in Neoproterozoic oils from eastern Siberia <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fowler and Douglas, 1987)</ref> and in bitumens from the Mesoproterozoic McArthur Basin, Northern Territory <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988b)</ref>. Exceptionally high concentrations of midchain branched methylalkanes of carbon numbers Ͼ C 24 were observed in immature terminal Proterozoic microbial-mat facies <ref type="bibr">(Logan et al., 1999)</ref>. Bitumens with a non-specific isomer distribution almost identical to the Archean samples have been detected in the late Paleoproterozoic Barney Creek Formation <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988b)</ref> and Mesoproterozoic Velkerri Formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Summons et al., 1994)</ref>, McArthur Basin, Northern Territory.</p><p>Biological precursors of methylalkanes in extant organisms are widespread in the domain Bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Summons, 1987)</ref> but are also present in Eucarya <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ho ¨ld et al., 1999)</ref> and allegedly in Archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brassell et al., 1981)</ref>. In modern to Recent sediments the most common source of end-chain branched methylalkanes are 2-and 3-methylalkanoic acids prevalent in bacterial lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kaneda, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fulco, 1983)</ref>. Symbiotic bacteria living in extant demosponges produce high concentrations of end-as well as midchain branched carboxylic acids in a large variety of structural isomers in the C 15 to C 25 range <ref type="bibr">(Thiel et al., 1999a)</ref>. Midchain branched alkanes in the carbon-number range C 16 to C 18 are common in cyanobacterial mat-communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Robinson and Eglinton, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Shiea et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kenig et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ko ¨ster et al., 1999)</ref>. An additional potential source of methylalkanes in bitumen are cyclopropyl carboxylic acids that are quite common in Bacteria but are also present in some protists <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fowler and Douglas, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ho ¨ld et al., 1999, and references therein)</ref>.</p><p>In the Archean bitumens it is not clear whether the isomeric distribution of methylalkanes is representative of the original input or whether the branching positions were catagenetically 'reshuffled' to yield the observed non-specific isomer mixture. Repositioning of the methyl group along the alkane chain is not a likely mechanism <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ho ¨ld et al., 1999)</ref>, but different positional isomers can be generated by thermal cleavage of higher midchain branched alkanes at different positions <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988b)</ref>. The thermal maturity of the Archean bitumens is so high that branched alkanes Ͼ C 20 would have been almost quantitatively cracked in most samples. It is therefore impractical to attempt to reconstruct the original isomer and homologue distribution of methylalkanes. Clearly, however, biosynthetic pathways leading to branchedchain lipids were present by the late Archean. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Acyclic Isoprenoids</head><p>Most of the Archean bitumens contain C 11 to C 16 , C 18 , C 19 and C 20 acyclic isoprenoids in similar concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Brocks et al., 2003)</ref>. Acyclic isoprenoids with either 17 or Ͼ 20 carbon atoms were not detected. The carbon isotopic compositions of the C 19 and C 20 isoprenoids pristane (Pr) and phytane (Ph) are in the range ␦ 13 C Ϸ Ϫ27 to Ϫ30‰, up to 3‰ lighter than the n-alkanes. Acyclic isoprenoids with 20 or less carbon atoms are also ubiquitous in bitumens from the late Paleoproterozoic to the present <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Summons and Walter, 1990)</ref>. Higher pseudohomologues are generally less common but have been detected in Proterozoic sediments such as the 850-Ma Chuar Group, Grand Canyon, Arizona <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988a)</ref> and the 1.64-Ga Barney Creek Formation, McArthur Basin, Northern Territory <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988b)</ref>. In most younger bitumens and oils a high proportion of the acyclic isoprenoids with 20 carbon atoms or less is derived from the phytyl side chain of chlorophylls from phototrophic organisms with possible minor contributions from tocopherols and carotenoid pigments <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Volkman and Maxwell, 1986)</ref>. A second important source for acyclic isoprenoids in some environmental settings is cell membranes of Archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Moldowan and Seifert, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chappe et al., 1982)</ref>. Many Archaea synthesize diagnostic acyclic isoprenoids with Ͼ 20 and up to 40 carbon atoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brassell et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Summons, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grice et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Vink et al., 1998)</ref> but some halophiles and methanogens mainly produce shorter C 14 to C 20 pseudohomologues <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Volkman and Maxwell, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rowland, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>For the Archean bitumens, a mainly phototrophic source of acyclic isoprenoids is likely with a possible minor contribution of Յ C 20 isoprenoids from Archaea. If the presence of abundant 2␣-methylhopanes in the Archean bitumens is correctly interpreted as indicating a significant input of organic matter from cyanobacteria (see below) then the presence of phytane and lower acyclic isoprenoids can be attributed to degradation products of chlorophyll. In addition, the isotopic composition of pristane and phytane is consistent with oxygenic photosynthetic carbon assimilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Schidlowski et al., 1983)</ref>. The carbon isotopic depletion of both pristane and phytane relative to n-alkanes by up to 3‰ could reflect a contribution of isotopically depleted membrane lipids from methanogenic Archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Rowland, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Summons et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thiel et al., 1999b)</ref>. However, the more diagnostic isotopic fingerprint of methanogens with phytane markedly depleted in 13 C relative to pristane <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Murray et al., 1998)</ref> was not detected in any sample. A significant contribution of Յ C 20 isoprenoids by thermal degradation of higher Archaeal pseudohomologues can also be ruled out, since random cleavage of higher acyclic isoprenoids creates a whole set of lower pseudohomologues including C 17 , C 21 and above. The absence of C 17 and C 20 ϩ pseudohomologs, on the other hand, is consistent with thermal degradation of regular C 20 isoprenoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Haug and Curry, 1974)</ref>. Therefore, the acyclic isoprenoids in the Archean bitumens are predominantly derived from phototrophic organisms with a possible contribution of Ͻ C 21 isoprenoids from Archaea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Adamantanes</head><p>Adamantanes and diamantanes have no known direct biologic precursors. However, they are of interest here because they represent the only saturated hydrocarbons of absolutely unequivocal Archean age <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., 2003)</ref>. Moreover, adamantanes are believed to be derived from thermal rearrangement of biomarkers such as tricyclic terpanes, steranes and hopanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen et al., 1996)</ref>. As such, they could indicate the presence of complex, polycyclic lipids in the Archean shales even if other biomarkers were non-indigenous. However, it is also conceivable that adamantanes in the Archean bitumens formed as the result of enhanced thermal degradation of non-lipid organic matter. Therefore, it is currently not possible to obtain biologic information from Archean adamantanes.</p></div>

However, a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwood et al.

These authors performed laser pyrolysis GC-MS on isolated and preextracted specimens of the fossil alga Tasmanites and detected C 19 to C 28 -cheilanthanes evidently derived from the algal biomass. Although cheilanthanes might have multiple sources, direct evidence for this assumption does not exist. A more reliable biologic interpretation of cheilanthanes in the Archean bitumens will become possible once extant precursor organisms have been discovered.</p></div>

Although hopanoid biosynthesis does not require oxygen, it is of some interest that they are generally not present in obligate anaerobes <ref type="bibr">(Rohmer et al., 1984)</ref>. The most abundant hopanoids in bacterial membranes are C 35 -bacteriohopanepolyols that carry an extended polyhydroxylated or otherwise functionalized side chain. All bacteria that synthesize C 35 -bacteriohopanepolyols also contain lower concentrations of the C 30 -hopanoids diploptene and diplopterol.</p><p>While Archaea do not produce hopanoids <ref type="bibr">(Ourisson et al., 1987)</ref>, they are present in some Eucarya <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Rohmer et al., 1992)</ref> such as cryptogams, ferns, mosses, lichens, filamentous fungi and, in very low concentrations, in protists of the genus Tetrahymena.

The C 27 to C 35 -hopanes found in post-Archean bitumens and oils are mostly produced by the diagenetic and catagenetic degradation of C 35 -bacteriohopanepolyols and so the patterns of hopanes in the Archean bitumens also can be confidently assigned to bacteria.</p><p>Taxonomic information below domain level can be extracted from the patterns of hopanes methylated at ring-A. All Archean bitumens contain the series of C 29 to C 36 -2␣-methyl-␣␤-hopanes in high relative concentrations in comparison to Phanerozoic samples. C 36 -hopanepolyols methylated at C-2 are common and abundant membrane constituents in extant cyanobacteria and prochlorophytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rohmer et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Simonin et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Summons et al., 1999)</ref>.

C 31 -MHI is frequently high (Ͼ10%) in sedimentary rocks from playa and saline lakes and in settings of carbonate and evaporite precipitation, environments known to support the growth of cyanobacterial mats. C 31 -MHI in clastic Phanerozoic sediments is commonly low (ϳ0 to 9%) while it frequently exceeds 10% in Proterozoic shales <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Summons et al., 1999)</ref>, suggesting that the generally elevated abundance of 2␣-methylhopanes in the Precambrian might be explained by an increased component of cyanobacterial primary production. Notably, C 31 -MHI of the Archean bitumens is also predominantly Ͼ 10% with some as high as 20%. Even higher than C 31 -MHI in all Archean samples are the 2␣-methylhopane indices of the C 32 homolog, a biomarker exclusively generated by cyanobacteria. Thus, these high indices are consistent with an important role for cyanobacteria as primary producers in the late Archean.</p><p>The 3␤-methylhopane series (C 31 to C 36 -3␤-methyl-␣␤-hopanes) represents a second set of A-ring methylated hopanes detected in Archean bitumen <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., 2003)</ref>.

Although the biologic source and geochemical significance of 3␤-methylhopanes in bitumens and oils is not as well constrained as the 2␣-methylhopanes, a methanotrophic source for 3␤-methylhopanes in the Archean bitumens is plausible, especially in view of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hayes's (1983)</ref> hypothesis concerning the role of methanotrophy to explain the late Archean negative carbon isotope extremes that are found world-wide.

A series of weak signals was tentatively identified as C 29 to C 34 -17␣(H)-diahopanes (17␣(H)-15␣-methyl-27-norhopanes). The diahopane skeleton is derived from the hopane structure by the shift of a methyl group from C-14 to C-15. Direct biologic precursors of diahopanes have not yet been identified and it is almost certain that diahopanes are exclusively formed by diagenetic rearrangement of regular hopanoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Moldowan et al., 1991)</ref>. A second group of modified hopanes in the Archean samples are the C 27 and C 29 -neohopanes 18␣(H)-22,29,30-trisnorneohopane (Ts) and 18␣(H),21␤(H)-30-norneohopane (C 29 Ts).

This envisages globally elevated rates of methanogenesis with reintroduction of isotopically depleted methane-derived carbon into the kerogen reservoir by methanotrophic activity. Consistent with methanotrophic activity in the late Archean is the presence of 3␤-methylhopanes in the bitumens, and methano-genesis is potentially indicated by acyclic isoprenoids. However, the apparent absence of isotopically depleted n-alkanes appears difficult to reconcile with the methanogen/methanotroph hypothesis. In the Mt McRae Shale and Brockman Iron Formation, Hamersley Group, n-alkanes are enriched in 13 C relative to kerogen by 2 to 6‰ and in the upper Fortescue Group and lowermost Hamersley Group by 11 to 21‰ (Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>However, a simple quantitative model based on two groups of organisms with different isotopic compositions demonstrates that the co-occurrence of isotopically very light kerogens with isotopically heavier lipids is possible and potentially consistent with the methanogen/methanotroph hypothesis. In this model L organisms biosynthesize isotopically light organic matter (␦ 13 C L ) while H organisms contribute isotopically heavy biomass to kerogen and bitumen (␦ 13 C H ). It is assumed that lipid and non-lipid biomass in each group has approximately the same isotopic composition and that isotopic shifts during transition to mature kerogen are negligible.

The isotopic difference is 9.5‰, similar to values found in most late Archean kerogen/bitumen pairs.

The resulting isotopic kerogen/ bitumen difference is 18.2‰, equivalent to the highest values in the Archean samples. Also, the transition from ␦ 13 C kerogen ϭ Ϫ37‰ to Ϫ48‰ leads, in the model, to a decrease in ␦ 13 C n-alkanes of only ϳ2‰. In the Archean samples a system- atic variation of ␦ 13 C n-alkanes with ␦ 13 C kerogen of ϳ2‰ was not observed (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), probably because such a small isotopic fluctuation would have been masked by in situ mixing of gas-condensates.</p><p>The main factor that determines the carbon isotopic difference between kerogen and bitumen is x, and the existence of mechanisms causing values as high as x ϭ 10 is crucial for the validity of the above model. Four biologic mechanisms can be considered:</p><p>1. x will be high when H organisms produce a higher proportion of lipids relative to total biomass than L organisms. A lipid content of 20% in H organisms and 2.4% in L organisms would result in x Ϸ 10. These values are plausible as such differences in lipid contents have frequently been ob-4327 Reconstruction of Archean biological diversity based on molecular fossils served in extant organisms. For example, the cyanobacterium Nostoc carneum contains ϳ22% lipids in its total dry cell mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kohlhase and Pohl, 1988)</ref> whereas the methanogen Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum apparently has only 2.8% <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Rowland, 1990)</ref>. 2. A high x value also results when lipid material of H organisms is less prone to biologic reworking or other forms of degradation than lipids of L organisms. The highly resistant and lipid-rich algaenans from some extant algae are the best example of such a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Tegelaar et al., 1989)</ref>. However, pyrolysis experiments indicate that input of macromolecular lipids into late Archean kerogens was probably low <ref type="bibr">(Brocks et al., 2003b)</ref> and this mechanism is therefore less likely than the following explanation. 3. Very high x values could occur when L organisms synthesize biodegradation-resistant non-lipid macromolecules. Such resistant biomacromolecules might become enriched during diagenesis by two to three orders of magnitude relative to other organic matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Tegelaar et al., 1989)</ref>. To explain the isotopically light Archean kerogens in combination with isotopically heavy bitumen, L organisms would have to preferentially generate non-degradable non-lipid organic matter such as recalcitrant cell wall material. 4. x might increase if organic matter from H organisms is exposed to oxidizing conditions for a longer period than organic matter from L organisms. Lipids usually become gradually enriched during biodegradation, as protein-and carbohydrate-derived organic matter is consumed first. Isotopically heavy lipids from phototrophic organisms might then become concentrated as their dead biomass sinks slowly through the upper oxygenated part of a stratified water column. The isotopically light dead biomass from microaerophilic L organisms, on the other hand, is less exposed to oxygen, travels shorter distances to its final sedimentary sink and experiences a lower degree of recycling. Thus, isotopically heavy lipids might become more enriched relative to total biomass than isotopically light lipids.</p><p>Although other mechanisms might have been responsible for the carbon isotopic disparities between the late Archean kerogens and bitumens, the simple model presented above demonstrates that a biologic explanation is plausible. It also shows that the isotopic data are in principle consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hayes's (1983)</ref> hypothesis of global methanotrophy. The exact source of the isotopically light organic matter in the kerogens is as yet unresolved but significant information about Archean biology may reside in its solution. It might be possible to detect the 13 C depleted source by measuring carbon isotopic compositions of individual hopanes and steranes. However, this will only become feasible with the discovery of Archean bitumens with higher biomarker concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RECONSTRUCTION OF LATE ARCHEAN BIODIVERSITY</head><p>To reconstruct the late Archean biosphere, biomarker data should be viewed in the context of current paleontological knowledge. The following section reviews fossil and isotope evidence for the antiquity of the three domains of life-Bacteria, Archaea and Eucarya-and discusses new knowledge provided by Archean biomarkers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Domain Bacteria</head><p>Life has existed on Earth for probably Ͼ 3.5 Ga <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buick et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Rosing, 1999)</ref>. Thus, as the domain Bacteria forms a fundamental branch on the Tree of Life (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Woese et al., 1990)</ref>, an origin for the clade early in the Archean seems likely. However, the oldest unquestionable morphologic evidence for bacteria does not appear in the fossil record until 2.15 Ga <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hofmann, 1976)</ref>. Accepting the syngeneity of the biomarkers discussed in this paper, the presence of hopanes is the first unequivocal testimony for the domain Bacteria in the Archean.</p><p>As bacteriohopanol biosynthesis occurs in a wide range of phylogenetically unrelated bacterial taxa, regular desmethylhopanes are not diagnostic below domain level <ref type="bibr">(Ourisson et al., 1987)</ref>. However, taxonomic information can be obtained from hopanes carrying an additional methyl group at ring-A. 2␣methylhopanes with an extended side chain are diagnostic biomarkers for cyanobacteria, and 3␤-methylhopanes are consistent with methanotrophs, methylotrophs or acetic acid teria.</p></div>

Independently of this, the side-chain degradation pattern of the C 30 to C 36 2␣-methylhopane homologous series relative to the corresponding C 30 to C 36 3␤-methylhopanes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>) suggests that late Archean cyanobacteria lived in an oxygenated micro-environment. The C 30 to C 36 2␣-methylhopane series has in all analyzed samples a characteristic even-overodd carbon number predominance. The elevated abundance of the C 32 -homologue relative to C 31 and C 33 indicates oxidative side-chain cleavage of a bacteriohopanetetrol to a C 33 carboxylic acid and subsequent decarboxylation under non-reducing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Peters and Moldowan, 1991)</ref>. This process almost certainly required molecular oxygen (3␤-methylhopanes, used as reference compounds for the methylhopane plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, are derived from organisms that preferentially inhabit suboxic conditions and are less affected by this type of oxidative side chain fragmentation). Therefore, the prevalence of the oxidative degradation pattern in 2␣-methylhopanes together with the absolute abundance of these biomarkers is testimony for biogenic oxygen production at 2.7 Ga, ϳ700 Ma before significant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Holland and Beukes, 1990)</ref>. One major sink for the excreted oxygen was probably reduced iron, and cyanobacterial biomarkers are indeed abundant in shales interbedded with oxide-facies banded iron formations (BIF) of the Hamersley Group. So, although BIF could in principle have been formed by abiotic photochemical processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Braterman et al., 1983)</ref> or by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Widdel et al., 1993)</ref>, those in the Hamersley Group probably formed as a result of photosynthetic oxygen production <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brocks et al., 1999)</ref>. As bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis in anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria evidently evolved before chlorophyll biosynthesis in cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Xiong et al., 2000)</ref>, the 2␣-methylhopanes also provide indirect evidence that the four lineages of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria-heliobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and green nonsulfur bacteria-were probably also extant by 2.7 Ga (Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Marais, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Methanotrophs</head><p>There is no visible fossil evidence of the existence of methanotrophic bacteria in the Archean or, indeed, in any other period. However, the global negative carbon isotopic anomaly of kerogen during the late Archean may be indirect evidence for the existence of methanotrophs by 2.8 Ga. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hayes (1983)</ref>, isotopically light methane generated by methanogens was incorporated into the sedimentary record by methanotrophs. As isotopically light kerogens occurred globally and the excursion extended for Ͼ 100 Ma, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hayes (1994)</ref> coined the term "Age of Methanotrophs" to describe the late Archean. Although the methanogen-methanotroph hypothesis is persuasive, the carbon isotopic excursion does not provide information about the taxonomic affinity of the methane recyclers. However, evidence that they were related to extant methanotrophic bacteria is now provided by the presence of the 3␤methylhopane series in the late Archean bitumens. However, 3-methylhopanoids have also been isolated from methylotrophic and acetic acid bacteria and may exist in other, as yet unknown, groups. Also, enhanced methane recycling by organisms related to extant methanotrophs should have left significant concentrations of isotopically light lipids. A continuing search for confirmation of methanotrophic activity should be focussed on the detection of 13 C-depleted hopanoids and other lipids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Domain Archaea</head><p>Although fossils of Archaea should be morphologically indistinguishable from most Bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Summons and Walter, 1990)</ref>, the two domains generate substantially different biomarkers. Acyclic isoprenoids with between 20 and 40 carbon atoms and distinct modes of isoprenoid linking are diagnostic for the Archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brassell et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Summons, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grice et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Vink et al., 1998)</ref>. Shorter C 14 to C 20 -isoprenoids are also abundant in some halophiles and methanogens but they are frequently not distinguishable from degradation products of the phytyl side chain of chlorophylls <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Volkman and Maxwell, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rowland, 1990)</ref>. The late Archean bitumens only contain acyclic isoprenoids with Ͻ 21 carbon atoms. So, although a contribution from Archaea cannot be excluded, these acyclic isoprenoids are more probably derived from phototrophic organisms (see section 2.4.). The only indirect geochemical evidence for Archaea in the Archean is the global occurrence of kerogens strongly depleted in 13 C at ϳ2.8 to ϳ2.5 Ga which, according to the 'Age of Methanotrophs' hypothesis (see section 3.1.2 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hayes, 1994)</ref>, should have ultimately resulted from Archaeal methanogenesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Domain Eucarya</head><p>Body fossils attributed to eukaryotes have never been recorded in rocks of Archean age. The oldest fossils proposed to have eukaryotic affinity are 1.87 Ga old <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Schneider et al., 2002)</ref> carbonaceous compressions of filaments with a diameter of up to 30 mm (Grypania) from the Negaunee Iron Formation, Michigan (node | in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Han and Runnegar, 1992</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Samuelsson and Butterfield, 2001</ref>, questioning the eukaryotic nature of these structures) and spheromorphic acritarchs <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Zhang, 1986)</ref> and large compressed disks and filaments (Hofmann and Chen, 1981) from the ϳ1.8 to 1.9 Ga Chuanlinggou Formation, China. Molecular evidence diagnostic of eukaryotes comes from sterane biomarkers in bitumen of the ϳ1.64-Ga Barney Creek Formation (node } in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Summons et al., 1988b)</ref>, and the oldest fossils that are demonstrably eukaryotic come from shales of the 1.49 to 1.43 Ga Roper Group, McArthur Basin, Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Javaux et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Javaux et al., , 2003))</ref>. In comparison to older fossils, Roper protists have a higher diversity and exhibit the features of processes, wall ornamentation and probable excystment structures. The oldest eukaryotic fossils that can be assigned with confidence to an extant phylum are rhodophyte algae from the 1.26 to 0.95 Ga Hunting Formation, Somerset Island, Canada (node ~in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Butterfield et al., 1990)</ref>. However, the lack of fossils with diagnostic eukaryotic morphology in rocks older than ϳ1.9 Ga is not evidence for the absence of Eucarya in the Archean. Eukaryote microfossils are usually preserved in shales, which in Archean terrains are almost always metamorphosed and deformed, limiting the likelihood of their survival even if they were already extant. Furthermore, modern eukaryotes occupying lower branches on the phylogenetic tree lack degradation-resistant structures, making it reasonable to assume that any eukaryotes in the Archean would also have had a low potential for preservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Knoll, 1992)</ref>. Archean Eucarya also might have inhabited environments unfavorable for fossilization. Further, the probability that the characteristic ultrastructures of eukaryotic cells would be preserved in metamorphosed Archean rocks is extremely low, in which case fossils of small ancestral eukaryotes would be difficult to distinguish from prokaryotes. Indeed, small body-size may have been a common phenomenon in Archean and early Paleoproterozoic eukaryotes, as small diffusion distances can potentially compensate for a limited oxygen supply before ϳ1.9 Ga. So, the absence of Archean microfossils with familiar eukaryotic morphology should not be unexpected and cannot be used to rule out the early appearance of eukaryotes. However, indirect evidence for the existence of eukaryotes before 2.5 Ga has been drawn from the global carbon isotopic excursion of kerogens in the late Archean <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Han and Runnegar, 1992)</ref>. As previously mentioned, the isotopically light kerogens are best explained by widespread methanogenic activity and incorporation of isotopically depleted methane-derived carbon into the sedimentary record <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hayes, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hayes, , 1994))</ref>. Large-scale methane generation points to the existence of methanogenic Archaea. As Archaea and Eucarya evidently shared a common ancestor <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Woese et al., 1990)</ref>, this would suggest that stem group eukaryotes existed by the late Archean <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Han and Runnegar, 1992</ref>; for an alternative view see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lake, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Accepting an Archean age for the bitumens studied here, the presence of steranes therein is the first direct evidence for the existence of eukaryotes so early in Earth history (node { in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brocks et al., 1999)</ref>. Although a wide variety of sterane biomarkers are present, they do not provide any taxonomic information below domain level (see section 2.8.). Thus the phylogenetic position of the late Archean eukaryotes remains obscure. It is, for example, unclear whether late Archean Eucarya had acquired mitochondria and chloroplasts or even whether key attributes like a cytoskeleton or nucleus were present. However, one key characteristic, sterol biosynthesis, had evidently already developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Constraints on Late Archean Oxygen Levels</head><p>Atmospheric oxygen levels in the late Archean were much lower than at present <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kasting, 1993)</ref> and almost certainly Ͻ 1% PAL (present atmospheric level) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Rasmussen and Buick, 1999)</ref>. However, the Archean bitumens contain evidence that the photic zone of the water column was at least weakly oxygenated:</p><p>1. The bitumens contain molecular fossils of bacteriohopanoids. Although hopanoid biosynthesis does not require oxygen, these lipids have never been isolated from strict anaerobes <ref type="bibr">(Ourisson et al., 1987)</ref>. 2. The Archean shales also contain high relative concentrations of cyanobacterial 2␣-methylhopanes. These biomarkers are indirect evidence for oxygen release within the photic zone. 3. The side-chain degradation pattern of the 2␣-methylhopane series (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>) indicates oxic conditions during earliest diagenesis of cyanobacterial organic matter. 4. The bitumens contain molecular fossils of sterols. Sterol biosynthesis in extant eukaryotes requires dissolved oxygen in concentrations equivalent to ϳ1% PAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jahnke and Klein, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>The concentration of oxygen in Archean surface waters was thus probably high enough to allow aerobic respiration, as the Pasteur point at which aerobic respiration is favored over fermentation is ϳ1% PAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chapman and Schopf, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>However, an O 2 level equivalent to ϳ1% PAL in the upper water column does not necessarily indicate an oxygenated atmosphere. Oxygen diffusing into the atmosphere would have been quickly scavenged by reduced biotic and volcanic gases, and oxygen mixed into the underlying anoxic water mass would have been consumed by reduced species of hydrothermal and detrital origin. But the loss of biogenic oxygen from surface waters to the atmosphere and to underlying anoxic water is a comparatively slow process. Depending on maximum rates of planktonic oxygen generation in the late Archean, up to 8% PAL oxygen might have accumulated locally in the photic zone in an otherwise anoxic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kasting, 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Reconstruction of a Late Archean Open Water Ecosystem</head><p>The late Archean sedimentary rocks studied in this work were mostly deposited in marine environments below storm wave base in oxygen-deficient water. The water column within the photic zone was evidently mildly oxygenated (ϳ1% PAL) but oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere were probably well below this level. The photic zone was inhabited by oxygen-producing cyanobacteria, aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and eukaryotes of unknown physiology. The transition zone between oxic and anoxic water was inhabited by philic heterotrophic bacteria, possibly including methanotrophs. Diagnostic biomarker evidence for organisms living under anoxic conditions was not obtained but the low 13 C contents of kerogen indirectly suggests activity of methanogenic Archaea.</p><p>Particulate organic matter was extensively reworked as it sank slowly through the water column. Because reworking conditions in the photic zone were oxidizing, straight-chain lipids from primary producers were extensively degraded and replaced by secondary isotopically enriched lipids, leading to an inverted carbon isotopic relationship between acyclic isoprenoids and n-alkanes. However, the presence of kerogen in the Archean rocks indicates that reduced organic carbon was evidently exported to the bottom sediment and, therefore, that excess oxygen was generated. The excess oxygen was subsequently consumed in sinks such as reduced volcanic gases, reduced hydrothermal metals and reduced terrigenous sedimentary detritus. Given the abundant occurrence of cyanobacterial biomarkers within banded iron formation, it appears that Fe oxidation constituted a substantial oxygen sink at this time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
