<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Accumulating evidence has reported that the gut microbiota could play important roles in the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer. The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. † Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a serious global public health concern, as worldwide, it is the second most common cancer in women, and the third most common in men. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Epidemiological studies have suggested that the disease could be caused by the consumption of high quantities of processed meat (western diet), providing an imbalance between dietary intake and energy expenditure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Therefore, greater attention has been paid to natural plant products as potential sources of functional ingredients, with potential anti-colon cancer activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> More recently, the relationship between colon cancer and intestinal flora or their metabolites has gained considerable tractions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> In the human gastrointestinal tract, the vast majority of microbes form stable microbial ecosystems, playing important roles in the development and life-long maintenance of host health. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> These microbes not only digest food and produce key metabolites, but they also enhance the immune functions. They could regulate disordered intestinal microorganisms associated with CRC and metabolic syndromes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The disrupted composition of gut microbiota in high fat, high meat, and low dietary fiber diets could lead to metabolic endotoxemia, inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease and CRC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Recent research has indicated significant intestinal flora differences between normal and CRC individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Especially, there were increases adverse bacteria, including Fusobacteria, Porphyromonadaceae, Coriobacteridae, and beneficial microorganisms, including Methanobacteriales whereas Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium spp. diminished as well as Roseburia and Treponema in CRC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Additionally, CRC-reduction may be achieved by balancing the diet and manipulating the microbiota. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> Recent studies have indicated that dietary fiber and plant polysaccharide-rich sources could modulate intestinal microbiota in vivo, promoting the proliferation and diversity of beneficial bacteria in the gut. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> Thus, the development of an effective dietary regimen could have huge significance for the prevention of CRC.</p><p>In China, jujube fruit are generally recognized as valuable sources of biologically active compounds, possessing higher nutritional and pharmacological effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> Dried jujube has been commonly used as a food, a food additive, a flavoring and also as a traditional Chinese medicine used for thousands of years. It has been claimed that the jujube has a wide range of health benefits, with anti-obesity, anti-epileptic, anti-insomnia, neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Jujube based polysaccharides are the most abundant component of the fruit, and could be responsible for its chemo-preventive properties (e.g. immunomodulation, antioxidant, antitumor, hepatoprotective and hypoglycemic activities and gastrointestinal-protective effects). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> In a previous report, orally administered JP effectively shortened gastrointestinal transit time, reduced caecum ammonia levels, elevated total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the cecum, increased fecal moisture and reduced daily fecal ammonia outputs from feces, in different intestinal and fecal indices in a hamster model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> Interestingly, we recently observed that wild jujube polysaccharides protected mice against experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease by enhancing intestinal barrier functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> In addition, our previous studies have also suggested that Muzao polysaccharides benefitted the stability of certain gut microbiota, especially under environmentally triggered microbial imbalance, where azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) were used to induce a CRC mice model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> The biotransformation of plant polysaccharides has been extensively investigated in gut microbiota, suggesting that metabolic and colonic microbiota transformation could enhance dietary oligosaccharide bioactivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> While, it has been shown that polysaccharides could relieve the occurrence of colon cancer in rats by modulating certain genes, the potential mechanisms in preventing gut dysbiosis and anti-CRC are complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Recently, metagenomic based molecular techniques were widely used to identify rare and unculturable bacterial communities, as well as identifying functional genes enriched by external intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> In this study, male C57BL/6 mice were induced to develop colitis-associated colon cancer by AOM, a carcinogen and DSS, a proinflammatory reagent. Once established, this cancer induced mice were orally administrated with JP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> These mice feces were determined by high-throughput sequencing, and genes enriched in several metabolic pathways were investigated in the gut microbiome.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Influence of JP on mouse body weight and colon length</head><p>To examine the effects of JP in the CRC mouse model, the mutagen AOM was used to initiate colon tumors, followed by a triple dose of DSS to induce chronic inflammation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Mice receiving normal saline alone were used as a control group. After AOM/DSS treatment, mice were orally administrated 1000 mg kg -1 JP once a day for 13 weeks. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, significant body weight loss was observed in AOM/DSS induced mice when compared with the control group. This was significantly alleviated by JP treatment by the end of the study. These observations were similar to a previous study where it was shown that a Rhizopus nigricans polysaccharide increased the weight of AOM/DSS treated mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> Tumor formation was analyzed at the end of the study. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, in the absence of JP treatment, AOM/DSSinduced mice exhibited a high tumor burden in their colons, while JP treatment markedly reduced AOM/DSS-induced </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food &amp; Function Paper</head><p>tumors. These results agreed with a previous study reporting that wild JP inhibited tumor growth in an AOM/DSS-induced CRC model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> Moreover, decreased colon length was observed in AOM/DSS-induced mice when compared with control mice. Such a significant length decrease was subsequently relieved by JP treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of colon tissues was performed to analyze the pathology of AOM/ DSS-induced colons. The results showed that JP decreased the number and sizes of tumors and provided protection against the AOM/DSS-induced dysplasia/adeno-carcinoma lesion via surface tumor necrosis. These data indicated that JP exhibited strong suppressive effects on colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis induced by AOM/DSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> </p></div>

The flat curves of the base sequence and mass distribution demonstrated higher accuracy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1a †</ref>).</p><p>Using MEGAHIT software to assemble effective reads, the default length of KMER should be 21, 41, 61, 81, 99, and the length of contigs could exceed 600 in each group when the sum value reaches 90% of the total length of fragment (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> †). Using the ReefSeq database in NCBI, fecal microbial genes were indexed and the species annotated using Meta-Othello. The species annotation and abundance information for each sample were counted, and a species abundance information table obtained in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Among the classifiable sequences in different groups, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were represented the dominant lineages in the samples. To better understand the shared richness of each group, a Venn diagram displaying overlaps between groups was produced. This approach showed that a total richness of 1 579 444 OTUs was shared among all samples in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1c</ref>. † These data demonstrated that approximately 43.68% of OTUs were reduced after AOM/DSS-treated mice were fed JP, suggesting that JP decreased microbial community diversity and pathogenic bacteria levels, but increased probiotic diversity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> In keeping with our previous observations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> the most abundant phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Ascomycota and Bacteroidetes in different groups of mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The most abundant phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Ascomycota and Bacteroidetes in different groups of mice. Other phyla were represented in relatively lower abundances; Mucoromycota, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria and a number of unclassified bacteria. After JP treatment, there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, while there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes. In addition, the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes (B/F) increased from 0.27 (M) to 0.39 (JP). To investigate fecal microbiota communities in the different mouse groups, a family level analysis was performed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). At this level, the following families showed an increasing trend during JP treatment: Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Debaryomycetaceae (P &lt; 0.05). Lactobacillaceae was the dominant beneficial bacteria at the family level during JP treatment, their relative abundance increased significantly from 0.010 to 0.017 at the </p></div>

The relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae showed a similar trend, which reached 0.022 in the JP group after 13 weeks from 0.015 in the M group. Herpotrichiellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Aspergillaceae and Lachnospiraceae families showed less abundance after JP intervention, at 13 weeks.</p><p>Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes abundance were similar at the phylum level. At deeper taxonomic levels, more significant differences were observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). Bar graphs showed genera at different levels in samples; Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were increased when fed JP for 13 weeks. Significant reductions were observed in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, Spirochaetes and Mucoromycota. Bar graphs showed genera at different levels in samples; Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were increased when fed JP for 13 weeks. Significant reductions were observed in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, Spirochaetes and Mucoromycota. Our data indicated that intesti-nal dysbiosis by AOM/DSS was extensively alleviated by JP treatment, and that certain genera belonging to two predominant phyla may be used as distinguishing biomarkers. Despite high inter-individual variability after JP intervention for 13 weeks, Firmicutes were significantly less abundant, while Bacteroidetes were significantly more abundant in fecal microbiota, when compared to the M group. To measure the similarity between microbial communities, principal coordinate analysis, principal co-ordinates analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses were performed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1b †</ref>). Despite significant inter-individual variation, the fecal microbiota from AOM/ DSS-induced mice, fed with JP were separated clearly by these different analytical methods.</p></div>

In addition, KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes between C and M groups, C and JP groups (data not shown, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 †</ref>) were mainly enriched in two-component system, after JP supplementation for 13 weeks. Although the ranking varied in different groups, the numbers of differentially expressed genes were dramatically changed within the different groups.</p><p>The GO database provides three different types of systematic definition for describing the different functions of gene products. GO functions include biological processes, cellular components and molecular function. Biological processes consist of molecular functions with multiple steps; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> cellular components refer to gene products located in cellular orga-nelles, while molecular functions describe molecular biological activities, such as catalytic and binding activities. For each GO function, we selected seven of the largest GO terms.

Cellular components included membranes, cells, cell parts and membrane parts; and molecular functions included catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food &amp; Function Paper</head><p>The human gut has been viewed as a bioreactor, where interactions between plant polysaccharides and gut microbiota occur. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients, mostly oligosaccharides, which benefit the host by stimulating the growth and/or activity of specific intestinal bacteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> It has been reported that certain plant polysaccharides, with prebiotic-like activities, have major influences on gut microbial profiles and helps reestablish healthy intestinal microbial communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> In our previous study, JP exhibited similar proliferative effects, in combination with fructo-oligosaccharides, on the growth of beneficial bacteria, including Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus/Enterococcus groups. Furthermore, they displayed inhibitory effects on Enterorhabdus, Odoribacter, Ruminiclostridium, Anaerotruncus, and Blautia groups, and appeared to decrease total bacterial numbers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> It has been reported Herpotrichiellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Aspergillaceae and Lachnospiraceae could promote tumorigenesis, whereas Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus/Enterococcus could degrade macromolecular plant polysaccharides and have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> By using the AOM/DSS mouse model, we also investigated the modulatory effects of JP on intestinal microbiota. JP showed significant protective effects against AOM/DSSinduced CRC, and a strong activity in regulating dysbiosis and maintaining a balanced microbial ecology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the main bacterial groups involved in the colonic metabolism of undigested plant polysaccharides, where they use a complex metabolic energy-harvesting mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> It is widely believed that an increased ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes can prevent the development of CRC in both dietary and genetic mouse CRC models in regulating the gut microbiota following the JP treatments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> The increased abundance of Bacteroides has been reported to be associated with immunosuppression and carcinogenesis. The AOM and DSS feeding may not only affect gut morphology, mucin production, gut permeability and SCFA production, but also promote bacterial dysbacteriosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> In this study, a large decrease in Firmicutes, with an expansion in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was observed in our CRC mouse model, upon JP intervention. These results were consistent with previous reports suggesting that Firmicutes are largely repressed by plant polysaccharides and their metabolites, thus tilting the balance towards Bacteroidetes in the gut. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> Dietary polysaccharides could cause variations in specific microorganism populations, whereas microbial conversion of polysaccharides affects other colonic pathways and processes, such as SCFA production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> SCFA production is a metabolic consequence of intestinal microbiota. Their ratios and concentrations are dramatically influenced by gut flora and the diet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> With elevated fecal SCFA concentrations, SCFAproducing bacteria could promote energy intake from plant polysaccharides, and prevent host colonic diseases e.g. CRC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> Increased generation of acids, upon fermentation, is considered desirable, as acidic colonic environments protect against pathogenic bacteria and are helpful towards mineral absorption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> High levels of acetic acid may be correlated with the metabolic activities of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Enterococcus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> In this study, at the phylum level, Bacteroides were dramatically increased upon JP intervention, which may be correlated with the production of acetic acid. Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, which are strongly correlated with butyrate production, also counterbalance the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> In our study, their relative abundance was decreased, along with the intake of JP. Recently, a metagenomic study suggested that butyric acid is not predictable at the family level of bacterial taxonomy, but may be predictable at the genus level or deeper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> It is known that butyric acid-producing bacteria belong to the phylum Firmicutes, but other phyla may have potential candidates, such as the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> As is well-known, SCFA is the main end product of carbohydrate metabolism, which can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and protect the intestine from colitis and colorectal cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> Indeed, most taxa correlated positively with the fecal concentrations of butyric acid and were from the phylum Firmicutes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> The production of butyric acid occurs at the later stages of fermentation, indicating it may be correlated with the transformation of other bacterial metabolites formed during this fermentation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> The production of butyric acid occurs at the later stages of fermentation, indicating it may be correlated with the transformation of other bacterial metabolites formed during this fermentation. However, the corresponding pathways and underlying mechanisms must be studied further using integrative genomic technologies.</p><p>An expanding body of preclinical evidence suggests the potential of JP on a variety of human diseases involving signal transduction pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> Therefore, this nontoxic natural agent could be extremely useful, either alone or in combination with conventional therapeutics for the prevention of human chronic disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> In terms of anti-colon cancer activities, previous studies have suggested that the positive impact of JP could be from its ability to suppress chronic inflammation and oxidative stress damage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> However, the effects of JP on CRC mechanisms remain unclear. At present, next-generation sequencing platforms provide opportunities to explore taxonomic, protein-coding gene or protein expression diversities, by applying more comprehensive and less biased measurements to the diet, microbiota and the host. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> The approach has provided new information on the diversity and composition of human gut microbiota. The influence of plant polysaccharides on bacterial growth and metabolism depends on polysaccharide structure, the dose assayed and the microorganism strain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> Recent findings have suggested a variety of potential mechanisms for plant polysaccharides acting on bacteria. For example, plant polysaccharides and/or oligosaccharide could bind to bacterial cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner, thus disturbing membrane function and inhibiting cell growth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial membrane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial</p></div>

For the imputed relative abundances of KEGG pathways at different groups, the greatest statistical differences were observed for the excretory system, transcription and substance dependence. However, for KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes, the rankings varied in different groups; metabolic pathways, ABC transporters and two-component systems occupied the top categories in the M versus JP group. The previous studies summarized plant polysaccharides alleviating CRC by modulation of immune system and intestinal microorganism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> Our data in the present study indicated this function might result in activation of intestinal microorganism as the up-regulated differential express genes involving JP degradation to produce anti-inflammatory factors pathways (metabolic pathways, ABC transporters and two-component systems) in JP group. These results indicated that JP treatment significantly affected these pathways in this study, which is worthy of future investigation.</p><p>JP bioactivity greatly depends on its transformation in the gut. The different health effects of JP have been shown to be a result of individual variability in intestinal microbial ecology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> We have demonstrated a better understanding of the two-way interactions between JP and intestinal microbiota. This allows us to evaluate and correlate the contribution of microbial metabolites from JP metabolism, to improvements in host health. More metagenomic approaches are required to clarify metabolic pathways altered by JP intervention.</p></div>
