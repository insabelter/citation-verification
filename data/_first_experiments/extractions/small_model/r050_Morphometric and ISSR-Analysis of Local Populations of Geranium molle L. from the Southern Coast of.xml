<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Geranium molle is known as Dovefoot Geranium or Awnless Geranium. Dovefoot Geranium is a low-growing herb with pink flowers and sharply toothed leaves. Dovefoot Geranium is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to many habitats of the world. This species is very similar to G. robertianum but its palmate-like leaves and bilobed petals show differences. This plant is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. We have no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Therefore, due to the importance of these plant species, we performed a combination of morphological and molecular data for this species. For this study, we used 132 randomly collected plants from 18 geographical populations in 4 provinces. Genetic diversity parameters were determined in these populations. STRUCTURE analysis and K-Means clustering identified 14 gene pools in the country and revealed isolation by distance among the studied populations. The Mantel test showed correlation between genetic and geographical distance. AMOVA revealed a significant genetic difference among populations and showed that 40% of total genetic variation was due to within-population diversity. The consensus tree of both molecular and morphological data identified divergent populations. These data may be used in future breeding and conservation of this important medicinal plant in the country.</p></div>

Population genetics data can help us to choose effective management strategies for conservation of endangered and/or invasive species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The genus Geranium L. comprises more than 400 species in different temperate habitats of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The generic delimitation and a complete description of the genus are provided by Aedo <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

Geranium molle L. belongs to section Batrachioidea of the subgenus Robertium <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, which is distributed in Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. It is mainly found in northern parts of Iran at the southern coast of Caspian Sea. This species is a common weed of gardens, roadsides, pastures, disturbed sites and waste areas. It shows a great invasion in natural habitats, although generally seen as a potential environmental weed. G. molle is very similar to G. robertianum L., both species are in the subgenus Robertium that is characterized by the "carpel-projection" type of fruit discharge. G. molle differs from G. robertianum in having palmate leaves, bilobed petals, and smaller flowers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Dovefoot Geranium is an annual or perennial herb with a low rate of growth. It has multiple stems and basal leaves. Branched stems grow erect to 9-60 cm tall. The stems are reddish towards the base and densely covered with white hairs. The hairy leaf stalks are longer in basal leaves and shorter in the cauline leaves. The leaves are dull green with ciliate edges. Self-fertilized flowers occur from April to September. It can tolerate a wide range of soil types but requires dry to very dry and well drained soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. There are no edible uses for G. molle. But it is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. It has minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and fibre.</p><p>Molecular markers are useful in identifying the maximally diverse parental genotypes through an evaluation of genetic diversity which is useful in cultivar identification and breeding. Among the various molecular markers, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) are simple and quick techniques and have become popular as their application does not need any prior information about the target sequences in the genome, high-efficiency and sharp sensibility, and these techniques have now been widely used for line identification and genetic diversity. These markers have been used in DNA fingerprinting, conservation biology, identification and determination of species relationships in many plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. G. molle grows in different regions of Iran and comprises many local geographical populations. Therefore, the present study was performed for the first time in the country to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of these local populations. The results of present study may have positive effect on conservation strategy and future breeding of this medicinally important plant. We used ISSR molecular markers in the present study as these markers were shown to be informative for genetic diversity and population structure studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphometry</head><p>In present study 132 plant samples were collected from 18 geographical populations. ANOVA test revealed significant difference in quantitative morphological characters among the studied populations (P &lt; 0.05). Clustering and PCoA plot of G. molle populations based on morphological characters produced similar results therefore only UPGMA is presented and discussed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). In general, two major clusters were formed in UPGMA tree 1-13, 16 populations showed morphological similarity and were placed in the first major cluster. The population no. 15 has subdivision on two subclusters, but one of subclusters showed higher degree of morphological similarity with population no. 14 and formed the second major cluster.</p><p>The result showed morphological difference/ divergence among most of the studied populations. This morphological difference was due to quantitative characters only. For example, population no. 16 has the shortest stem and basal-leaf length (1 cm), the shortest basal-leaf width (1.5 cm), the narrowest petal and calyx length (3.5 mm), among the studied populations. Similarly, population no. 3 had the longest stem-leaf length (2 cm), the broadest basal-leaf width (4 cm) and the longest petal length (6.3 mm), besides character as (petiole length of Basal leaves), separate population no. 7 form the other, while pedicel length separate population no. 6 from the other populations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population Genetic Differentiation</head><p>AMOVA (PhiPT = 0.59, P = 0.010) revealed significant difference among the studied populations. It also revealed that, 40% of total genetic variability was due to within population diversity and 60% was due to among population genetic differentiation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Pairwise AMOVA produced significant difference among the studied populations. Moreover, we got high values for Hedrick standardized fixation index after 999 permutation (G'st = 0.373, P = 0.001) and Jost, differentiation index (D-est = 0.435, P = 0.001). These results indicate that the geographical populations of G. molle are genetically differentiated from each other.</p><p>Non-metric MDS plots of ISSR data (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) showed both intra-and inter-population genetic diversity. The plots showed higher within population genetic diversity in the population no. 15 (East Azerbaijan kaleybar), supporting genetic diversity parameters obtained (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Genetic divergence and separation of populations 1-3, 5, 11, 8 as well as 15 and 16 from the other populations is evident in MDS plot of ISSR data after 900 permutations (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The other populations as population nos. 12 and 13, show some genetic similarity and overlapping as well as populations nos. 17 and 18, the overlapping occurs to a lesser extent for populations nos. 9 and 10, populations nos. 6 and 14, pop. nos. 4 and 7.</p><p>Mantel test after 5000 permutations produced significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance in these populations (r = 0.41, P = 0.0002). Therefore, the populations that are geographically more distant have less amount of gene flow, and we have isolation by distance (IBD) in G. molle.</p></div>

The second major cluster contained two sub-clusters, plants of populations nos. 9 and 10 comprised the first subcluster both from Mazandaran, second sub-cluster was formed by populations nos. 1, 2 and 5, 6. The other populations comprised the third major cluster and were distributed into two subclusters. Populations nos. 7, 8 and 4 which comprised the first sub-cluster, while populations nos. 11-13 and 17, 18, 3 comprised the second sub-cluster.</p><p>Among-population differentiation in phenotypic traits and allelic variation is expected to occur as a consequence of isolation, drift, founder effects and local selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>We have almost complete separation of the studied population in the network, supporting AMOVA result. The populations nos. 1-6 and 11, 16 are distinct and stand separate from the other populations with great distance. The populations nos. 7 and 8, as well as populations 12, 13 and 17, 18 show closer genetic similarity and are placed close to each other. Also, the other populations as population nos. 9, 10 and 14, 15 show some genetic similarity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Populations Genetic Structure</head><p>The Evanno test produced delta k = 14 as the best number of genetic groups. A STRUCTURE plot based on k = 14 in presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. The STRUC-TURE plot has revealed the allele combination difference among the studied populations and the occurrence of genetic admixture among them.</p><p>This genetic grouping is in agreement with Neighbor Net diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>), presented before. Therefore, 14 gene pools are identified for Geranium molle in the country. Although the studied populations contained some specific alleles for example populations nos. 1-6 and 11, 16 (differently colored segments in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>), they shared some similar alleles too. For example, it  The plants of population no. 9 had some similar alleles for population no. 10: population no. 14 had some similar alleles for population 15. Moreover, mean Nm value of 0.23 was obtained for the studied populations that showed low value of gene flow, supporting STRUCTURE plot result. However, reticulogram obtained based on the least square method (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>), revealed some amount of shared alleles among populations nos. <ref type="bibr">16 and 17, 18</ref> and between nos. 9, 10 and 11 also between no. 15 and 7, 8 and between nos. 1 and 5, 6. This result is in agreement with grouping we obtained with Neighbor-Net, as these populations were placed close to each other. As evidenced by STRUCTURE plot based on admixture model, these shared alleles comprise very limited part of the genomes in these populations and all these results are in agreement in showing high degree of genetic stratification within G. molle populations. 0.1 0 A consensus tree was obtained for both ISSR and morphological trees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>), to reveal the populations that are diverged based on both morphological and molecular features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The distribution of plant species is determined by various factors, such as physiological limitations, ecological niche, and geological history <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Plant populations in the center of their distribution generally sustain stable conditions in a desirable environment for the species, while location at the margin of their distribution are exposed to less suitable location for establishment and to greater competition with other species than at their distribution center <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>Population genetic study provides valuable information about genetic structure of plants, the stratification versus gene flow among the species populations, genetic divergence of the populations, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These information have different applications, and from pure understanding of biology of the species to conservation of endangered species, choosing of proper parents for hybridization and breeding and phylogeography and mechanism of invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Geranium molle mainly found in northern parts of Iran at the southern coast of Caspian Sea. The present study revealed interesting data about its genetic vari-ability, genetic stratification and morphological divergence in north part of Iran.</p><p>The studied populations have a low level of genetic diversity (He = 0.026-0.190). The Genetic diversity is of fundamental importance in the continuity of a species as it is used to bring about the necessary adaptation to the cope with changes in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Degree of genetic variability within a species is highly correlated with its reproductive mode, the higher degree of open pollination/cross breeding brings about higher level of genetic variability in the studied taxon <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. G. molle is mainly self-pollinating species <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, therefore, low level of genetic variability within populations in this species might be related to its selfing nature. The mean Nm = 0.23 was obtained for investigated ISSR loci, which indicates low amount of gene flow among the populations and supports genetic stratification as indicated by Neighbor-Net diagram and STRUCTURE analyses.</p><p>Similarly, the lower level of genetic variability occurred in Geranium species with limited geographical distribution and probably more selfing capabilities.

However, limited gene flow was not solely due to geographical distance among the species, but some of the species, which grew in adjacent areas with overlapping zones, did not form any hybrids or intermediate forms as evidenced by morphological and ISSR clusters obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Another well-known feature of self-pollinating species is high among-population genetic and morphological divergence. This happens due to limited amount of gene flow or its complete absence among geographical population in a single species <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The present study also revealed significant morphological and genetic difference among G. molle populations, quite in agreement with the mentioned assumption. This is particularly supported by STRUCTURE plot that identified 14 separate genetic groups within this populations and by consensus tree of both morphological and genetic data. Different mechanisms like isolation, drift, founder effects and local selection may act to bring about among population differentiation and therefore, populations differ in phenotypic traits and allelic composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>The present population divergence may be under influence of isolation-by distance across the distribution range of the studied G. molle populations. The dispersal of these populations might be constrained by distance and gene flow is most likely to occur between neighboring populations. As a result, more closely situated populations tend to be more genetically similar to one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The populations, divergence may be accompanied by local adaptation. When we use multilocus molecular markers (such as SSR, AFLP, RAPD, ISSR, etc.) for population genetic studies we understand that these are neutral molecular markers (they are not directly acting as adaptive genes), but they may be linked to a gene or a genetic region with adaptive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Therefore, combination of genetic divergence, limited gene flow and local adaptation have played role in diversification of G. molle population in the country. An ecotype is a distinct set of genotypes (or populations) within a species, resulting from adaptation to local environmental conditions, but which are capable of inter breeding with other ecotypes of the same species <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Ecotypes are populations adapted to local conditions, at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Creation of a ecotype is very important because this type of variation has adaptive value for each species and increases biodiversity in the ecosystems. Matching ecotypes to local conditions increases restoration success. A practical value of recognizing ecotypic variation in grasses is in identifying the most suitable ecotypes for conservation, restoration, renovation, landscaping, and bioremediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the above definition, some ecotypes were distinguished within the studied populations. For example some of these populations had distinct morphological traits and also genetic content, such as populations nos. 3, 5-7 and 12, 16 were genetically differentiated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). A consensus tree was obtained for both ISSR and morphological trees divergence of almost the most populations at molecular level as well as morphological characteristics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). Detailed comparison of the characteristics in these populations revealed noticeable morphometric differences described above for populations nos. 16, 3, 7, 5. But we should state that, the studied populations differed in quantitative morphological characters and we do not know how much of the morphological difference  1 0 among the studied populations is genetically controlled; they may be under influence of environmental conditions. Therefore we do not attempt to suggest new taxonomic forms bellow the species level for this taxon and consider them as different ecotypes only.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
