One way to achieve a sustainable future in urban areas and remote communities is to use the independent renewable energy systems. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common sources of energy generation that has attracted of the world. The present study provides the comprehensive examine the performance of two parabolic dish collector and flat-plate collector from energy, exergy, Enviroeconomic and Exergoenviroeconomic view of points. To examine the performance of solar systems, the climatic conditions of two different cities in Asia (Beijing and Tehran) have been used. In addition, the performance of the systems is investigated under different parameters and using different working fluids and MWCNT nanoparticle. It was found that the both solar systems have better overall performance in Tehran than in Beijing. Moreover, in the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months. In addition, the lowest and highest Levelized Cost of Energy are belong to dish collector (in Tehran with water) and flat plate collector (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively. For Tehran, LCOE of dish collector increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water.</p></div>

The use of conventional fuels has two major problems: depletion of reserves and air pollution. The future of energy demands for human society is related to renewable energy. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common renewable sources of electricity and heat generation that has attracted of the world. However, the operation of solar energy systems is associated with some challenges and obstacles. The aim of this paper is to investigate and comparison two stationary and concentrating solar collectors from energy and exergy points of view. In the present work, the performance of two FPC and PDC solar collectors in Tehran and Beijing are investigated. The influence of using various fluids and nanofluids as a HTF on performance solar thermal systems is examined. The use of nanofluids as a new medium for heat transfer can have a significant effect on increasing the rate of heat transfer, consequently leading to improved solar collectors performance. A review of the literature revealed that such a comprehensive study on stationary and concentrating solar collectors that examine climate data for two different cities in Asia has not been studied. In addition, parameters such as LCOE, Enviroeconomic (E 1 ) and Exergoenviroeconomic (E 2 ), entropy generation rate and Sustainability index for solar systems are investigated and compared. Moreover, the results provided in the present paper do not correspond to any of the findings of previous similar studies. Therefore, the main objectives of this work are to comprehensively study the performance of two types of solar collectors for thermal energy generation and compare them in Tehran and Beijing, decreasing the consumption of fossil fuel, consequently decreases the pollutants emissions by use of clean energy and ability to apply the obtained results for use in experimental works. Furthermore, the obstacles and challenges of solar energy development in Iran and China are discussed. Overall, the obtained results of research and challenges raised are very encouraging and useful for governments and energy systems engineers and designers.</p><p>The rest sections of this paper are as follows: Section 2 describes the numerical modeling of the two solar collectors, LCOE, Enviroeconomic and exergoenviroeconomic parameters and heat transfer fluids specifications. Section 3 provided the climatic data. Section 4 presents the simulation results and carries out the analysis of performance assessment parameters; Section 5 summarizes the conclusion of this paper.</p></div>

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) balances materials and energy throughout the life of a solar collector <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Yu et al., 2020)</ref>. In this index, research objectives and boundaries should be considered for accurate evaluation of the system. LCA is presented in four separate stages (definition of scope and goal, inventory analysis, impact evaluation and interpretation), the various stages often being interrelated in that the results of one stage can determine how the other stages are completed. By calculating the LCA, its impact on the environment can be determined. By determining the amount of energy output and CO 2 produced by the solar system in operating time, its environmental effects can be assessed. In this paper, for the environmental analysis of solar thermal systems, the LCA and carbon pricing methods (enviroeconomic aspect, to reduce or cut the CO 2 emission) are used. So, the enviroeconomic assessment is provided as a tool to evaluate the solar collectors' carbon pricing. In addition, by considering the three parameters of exergy rate, value of CO 2 emission (based on LCA), and hours of working, an exergoenvironmental assessment (information about exergy performance based on carbon dioxide value) can be provided. The difference between exergoenvironmental analysis and environmental analysis is in their data. In environmental analysis, energy results are used and in exergoenvironmental analysis, exergy results are used. Finally, to assess the amount of CO 2 emission, another analysis called an exergoenviroeconomic analysis can be used. The determination of this index, in addition to the first law, is important in terms of the first and second thermodynamics laws.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Climatic data</head><p>Due to the different latitudes, climatic conditions and altitude, the amount of solar energy received in any region is different. Two important climatic parameters in the performance of solar systems are the solar irradiance and ambient temperature. In this work, to examine the performance of the FPC and PDC systems the climatic conditions of Beijing (in China) and Tehran (in According to Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the average solar irradiance in Beijing and Tehran is 0.28 and 0.46kW/m 2 , respectively. Moreover, average ambient temperature in Beijing and Tehran are 12.86, 18.39 • C, respectively (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>

The highest deviation in energy efficiency and outlet temperature of solar collector is 1.48% and 0.9%, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Energy performance</head><p>Determining the useful output power of a solar collector is one of the essential parameters in evaluating its performance. In general, more intensity of solar radiation leads to more output of the solar system. In the previous section, it was mentioned that  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Meteotest, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 3.</head><p>Monthly average ambient temperature in selected regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Meteotest, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>the monthly average solar irradiance in Tehran is 66.93% higher than that in Beijing. Therefore, it is expected that the useful output power of solar collectors in Tehran will be higher than that in Beijing. The monthly average useful power output of PDC and FPC in Beijing and Tehran is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The average useful output power of the PDC in Beijing is 94.7% lower than that in Tehran. In addition, in both regions, the highest useful power output of the PDC is related to the Jun. However, the useful output power of the collector in Jun for Tehran is 95.2% higher than that in Beijing. Also, the lowest useful output power of the PDC system is obtained in Tehran and Beijing at Jan and Dec, respectively. The lowest PDC useful output power in Tehran is 95.84% more than that in Beijing. In addition to the solar insolation, according to the radiation loss relationship in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, it is clear that with increasing ambient temperature, the amount of radiation loss of PDC decreases. Since the average ambient temperature in Tehran is 5.53 degree higher than that in Beijing, the radiation loss of the PDC system in Beijing are higher than that in Tehran, which leads to a decrease in the collector output power in Beijing. The same trend is shown for FPC system. With the difference that the average useful output power of the FPC in Tehran is 48.14% higher than that in Beijing. Similarly, the highest and lowest useful output power of the FPC in Tehran (Beijing) is related to Jun (Jun) and Jan (Dec), respectively. It was also found that, due to the low average ambient temperature in Beijing compared to Tehran, the FPC has more losses in Beijing than Tehran, which leads to lower useful output power of FPC in Beijing than in Tehran. In addition, it was apparent that assuming the similar conditions; PDC produces 146.1% and 87.2% high useful power than the FPC in Tehran and Beijing, respectively. The main reason for this more power produced by PDC is due to the inherent nature of concentrating solar collectors. In concentrating solar collectors, due to the use of the solar tracking system, the sunlight receives more intense radiation, which leads to the production of more energy. The next parameter in evaluating the energy performance of the solar collector is energy efficiency. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the monthly average energy efficiency of PDC and FPC in selected regions. According to Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), by increasing the Q of the solar collector, its energy efficiency increases. The average PDC energy efficiency in Beijing is 17.21% lower than that in Tehran. In addition, in both regions, the highest energy efficiency of the PDC is related to the Jun. However, the collector energy efficiency in Jun for Beijing is 13.31% lower than that in Tehran. Also, the lowest energy efficiency of the PDC system is obtained in Tehran and Beijing at Jan and Dec, respectively. The lowest PDC energy efficiency in Tehran is 25.48% more than that in Beijing. Similar to PDC, the FPC system in Tehran has a higher energy efficiency compared to Beijing. The average FPC energy efficiency in Beijing is 30.06% lower than that in Tehran. In addition, the highest energy efficiency obtained from the FPC in Tehran is 20.6% higher than that in Beijing. However, the FPC system in Beijing has very low energy efficiency in the colder months of the year (i.e., Jan and Dec). For instance, the energy efficiency of FPC (in Jan) in Beijing is about 3-fold lower than that in Tehran. This is because the solar radiation and ambient temperature in Tehran (at the Jan) is about 54.5% and 7.5 degree, respectively, higher than that in Beijing. Furthermore, it was found that assuming the similar conditions; the average energy efficiency of PDC is 45.45% and 61.4% higher than that of the FPC in Tehran and Beijing, respectively. Therefore, it can be said that, in both regions, the PDC has better energy performance compared to the FPC. other words, to provide the thermal energy, a smaller area of the PDC is required compared to the FPC. However, the cost of the PDC is higher than the FPC that should be considered.</p><p>Another main factor in evaluating the solar collectors operation is the temperature of its outlet heat transfer fluid. Note that in this paper, the temperature of the inlet fluid in the PDC and FPC is 120 and 40 • C, respectively. Therefore, in order to rationally investigate the difference between the outlet and inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid was calculated. The monthly average increased temperature (or temperature difference; TD) of the outlet fluid in PDC and FPC in selected regions is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Obviously, the PDC generates more thermal energy with higher temperatures. The average temperature difference of the PDC in Tehran is 8.01 degree higher than that in Beijing. Furthermore, in both regions, the highest increased temperature of the PDC is related to the Jun. However, the TD of the collector in Jun for Tehran is 10.53 degree higher than that in Beijing. Also, the lowest temperature difference of the PDC system is obtained in Tehran and Beijing at Jan and Dec, respectively. The lowest temperature difference of PDC in Tehran is 4.74 degree more than that in Beijing. Similar to PDC, the FPC system in Tehran has a higher increased temperature compared to in Beijing. The average TD of the FPC in Beijing is 2.18 degree lower than that in Tehran. In addition, the highest temperature difference obtained from the FPC in Tehran is 3.31 degree higher than that in Beijing. However, the FPC system in Beijing has very low TD in the colder months of the year (i.e., Jan and Dec). For instance, the increased temperature of FPC (in Jan) in Beijing is about 3.2-fold lower than that in Tehran. This is because the solar radiation and ambient temperature in Beijing (at the Jan) is lower than that in Tehran. Furthermore, it was found that assuming the average TD of PDC is 9.77 and 3.94 degree higher than that of the FPC in Tehran and Beijing, respectively. Therefore, in both cities, the PDC generates warmer thermal energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Exergy performance</head><p>Irreversibility in practical processes produces entropy and exergy destruction. To investigate the exergy operation of the FPC and PDC systems, the exergy destruction (ED) and exergy efficiency (EF) should be calculated. By investigation the exergy performance, a better view can be obtained for the design of the system. The unavoidable ED is a main part of solar system ED. Based on relationships described in Section 2, the exergy operation of FPC and PDC depends on net exergy of heat transfer fluid, exergy losses, exergy destruction and input exergy of solar collector. However, the net exergy of heat transfer fluid depends on specific heat, flow rate and inlet and outlet temperatures of fluid as well as ambient temperature. In addition, the input exergy of solar collector depends on input energy and T a and T s . Since the input energy of the solar system depends on the solar irradiance, so the exergy performance of the system also depends on the solar radiation (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>)). Therefore, the use of FPC and PDC collectors in each region with different climatic conditions will have different exergy operation. The monthly average EF and ED of PDC and FPC systems in Tehran and Beijing are illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, respectively. The PDC thermal energy production in Tehran and Beijing has a superior exergy performance than FPC, where the average exergy efficiency of the PDC is more than 5-fold higher than that FPC in Tehran and Beijing. Furthermore, the average EF of the PDC in Beijing is 14.87% lower than that in Tehran. However, this value is 11.47% for the FPC. In both regions, the highest EF of the PDC is related to the Mar. However, the EF of the PDC in Mar for Tehran is 7.41% higher than that in Beijing. Moreover, the lowest EF of the PDC is obtained in Tehran and Beijing at Aug and Jul, respectively. The lowest PDC exergy efficiency in Beijing is 17.36% lower than that in Tehran. Therefore, it can be said that, in the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months. It was found that the highest EF of the FPC in Beijing is 20.35% higher than that in Tehran. However, the lowest EF of FPC in Tehran is about 4fold higher than in Beijing. So, it lead to the average EF of FPC in Beijing is lower than in Tehran. For instance, the EF of FPC (in Jan) in Beijing is about 2.5-fold lower than that in Tehran.</p><p>Meanwhile, solar collectors have more exergy destruction in Tehran than in Beijing. It was found that, the average ED of the PDC in Beijing is 61.95% lower than that in Tehran. This value is significantly less for the FPC and is equal to 17.18%. In both cities, the highest exergy destruction of PDC and FPC is related to Jul and Jun, respectively, which in Tehran is 35.75% and 19.76% more than in Beijing. In addition, the lowest ED of FPC in Beijing is 9.92% and 19.76% lower than in Tehran. However, the lowest exergy destruction of PDC (in Jan) in Tehran is significantly higher (more than 20-fold) compared to in Beijing (in Dec). Meanwhile, the exergy efficiency of PDC in Jan and Dec in Tehran is 19% and 20.3% higher than in Beijing, respectively. Therefore, it can   be said that in throughout the year, the PDC in Tehran has significant exergy performance than in Beijing. In general, more ED means the system has low exergy losses and by rising the input exergy of solar collector (increasing solar radiation), the ED of the system increased. Therefore, the exergy performance of both solar collectors in Tehran is better than in Beijing (due to the high average solar radiation in Tehran compared to Beijing). In addition, it was found that in similar design conditions the PDC has superior exergy and energy performances than the FPC.</p><p>As mentioned, two main indexes in the exergy investigation of the solar collectors are the SI and the S g . Sustainability index and the entropy generation rate are related to EF and ED, respectively. Using S g parameter, the effect of irreversibility in the solar system can be measured. The value of this parameter depends on the nature of the process. In general, S g can be achieved by subtracting the entropy change from entropy transfer. According to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>), the value of S g is directly related to ED and increases with decreasing ambient temperature. Since both the PDC and FPC had higher exergy destruction in Tehran than in Beijing, solar systems generate more entropy in Tehran. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> illustrated the monthly average value of S g for PDC and FPC in selected regions. The average S g for the PDC in Beijing is 60.94% lower than that in Tehran. In addition, in both regions, the highest value of S g of the PDC is related to the Jul. However, the value of S g of the collector in Jul for Beijing is 33.7% lower than that in Tehran. Also, the lowest value of S g of the PDC system is obtained in Beijing and Tehran at Dec and Jan, respectively. However, the lowest PDC entropy generation rate in Tehran (2.6 W/K) is significantly higher compared to in Beijing (0.12 W/K). The same trend is found for FPC system. The average value of S g of the FPC in Beijing is 14.79% lower than that in Tehran. But in the FPC system the highest value of S g of the FPC in Beijing and Tehran is related to Jun. It was also found that, the average ED of PDC in Tehran is 61.95% higher than in Beijing. However, the average value of S g of PDC in Beijing is 60.94% lower than in Tehran. The reason is that the average ambient temperature in Tehran is higher than in Beijing. In addition, the PDC generates 60.7% and 14.6% more entropy in Tehran and Beijing, respectively, compared to the FPC. Therefore, it is concluded that the PDC system in Tehran have more potential to generate entropy.</p><p>On the other hand, according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>), the system that has better exergy performance has a higher sustainability index. A high sustainability index means a reduction in the environmental impact of the energy system. Since both the PDC and FPC had higher exergy efficiency in Tehran than in Beijing, solar systems will have higher SI in Tehran. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> demonstrated the monthly average SI rate of PDC and FPC in Tehran and Beijing. The average SI rate of PDC in Tehran and Beijing is 15.06% and 12.71% higher than the value in the FPC system, respectively. This means that the PDC has more positive effects on the environment than the FPC system; because under the same conditions, the PDC converts more solar energy into thermal energy (due to its concentrating nature).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Different heat transfer fluids</head><p>In this subsection, the FPC and PDC performances with various HTFs is investigated. These heat transfer fluids include water, Dowtherm Q, and water/MWCNT and Dowtherm Q/MWCNT nanofluids. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> shows the SEM image and XRD graph of MWCNT particles. The diameter of MWCNT is between 20 nm and 50 nm. It has been shown that the performance of a solar collector can be significantly improved by adding amounts of nanoparticles to the working fluid. The benefit of nanofluids as a working fluid raises the thermal conductivity, which leads to more thermal energy production. In other words, by increasing the thermal conductivity, more thermal energy is produced at higher temperatures. That is, the difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the solar collector increases. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> shows the thermal conductivity of different HTFs versus particle volume fraction. Obviously, by adding nanoparticle to the working fluids, the value of k of the heat transfer fluid increases. For instance, at φ = 5%, the value of k of water/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.36% higher than that of water. In such a context, the thermal conductivity of the Dowtherm Q/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.42% higher than that of Dowtherm Q. Water heat capacity is higher than Dowtherm Q, so PDC and FPC systems are expected to have better energy and exergy performance when using water. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> presents the temperature difference (in degree) of PDC and FPC with different heat transfer fluids in Tehran and Beijing. Using Dowtherm Q instead of water as the working fluid of solar collectors decreases their outlet temperature. The average temperature difference of the PDC and FPC in Tehran when using Dowtherm Q are decreased by 7.84 and 3.19 degrees, respectively. These values in Beijing are 4.02 and 2.15 degrees for PDC and FPC, respectively. However, using nanofluids instead of base fluids as the working fluid of solar collectors increases their outlet temperature. The average temperature difference of the PDC and FPC in Tehran when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water are increased by 1.96 and 0.79 degrees, respectively. These values in Beijing are 1.01 and 0.54 degrees for PDC and FPC, respectively. Moreover, the mean temperature difference of the PDC and FPC in Tehran when using Dowtherm Q /MWCNT nanofluid instead of Dowtherm Q are increased by 1.03 and 0.42 degrees, respectively. These values in Beijing are 0.53 and 0.29 degrees for PDC and FPC, respectively. Therefore, the use of nanofluids as a new medium for heat transfer can have a significant effect on increasing the rate of heat transfer, consequently leading to improved solar collector performance.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Levelized cost of energy</head><p>Apart from the environmental benefits of using solar energy, which has significant benefits for human society, determining the LCOE of solar collectors can be beneficial to governments and investors. In addition, it is proven that the LCOE is the most commonly used indicator to assess the feasibility of solar collectors. The results of the LCOE calculation for FPC and PDC systems with various HTFs and nanofluids in Beijing and Tehran are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>. Note that the mean values of Q in Beijing and Tehran is used to calculate the LCOE. Furthermore, the interest rate, operation years and working hours of solar collectors are considered to 8%, 20 years and 6 h per day, respectively. According to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), the LCOE decreases as the solar system useful output power increases and the purchase cost of collector decreases. The cost of flat plate collector less than that dish collector. However, the useful output power of the PDC is higher than that FPC, which leads to a lower LCOE of the PDC compared to that FPC. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref> revealed that in both cities the PDC is less LCOE than that FPC (for all heat transfer fluids and nanofluids). In addition, it was found that the lowest and highest LCOE are related to PDC (in Tehran with water) and FPC (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively.</p><p>Although the use of nanofluids improves the performance of solar collectors, the high price of nanoparticle leads to an increase in LCOE of solar collector when using nanofluids. For instance, for Tehran, LCOE of PDC increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water.</p></div>

In addition, the exergoenviroeconomic (E 2 ) analysis assesses the amount of CO 2 emission. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> provided the Enviroeconomic, and exergoenviroeconomic parameters of solar collectors in Tehran and Beijing. It was found that the value of both parameters is higher in Tehran than in Beijing. Because Tehran has a higher average solar intensity compared to Beijing. According to Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>), both Enviroeconomic and exergoenviroeconomic parameters are directly related to the amount of solar radiation (input solar energy). In addition, the value of these parameters is the same for both solar collectors. The average values of E 1 and E 2 in Tehran are 69.23% and 66.67% higher than in Beijing, respectively. In addition, the lowest values of E 1 and E 2 in Tehran are 0.0014 and 0.0013 $ per day, respectively, which is related to Jan. The lowest values of E 1 and E 2 in Beijing are 0.0009 and 0.0007 $ per day, respectively, which is related to Dec. Therefore, in general it can be concluded that the amount of d CO 2 released in Tehran is more than in Beijing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Challenges of solar energy development</head><p>Solar energy has been considered by countries from two points of view. First, the sun is a free energy source, and if the infrastructure of this technology is provided, the use of solar electricity/heat will be very economical and market fluctuations or political and international factors will not interfere in its supply. Second, electricity or heat generated by sunlight is considered one of the cleanest types of energy, and gas power plants are not comparable to solar energy plants from this point of view. A country that can expand its solar infrastructure and grid faster will compete in electricity generation and economic development; because investing in solar energy means investing in energy independence. In 2016, China's National Energy Agency announced that China has become the world's largest solar energy producer. China is not only the most populous country in the world, but is now also the largest solar energy producer in the world. The same organization recently announced that in the first three months of 2020, 3.95 GW was added to the capacity of the country's solar power plants, of which about 56% are large-scale PV systems and the rest are DG and small-scale plants. Therefore, the total installed capacity of solar power plants in China has reached 208 GW by the end of March 2020. However, although this capacity is amazing, it is insignificant compared to the high population of China. The main challenges of further development of solar energy technology in China include some issues. The initial draft of China's 2020 solar policy has left the Chinese people skeptical about the possible budget for the solar power plant. Another challenge is the possibility of falling coal prices in China, which is a new threat to the development of solar power plants. In addition, China's air pollution is a major obstacle to solar power generation. Air pollution in China prevents sunlight from reaching the solar panel, which has significantly reduced energy production. Researchers from 2003 to 2014 in northern and eastern China, the most polluted parts of the country, found that energy production was reduced by up to 1.5kWh/m 2 per day due to pollution. In the East, production has fallen by up to 35%, while it has been one of the top 10 producers of solar energy in recent years. Research also shows that in western China; where industrialization and urbanization are not widespread and pollution is lower than in other regions, solar energy production has dropped by up to 10%. The worst time is in the winter, when in addition to pollution, the clouds also block sunlight, during which time solar energy production is reduced by about 20%.</p><p>Regarding Iran's capacity to develop solar energy, it should be noted that if a country like China can focus on solar energy, Iran has the potential to invest even more in the solar industry; because the number of sunny days in Iran is much more than in China. In most regions of Iran, there are about 300 sunny days a year, which reduces the need for quantitative expansion of solar power plants. According to the Iranian Ministry of Energy, the total capacity of Iran's solar energy has reached about 365 MW by the end of June 2020. Meanwhile, about 0.4% of the Iran's area has a power generation capacity of 170 W/m 2 and 17.3% of the Iran's area (equivalent to 28 million hectares), has a power generation capacity of 260 W/m 2 . However, despite this high potential, no proper action has been taken to exploit solar energy in Iran. There are barriers and challenges in the development of solar energy systems in Iran electricity markets. One of the main challenges in Iran is the lack of micro-policies and regulatory programs over the development of such systems. Another important obstacle is the existence of oil and gas resources and the perception of the abundance of these resources in Iran. However, experts and officials believe that relying on fossil fuels, especially oil, could cause irreparable damage at the national level in the near future, especially for future generations. Therefore, it can be said that in Iran, considering the availability of fossil resources and the delivery of cheap fossil fuels to power plants and the transportation system, supporting the production of clean energy is still not one of the country's priorities in terms of energy supply. On the other hand, there are challenges in the purchase price of electricity generated by the Ministry of Energy, obtaining the necessary licenses from relevant institutions and creating the necessary incentives in the private sector for production. Unfortunately, one of the main problems in this field is the existence of vertical organizational structures with multiple layers in the country's organizations, lack of transparency and segregation of duties, and the existence of multitasking in many executive departments, which has delayed the development of solar energy systems. An example of overlap and parallelism in the structure of Iran's solar energy is the similar activities of the New Energy Organization of Iran and the Renewable Energy Technology Development Center. The priorities of the solar energy working group of these organizations are localization and gaining the capability of domestically built solar systems and sustainable development and improving security. However, one of the main problems currently facing the development of solar farms in Iran is the issue of finance and banking issues. That is, to work in the field of solar energy, it should be possible to borrow from banks. Since it is very difficult and complicated to get a loan in Iran to work in the field of energy, and on the other hand, the fees of banks in this field are very high and unusual, so the possibility of investment is very low. Foreign investors, who can borrow or lend from foreign banks, are also concerned about international problems due to recent international constraints, which have also slowed the development of such systems. Development of solar energy application in Iran, in addition to international obstacles, faces other national, local and regional problems. Some of the most important obstacles to the development of solar energy projects in Iran include the lack of policies and programs for development, lack of national and local laws about renewable energy, lack of awareness of planners and national managers with the use of this type of energy resources, weakness in human resource management and barriers to technology transfer have been identified  and investigated. Finally, there are undoubtedly other problems and challenges in this regard. But in general, any policy regarding the development of technologies for the production of renewable energy and their use should consider the market situation (customers and stakeholders of this technology), human resources (sufficient skilled manpower), primary resources, equipment and other infrastructure and technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The use of conventional fuels has two major problems: depletion of reserves and air pollution. The future of energy demands for human society is related to renewable energy. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common renewable sources of electricity and heat generation that has attracted of the world. However, the operation of solar energy systems is associated with some challenges and obstacles. The aim of this paper is to investigate and comparison two stationary and concentrating solar collectors of energy and exergy points of view. In this work, the performance of two FPC and PDC systems in Tehran and Beijing are investigated. The influence of using different fluids as well as nanofluids as a HTF on performance solar thermal systems is examined. In addition, parameters such as LCOE, Enviroeconomic (E 1 ) and Exergoenviroeconomic (E 2 ), SI and S g for solar systems are investigated and compared. The main objectives of this work are to comprehensively study the performance of two types of solar collectors for thermal energy generation and compare them in Tehran and Beijing, decreasing the consumption of fossil fuel and so decrement emissions of pollutants by use of solar energy and ability to apply the obtained results for use in experimental works. Furthermore, the obstacles and challenges of solar energy development in Iran and China are discussed. The main results are as follows:</p><p>• The average useful output power of the PDC and FPC in Tehran is 94.7% and 48.1% higher than that in Beijing, respectively. In addition, in both regions, the highest energy efficiency of the PDC and FPC is related to the Jun;</p><p>• In both regions, the PDC has better energy performance compared to the FPC. In other words, to provide the certain thermal energy, a smaller area of the PDC is required compared to the FPC;</p><p>• In the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months;</p><p>• The PDC system in Tehran has more potential to generate entropy. Furthermore, the average SI rate of PDC in Tehran and Beijing is 15.06% and 12.71% higher than the value in the FPC system, respectively;</p><p>• In both cities the PDC is less LCOE than that FPC (for all HTFs and nanofluids). In addition, the lowest and highest LCOE are belong to PDC (in Tehran with water) and FPC (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively;</p><p>• The use of nanofluids as a new medium for heat transfer can have a significant effect on increasing the rate of heat transfer, consequently leading to improved solar collectors performance;</p><p>• For Tehran, LCOE of PDC increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water;</p><p>• The average values of E 1 and E 2 in Tehran are 69.23% and 66.67% higher than in Beijing, respectively;</p><p>• The total installed capacity of solar power plants in China has reached 208 GW by the end of March 2020. However, although this capacity is amazing, it is insignificant compared to the high population of China;</p><p>• Development of solar energy application in Iran, in addition to international obstacles, faces other national, local and regional problems.</p><p>Future works could examine the performance of solar collectors with other energy systems such as ORC, thermionic and thermoelectric generators, reformer, etc. Also, they can be used in gas turbine-based cycles, fuel cells and biomass. Overall, the obtained results of present paper and challenges raised are very encouraging and useful for governments and energy systems engineers and designers. </p></div>
