Because of this, about 95% of the total propofol in a cell culture dish is free to bind to the cancer cells. Therefore, the free propofol concentration employed in the in vitro cell culture experiments may be 50-500 times that of the clinical concentrations. This would be a lethal dose for humans. Future in vitro experiments should be designed to take protein binding into account. Propofol and the immune systemSurgical trauma is associated with an increase of cytokines and stress hormones in the plasma during the vulnerable peri-operative period [17]. This stress response induces transient suppression of cell-mediated immunity, the primary immune-defense against the invasion of tumor cells and micro-metastasis [33]. Surgery and anesthesia could suppress the immune response by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system [34]. Anesthetics may also directly affect the functions of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T cells, mononuclear cells and dendritic cells [35,36]. NK cells are large, granular cytotoxic lymphocytes that naturally recognize malignant cells, and induce lysis without prior sensitization. Low perioperative levels of NK activity are associated with an increased cancer related morbidity and mortality

Serum from the sevoflurane patient reduced NK cell activating receptor CD16, IL-10, IL-1β, all thus lowering the activity level of NK cells [22,23]. Pro-tumor effectsIn 2002, Garib et al. observed that propofol (3-9 μg/mL) increased migration of MDA-MB-468 cells [24]. They also found that propofol increased intracellular calcium and altered the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of these cells [25]. These effects of propofol were inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. The group tested the hypothesis that propofol was acting via GABA-A receptor chloride channels. Although they found evidence for the gamma subunit of the GABA-A receptor and the effect of propofol was inhibited by the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline, they did not provide evidence for functional channels in the cells.

software for extracting information from scholarly documents Chagas disease Chagas cardiomyopathy TNF-alpha TNFR1 Soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) are natural endogenous inhibitors of TNF and are elevated in inflammatory, autoimmune, and chronic degenerative diseases. In Chagas disease, pleiotropic cytokine TNF is considered key in immunopathology. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the levels of TNF, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in the serum of patients with chronic Chagas disease. TNF and its soluble receptors were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array in the serum of 132 patients, of which 51 had the indeterminate form (IND), 39 the mild cardiac form (CARD 1), 42 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 non-infected individuals (NI). The results indicate that the soluble receptors may regulate TNF in Chagas disease, as their leves were higher in T. cruzi-infected individuals when compared to non-infected individuals. We found a moderate negative correlation between sTNFR1 and TNF in individuals with the IND form, suggesting a relationship with non-progression

Model Classification Explanation:
The reference article supports the statement by explaining how gas-generated overpressures can lead to the fracturing and brecciation of solidifying mush through the development of fluid overpressure in layered intrusions.

Top 3 Chunk Texts:
Excerpt 1:
This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber.Because the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others. Fluids are likely to collect in those rocks which have significant residual porosity. These gas-rich regions may be interconnected via pegmatitic channel ways and fractures. Conversely, rocks with low permeability can act as ''caps'' preventing the escape of fluids. When an escape channel does develop, the fluid escapes violently. The presence of ring fractures suggests the exposed host rock (as with the blocks themselves) was significantly solidified such that the fracturing was not annealed subsequent to pipe formation. This suggests that the fluid-source region was gasrich and silicate-liquid poor. ConclusionsThis study supports earlier contentions that exsolved fluids can create significant overpressures in a solidifying

+ 40% equilibrium liquid was used. Crystallization of these bulk composition was modeled under both dry and water-saturated conditions.In each of the dry runs, isochoric crystallization results in no overpressure above the starting pressure of 2,000 bar. In fact, pressure on the interstitial liquid drops dramatically. This decrease in pressure results from a net crystallization contraction in most crystallizing silicate phases -the solids take up less volume than the liquid (Peterson 1987). By contrast, in those isochoric runs where the crystallizing interstitial liquid is initially water saturated, significant overpressure can develop (Fig. 10). In all three cases, fluids were exsolved continually over the course of crystallization, but overpressure developed only when plagioclase joined the liquidus. This result is due to a relatively higher molar volume of plagioclase compared with that of the interstitial liquid. Thus, for overpressure to develop, the combined crystallization expansion of plagioclase and exsolution of water is required to overcome the crystallization contraction of the other crystallizing phases. Furthermore, the isochoric P-T plot of fluid-saturated magmas demonstrates that an overpressure of about 400 bar can

Excerpt 3:
P-T plot of fluid-saturated magmas demonstrates that an overpressure of about 400 bar can be generated. Plagioclase-saturated liquids develop overpressures immediately, because plagioclase is the first mineral to crystallize, but less overpressure is developed.The requirement that plagioclase joins the liquidus for crystallization overpressure to develop is significant because the breccia pipe is located stratigraphically about 800 to 1,000 m above where plagioclase first appears as an abundant interstitial mineral: it is a modest but obvious increase in the amount of interstitial plagioclase which marks the base of the Lower Critical Zone.Thus, the model results are consistent with our geochemical data: the plagioclase analyzed from pipe blocks has an average An content which does not disagree with an origin near the base of the Lower Critical Zone. Fluidization velocityThe fluidization velocity required to emplace the breccia pipe blocks can be determined by considering the minimum fluid velocity such that the upward drag force counteracts the gravitational force. Thus, to provide an estimate of minimum fluid ascent velocities, fluidization velocities are calculated using empirical equations for the turbulent suspension of non-spherical particles (Riba et al.

This overpressure is in addition to any overpressure from derived compaction in the crystallizing pile. Thus, as seen in Fig. 12, the base of the chamber comprises solid degassed cumulates, with no porosity. This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber.Because the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others.

This can lead to an overpressured situation. For example, Burnham (1979) has shown how differentiation-induced redistribution of water in a magma body can lead to local vapor saturation and to the rapid upward migration of the vapor. Furthermore, the effect of degassing a fluid on magma pressures and on the eruption behavior of a shallow magma chamber has been examined by Tait et al. (1989). Boudreau (1992) broadened the discussion of the physical effects of the exsolution of a volatile phase by examining how degassing may cause overpressure in a solidifying crystal pile. In this study, we apply a crystallization model in order to determine how much overpressure is developed during the crystallization of a volatile, saturated interstitial liquid which crystallizes isochorically (constant volume).We applied the PELE silicate-liquid crystallization model of Boudreau (1999), a PC-platform program based on the MELTS thermodynamic model of Ghiorso and Sack (1995).

(Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency. Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc [1] where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively. The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +.Typical measurements of working electrode potential changes during cycling efficiency experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2.

Naturally, lithium deposition on a lithium substrate is expected to have a higher efficiency, since adherence of Li deposits to lithium substrate is better (23).2. We found that in several solvent systems, cycling efficiency increases as electrolyte concentration increases (24). A m a x i m u m cycling efficiency of lithium electrode in PC-LiC104 was achieved at salt concentration around 1M (2O).In the present work, salt concentration in most of the experiments was around 0.5M, which is somewhat lower than the electrolyte concentrations where m a x i m a in cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes are achieved (20,21,23). The poor lithium cycling efficiency obtained in the three solvent systems (which correlate nicely with the SEM studies indicating massive dendrite formation during Li deposition) should be discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in these solvents ob- tained by the F T I R measurements. It is generally accepted that the electrochemical behavior of lithium electrodes in polar aprotic solvents is surface films-controlled (5,6). Since the resistance of these films to lithium cation transport is the main activation barrier to the electrochemical deposition or

experiments in which Li electrodes were charged (Li deposition); followed by consecutive discharge (Li dissolution) in the various systems. The charge involved in the anodic process was in excess of 10% of the cathodic one. In all cases, the dissolution process leaves m a n y dendrites untouched, and holes are formed. In other experiments, Li electrodes were cycled 5-30 times, followed by prolonged dissolution (twice the charge involved in a single half cycle) as a final process. SEM studies of these electrodes show that the density and average size of the dendrites left increase as a function of n u m b e r of cycles. Table I summarizes the data obtained from the cycling efficiency m e a s u r e m e n t s of Li electrodes in the various systems.All the LiC104 salt solutions studied in this work have quite a poor lithium cycling efficiency. It should be noticed that the values of Table I are s o m e w h a t lower than cycling efficiency values of same solvents that appear in the literature (20)(21)(22). There are two major reasons for these differences:1. The values of Table I were obtained from experiments in which lithium was deposited on nickel or copper substrates. Naturally, lithium

The cell used for cycling efficiency measurements of lithium electrodes: 1 ) nickel or copper disk (working electrode) on which lithium is deposited; 2) lithium disk, counterelectrode attached to a copper rod; 3) lithium wire reference electrode; 4) o space for solution; 5) polyethylene bodies in which the electrodes are embedded; 6) a Teflon cylinder; and 7) glass tubes.An initial amount of lithium (several coulombs per cm 2) was deposited on a nickel or copper electrode. Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency.

Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc [1] where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively. The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +.Typical measurements of working electrode potential changes during cycling efficiency experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2. A periodic galvanostatic operation of the cell described in Fig. 1 was carried out by triggering the PAR (Model 173) potentiostat (set to galvanostatie mode) by a square waveform generator built specially for these experiments.,Spectroscopic measurements.--The FTIR measurements of Li electrodes are described in detail elsewhere (11)(12)(13).

Finally, it is possible that heritable epigenetic alterations are responsible for initiating some MBs. The last explanation, involving covalent changes in chromatin proteins and DNA, is intriguing given the new data on MLL2 in this tumor type. It should thus be informative to characterize the methylation status of histones and DNA in MBs with and without MLL2/MLL3 gene alterations, as well as to determine the expression changes resulting from these gene mutations. These data highlight the important connection between genetic alterations in the cancer genome and epigenetic pathways and provide potentially new avenues for research and disease management in MB patients. † Based on 21 nonhypermutable tumors analyzed in (19). ‡ Based on 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors analyzed in (16,17).§ Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total non-silent mutations. ^Ratio of observed to expected nonsense alterations is dependent on mutation spectra in each tumor type (21). ** Includes synonymous as well as nonsynonymous point mutations identified in the indicated study. † † Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total substitutionsFig.

the pathways most highly enriched for genetic alterations had not previously been implicated in MB. These involved genes responsible for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, particularly the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase MLL2. Eighteen of the 88 (20%) tumors harbored a mutation in a gene within these pathways or in a related gene member: the histone-lysine-N methyltransferases MLL2 (mutated in 12 tumors) and MLL3 (3 tumors); the SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actindependent regulator of chromatin members SMARCA4 (3 tumors) and ARID1A (1 tumor); and the histone lysine demethylase KDM6B (1 tumor). The mutations in these genes could be clearly distinguished from passenger alterations. In MLL2, for example, 8 of the 12 mutations (67%) were predicted to truncate the encoded proteins as a result of nonsense mutations, out-of-frame indels, or splice site mutations. In contrast, only 32 of the 222 mutations (14%) not affecting core genes of the Hedgehog, Wnt, or MLL2related pathways (PTCH1, CTNNB1, MLL2,

small fraction of renal cell cancers contain mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2 and the histone demethylase gene JARID1C (33), and the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 has been found to be mutated in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (34). Most recently, frequent mutations of the chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A have been discovered in ovarian clear cell carcinomas (20,35); of note, one ARID1A mutation was discovered in our MB patients (table S4). A link between histone methylation genes (although not MLL2 or MLL3) and MB has also previously been hypothesized based on the observation that copy number alterations affecting chromosomal regions containing histone methyltransferases or demethylases occur in a subset of MBs (36).The mechanism(s) through which MLL genes contribute to tumorigenesis are not known but some clues can be gleaned from the literature. The MLL family of histone H3K4 trimethylases includes seven genes (MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, MLL5, SET1A and SET1B) (37). MLL-family genes have been

This genetic evidence is consistent with functional studies showing that knock-out of murine MLL3 results in ureteral epithelial cancers (29). These genes are large and have been reported in the COSMIC database to be altered in occasional cancers, but not at a sufficiently high frequency to distinguish them from passenger alterations (and with no evidence of a high fraction of inactivating mutations) (30). Interestingly, inactivating germline mutations of MLL2 have recently been identified as a cause of Kabuki syndrome, a multiple malformation disorder without known cancer predisposition (31).The general role of genes controlling histone methylation has become increasingly recognized as a common feature of human cancers. For example, inactivating mutations of the histone H3K27 demethylase gene UTX have been observed in multiple myelomas, esophageal cancers and renal cell cancers (32). In addition, a small fraction of renal cell cancers contain mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2 and the histone demethylase gene JARID1C (33), and the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 has been found to be mutated in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (34).

Excerpt 3:
The probability that by chance alone 11 of the 15 mutations in the two histone methyltransferase genes would cause truncations is very small (p<0.001, binomial test). All truncating mutations in MLL2 and MLL3 were predicted to result in protein products lacking the key methyltransferase domain (Fig. 2). These data not only provide strong evidence that these pathways are important to MBs, but they also show that MLL2 and MLL3 are, on the basis of genetic criteria, tumor suppressor genes that are inactivated by mutation.Discussion. These data provide a comprehensive view of a solid tumor arising in children. The most impressive difference between this tumor type and those affecting adults is the number of genetic alterations observed. This result could not have been predicted on the basis of prior evidence (27). In fact, at the karyotypic level, the incidence of chromosomal changes in MBs is often described as high as that in adult solid tumors [reviewed in (27)].What does the smaller number of mutations reveal about the tumorigenesis of MBs? Most mutations observed in adult tumors are predicted to be passenger alterations (19).

the potential for energy savings through improved efficiency has received increased attention, particularly as low-grade thermal energy or solar energy could be utilized. Currently, silica gel and zeolites are widely utilized commercially, often formed into corrugated honeycomb rotors.

There are additional issues with the level of dehumidification that these materials are able to achieve.

Earth time periods would have provided a zonal barrier at least at low latitudes (see also Ashkenazy et al. 2013Ashkenazy et al. , 2014)). To analyze the effect of a zonal barrier, an additional simulation was performed in a closed basin. The setup is identical to the simulation with D Q 5 0.1 W m 22 described above, but with no normal flow, no-slip boundary conditions along the eastern and western boundaries of the domain. While a weak meridional overturning circulation develops in this simulation, the meridional temperature gradient, stratification, and rms velocity all remain within 20% of the results obtained without a continental boundary (not shown). This result suggests that the presence of continental boundaries, which may support a large-scale mean circulation, is not likely to change the results qualitatively, as also found by Ashkenazy et al. (2013). However, various factors, such as domain size and geometry or spatially inhomogeneous geothermal heating, could substantially impact the large-scale circulation. The potential role of large-scale circulation in a snowball Earth ocean thus remains an interesting topic for future work. c. The role of freezing and meltingAs discussed in section

The presented theoretical arguments may also be relevant to other planetary bodies with an ice-covered ocean. IntroductionGeological evidence suggests that for multiple time periods during Earth's history the oceans were entirely, or almost entirely, covered by sea glaciers (Kirschvink 1992;Hoffman et al. 1998;Hoffman and Li 2009;Hoffman and Schrag 2002;Pierrehumbert et al. 2011). These periods are commonly referred to as ''snowball Earth'' events. While many studies have simulated the atmospheric and climate dynamics of snowball Earth events (e.g., Wetherald and Manabe 1975;Pierrehumbert 2005;Abbot and Pierrehumbert 2010;Voigt and Marotzke 2010;Voigt et al. 2012;Abbot et al. 2013;Rose 2015), the ocean dynamics have received relatively little attention.A number of studies have presented coupled

After the synthesis and catalyst metal layer removal, the monolithic graphene-graphite structure was transferred to a 285 nm-thick SiO 2 substrate (Fig. 1b) (see Methods and Supplementary Information). Due to differences in reflection at the interface between air-graphene multilayers-SiO 2 depending on the number of graphene layers 22 , the three parts (the consonant, vowel, and background) in Fig. 1b showed different colors and contrasts.Raman spectra from these three different graphene-graphite regions (Fig. 1c) exhibited three characteristic bands (D: centered at ~1350 cm -1 , G: ~1590 cm -1 , 2D: ~2680 cm -1 ) of graphene and graphite.

S5). Current versus backgate characteristics showed much stronger modulation in 2-4 layer graphene, compared to negligible change in the thick graphite (~850 layers) due to stronger screening effect as the number of layers increases 26 . The low sheet resistance and field-effect response of graphite are advantageous for applications in conductive films or electrodes, in contrast to superior transconductance level of the 2-4 layer graphene which is appropriate for active channels of field-effect transistors (FETs).The capability to modulate electronic properties through synthetic control of the graphite thickness provides a route to rationally designing and synthesizing large-scale electronics based entirely on carbon. The metal catalyst, Cu/Ni (700 nm/5 nm), was used to synthesize 2-4 layer graphene channels and the same combination with an additional Co (400 nm) was used to produce graphite electrodes which serve as the source (S) and drain (D) (Fig. 2b). This method enabled the fabrication of all-carbon based transistor arrays which were then transferred onto a 285 nm-thick SiO 2 on Si wafer for measurement of backgate response.

Excerpt 3:
In addition to contact properties of graphite electrode to graphene channel, advantages of the graphite, compared to metals, lie in its superb mechanical flexibility. We observed that even when graphite electrodes were distorted up to strain of ~2 %, I-V characteristics remained the same (Fig. 2f).The synthetic method facilitated the creation of a large-scale field-effect sensor arrays composed of monolithic graphene-graphite, which were transferred onto 285-nm SiO 2 / Si wafer. One block of the array contained nine of 2-4 layer graphene field-effect sensors with graphite single common source and independent drains. The sensor chip had four of these blocks composed of 36 sensor devices total, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The graphite electrode parts were covered with a 2 μm-thick SU8 passivation layer with openings around the 2-4 layer graphene channels. The current change measured while sweeping Ag/AgCl water-gate voltage at different pH solution is presented in Fig. 3b. The charge neutrality point shifted positively with increasing pH, and the pH sensitivity was ~17 mV/pH.

Although there is evidence of a mitochondrial phosphoproteome (Pagliarini and Dixon, 2006), proteins annotated as mitochondrial by GO were underrepresented, as were plasma membrane proteins. As membrane proteins are often of low abundance and we did not specifically enrich the plasma membrane in this analysis, we are less likely to identify phosphorylation events associated with them. Conversely, proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, which are generally of higher abundance, were almost twice as likely to be detected in the phosphoproteome as compared with their proportion in the database, and they accounted for an even higher share of the regulated sites. This illustrates that, at the current state of technology, our phosphopeptide screen is still not comprehensive. We may also miss certain phosphopeptides that are either too small or too large in mass to be readily measurable in our current MS setup. Therefore, absence of a phosphorylation site from our data set does not necessarily mean that it does not exist.

Phosphoproteome DynamicsEGF signaling begins with activation of the EGF receptor and extends through a cascade of downstream kinases to mediate the increased phosphorylation of a large number of substrate proteins. The overall levels of phosphorylated proteins within a specific cellular compartment are also affected by other processes, including dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, protein degradation via ubiquitination, and translocation of the protein to another subcellular location. Our experiment measures the net effect of all these diverse processes that collectively regulate the dynamic phosphoproteome.To search for patterns in the time profiles of the regulated phosphopeptides, we explored several clustering techniques.

Given that we have observed 2,244 phosphoproteins in a single cell line and taking into account the sensitivity and dynamic range limitations of current MS technology (de Godoy et al., 2006), it is clear that a large proportion of cellular proteins are phosphorylated.We compared our data set with all annotated human phospho-sites in the SwissProt database from experimental data or inferred from homologous sequences (3,262 sites in version 48.0) and also included four previous phosphoproteomics data sets in our analysis (Amanchy et al., 2005;Beausoleil et al., 2004;Stover et al., 2004;Thelemann et al., 2005). We found that more than 90% of our sites were novel with respect to SwissProt. From the four previous data sets, we were able to map 1,890 sites onto IPI version 3.13. Of these, 691 (37%) were also found in our data set (Table S5). Given that the previous studies generally used lower-resolution MS and different experimental conditions, this is a relatively high value.

We found that the supernatants from Tr1 cell cultures, containing high levels of IL-10 (in the range of 5580-7533 pg/mL), as well as recombinant IL-10, were able to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + Tcells (Fig. 1F; p <0.001). This suppression was impaired in the presence of the anti-IL-10 antibody, confirming that the suppression was mediated by IL-10 (Fig. 1F).

Moreover, the expression of the immunosuppressor cytokine IL-10 is diminished in MS patients [22,23], in accordance with previous studies describing fewer IL-10-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Interestingly, there is a reduction in the expression of IL-10 but elevated numbers of PBMC expressing IL-10 transcripts before clinical relapse in MS [24], and there is a correlation between IL-10 levels and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients [25]. Engineered Th2/Tr1 cells that produce high levels of IL-10 prevent epitope spreading and ameliorate the disease course in animal models of MS [26]. However, it is unknown whether the functional activity of IL-10 in MS is preserved, and attempts to treat MS patients with IL-10 have not been successful to date.In order to explore the functionality of Tr1 regulatory function in MS, we assessed the ex vivo induction of the Tr1 phenotype and the response of CD4 + cells to the IL-10 produced by these cells in patients with MS.

of water in the immediate vicinity of apolar molecules, biological macromolecules, and hydrophobic surfaces. Experimental measurements that provide a molecular-level view of interfacial water structure and hydrogen bonding at these interfaces have proven to be problematic because of the difficulty in selectively examining interfacial water molecules. Hence, most of our understanding of the molecular structure of water at hydrophobic surfaces comes from theory (1-7). Here we report surfacespecific vibrational spectroscopy experiments on the CCl 4 /H 2 O and hexane/H 2 O interfaces, which provide detailed information on the structure and orientation of water influenced by interaction with a hydrophobic liquid. These vibrational sum frequency studies show that a large portion of interfacial water molecules have remarkably weak or negligible hydrogen bonding interactions with other interfacial water molecules, in contrast to the enhanced water structure commonly invoked by the standard picture of hydrophobic hydration. These weakly interacting interfacial water molecules nevertheless are oriented by interactions with the organic phase, and some can change orientation with variation of the aqueous-phase pH.We used total internal reflection (TIR) vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) (8)(9)(10) in these studies as a molecular probe of the hydrogen

This simple estimate is in excellent agreement with the sixfold reduction in transition enthalpies for cyclohexane in 4-nm porous silica, measured by means of DSC (32).Molecules within 2 to 3 nm of the surface are thought to form a layer of thermally fluctuating optical and mechanical properties, as a consequence of the surface-induced decoupling of energy and density changes.

Consequently, volume contributions to the free energy (e.g., intermolecular potential and entropy), which are the basis of the known phase diagram (26)(27)(28), are progressively balanced by interfacial contributions (29). Under confinement, cyclohexane is known to exhibit a depression of phase-transition temperatures (2,(30)(31)(32) and a reduction of normalized enthalpies (32), as well as lower critical points (31,33,34).

Recent molecular dynamics simulations (30) of this interface are consistent with our observations. The combined areas under the peaks corresponding to these oriented and weakly bonded water molecules [that is, those that straddle the interface (nos. 4 and 2) and in-terfacial water monomers/HB acceptors (no.3)] make the most substantial contribution to the VSF spectrum and consequently represent the majority of the water molecules in the interfacial region. Although quantitative comparison of peak areas is complicated by the fact that increased hydrogen bonding results in stronger OH stretch intensity (17), such trends would support an even stronger dominance in the proportion of weakly interacting interfacial water molecules at these organic/water interfaces. The spectra do not provide support for commonly accepted models of an increase in the coordination number of water molecules at an organic/water interface and/or a strengthening of the hydrogenbonding network between water molecules, both which would appear as a growth in intensity at lower frequencies rather than as an observed reduction in intensity in this region.These studies demonstrate that dipolar interactions between interfacial water molecules and the polarizable organic phase play an important role in the interfacial region, resulting in strong orientation effects.
