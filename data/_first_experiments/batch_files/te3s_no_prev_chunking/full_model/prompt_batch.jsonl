This paper proposes a fault analysis method of motors based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis. To achieve this goal, fault fuzzy production rules of three-phase induction motors are first proposed. Then, the rMFRSNPS is presented to model the rules, which provides an intuitive way for modelling the motors. Moreover, to realize the parallel data computing and information reasoning in the fault prediction and diagnosis process, three reasoning algorithms for the rMFRSNPS are proposed: the pulse value reasoning algorithm, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm, and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm. Finally, some case studies are given, in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMonodirectional tissue P systems with promoters\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBSSong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXXZeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJiang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Cybernetics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t51\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMonodirectional tissue P systems with channel states\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBSong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXZeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tARodr\u00edguez-Pat\u00f3n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInformation Sciences\n\t\t\n\t\t\t546\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2021\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLocal synchronization on asynchronous tissue P systems with symport/ antiport rules\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLPan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAlhazov\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHSu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBSong\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Nanobioscience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t19\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tModeling fault propagation paths in power systems: a new framework based on event SNP systems with neurotransmitter concentration\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXWei\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTHuang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Access\n\t\t\n\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA novel controllable crowbar based on fault type protection technique for DFIG wind energy conversion system using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tONoureldeen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIHamdan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProtection and Control of Modern Power Systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAdaptive fault diagnosis of motors using comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer with fuzzy petri net\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXZCheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCGWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMLi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComputing and Informatics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t39\n\t\t\t1-2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDetection and localization of asymmetry in stator winding of three phase induction motors based on fuzzy neural petri net\n\t\t\n\t\t\tATRadhi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Engineering Science and Technology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t15\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAn approach for threephase asynchronous motor failure analysis based on fuzzy fault petri net\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXZCheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYJYu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTransactions of China Electrotechnical Society\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\t17\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNomenclature\nES:Expert system ANN:Artificial neural network PN:Petri net SNPS: Spiking neural P system rMFRSNPSs: Modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers PVRA:Pulse value reasoning algorithm FFPRA:Forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm BAFDRA:Backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm MCS:Minimum cut set PMCS:Precise minimum cut set PN:Proposition neuron RN:Rule neuron MSAF-12:Method of selection of amplitudes of frequencies FPN:Fuzzy petri net FFPN:Fuzzy fault petri net IAAC:Improved artificial ant clustering.\nConflicts of InterestAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMoving integration filter-based open-switch fault-diagnosis method for threephase induction motor drive systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSShi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYSun\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHDan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification\n\t\t\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The photochemistry Therefore, dongle is promising for the potential treatment of IoMT chronic diseases. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe correspondence curve for our photochemical guidelines In the photo 4. The concentration for the TC study can be shown to be between 0.9405, 0.271 and 0.895 and vary between 2.63 mmol/l and 6.96 mmol/l TG calculation concentration. The coefficient of intercept -0.08 is 0.94 mmol/L at a median length of 4.35 mmol/L and the coefficient of association is 0.9345. For HDL-C measurement, the standard ranges from 1.2 mmol/L to 3.3 mmol/L with a pitch of 0.91, 0.17 intercept and 0.952 coefficient of correlation.  There are the following: For 3 years, repetitive sample experiments have been performed. As illustrated Table 1 indicates an average mean of 4.027% of the cv.

Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSerum from the sevoflurane patient reduced NK cell activating receptor CD16, IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, all thus lowering the activity level of NK cells [22,23].\nPro-tumor effectsIn 2002, Garib et al. observed that propofol (3-9 \u03bcg/mL) increased migration of MDA-MB-468 cells [24]. They also found that propofol increased intracellular calcium and altered the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of these cells [25]. These effects of propofol were inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. The group tested the hypothesis that propofol was acting via GABA-A receptor chloride channels. Although they found evidence for the gamma subunit of the GABA-A receptor and the effect of propofol was inhibited by the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline, they did not provide evidence for functional channels in the cells.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n6 h)et al(MTT)Yu et ala MDA-MB-435 2 (10 \u03bcM)6\u2193 (TUNEL stain)Siddiqui et al MDA-MB-23120 (100 \u03bcM) 24\u2193 (WST-1)No change (8 \u03bcm pores,4 h, 5 \u03bcg/ml)Garib et alMDA-MB-4683-91 0\u2191 (collagen matrix, video tracking)Meng et alMDA-MB-2312-1012-24\u2191 (MTT, 10 h)\u2191 (wound healing)\nTable 22Clinical trials comparing volatile anesthetics with propofol in breast cancer surgeryGA general anesthesia, TIVA total intravenous anesthesia, TCI target-controlled infusion, NK cell natural killer cellType of Study ReferenceCancerSurgeryAnestheticNumber of PatientsOutcome (95% CI)EstimatedTypeTechniqueCompletionDateRetrospective Enlund et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDifferences in overall survival rates (propofol vs sevoflurane) for breast cancer were 3% (95% confidence interval, 1 to 4%, p < 0.001) at 1 year, and 2% (-2 to 6%, non-significant) at 5 years, in favor of propofol. However, the observed differences were eliminated after adjustment for confounders (history of cardiac ischemia was 1.8 times more likely in the sevoflurane group) [47]. The second study analyzed 325 patients with 173 in the propofol group and 152 in the sevoflurane group. No difference was observed in the overall 5-year survival rate between two groups, although the propofol group did have a lower rate of cancer recurrence (p = 0.037) [48]. The third study collected 2645 cases, which included 2589 in the volatile anesthesia group and 56 in the propofol group.

This work contributes to the knowledge of research and development trends of the textile manufacturing and apparel industry in a macroscopic way. The Web of Science database and the core set of the Web of Science was explored and 2852 articles in the related fields are identified from 2010 to 2019. The scientific knowledge map of the textile manufacturing technology industry is explored using CiteSpace software. For the last decade, the developmental status, research hotspots and developmental trends of the textile manufacturing and apparel industry are analysed and summarised from the perspectives of key words, hot trends and core authors. The outcomes obtained reveal that in the past 10 years, through the analysis of the technical literature of the textile manufacturing industry, different perspectives were explored where the textile manufacturing industry develops from the initial textile manufacturing treatment. The decolourisation and removal of azo dyes and other traditional textile manufacturing to the composite materials, cotton fabrics leads to the improvement of textile manufacturing wastewater treatment. Currently, the textile manufacturing industry technology has gradually developed towards an intelligent knowledge visualization and decision support. Therefore, this work suggests the developmental directions of textile manufacturing from traditional to intelligent trends, further providing a reference for the later developmental trend and the dynamic planning of China\u2019s textile manufacturing industry technology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nVisual analysis of time-series similarities for anomaly detection in sensor networks Computer graphics forum\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSteiger\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNormalisation techniques for collaborative networks\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNVafaei\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tKybernetes\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA route stability-based multipath QoS routing protocol in cognitive radio ad hoc networks\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSAlqahtani\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAlotaibi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWireless Network\n\t\t\n\t\t\t25\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIndustry 4.0: a survey on technologies, applications and open research issues\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of industrial information integration\n\t\t\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRRPawlak\n\t\t\n\t\tSolving Complex industrial problems without statistics\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCRC Press\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAn overview on corporate response towards sustainability issues in Textile manufacturing industry\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADesore\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSANarula\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ].

In Chagas disease, pleiotropic cytokine TNF is considered key in immunopathology. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the levels of TNF, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in the serum of patients with chronic Chagas disease. TNF and its soluble receptors were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array in the serum of 132 patients, of which 51 had the indeterminate form (IND), 39 the mild cardiac form (CARD 1), 42 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 non-infected individuals (NI). The results indicate that the soluble receptors may regulate TNF in Chagas disease, as their leves were higher in T. cruzi-infected individuals when compared to non-infected individuals. We found a moderate negative correlation between sTNFR1 and TNF in individuals with the IND form, suggesting a relationship with non-progression to more severe forms, such as heart disease. sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were increased in all clinical forms, but with a moderate positive correlation in more severe patients (r = 0.50 and p = 0.0005). TNF levels showed no statistical differences in the groups of patients. These findings suggest the importance of the endogenous balance of the levels of soluble TNF receptors in the protection and balance in patients with chronic Chagas disease, besides revealing the immunological complexity in chronic T. cruzi-infected individuals. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNI vs All chagasic patients: p < 0.0001.\nJos\u00e9 Lira Torres: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Visualization.

We investigated the association of physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process with blood glucose level. Methods 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET scans acquired from 44 patients (male:female=20:24, age=50.8\u00b114.8y [mean\u00b1SD]) were retrospectively analyzed. The blood glucose level (BGL) was examined before 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC injection. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and patients with BGL over 200\u00a0mg/dl were excluded. 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake was measured by the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). Additionally, SSTR-positive volume (SV) in the pancreas uncinate process was measured with two diferent thresholds: by SUV cutof of 2.5 (SV2.5) and 40% of SUVmax (SV40%). These measurements on 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET were correlated with BGL. Results The mean of SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process was 6.51\u00b12.04. SV2.5 was 17.81\u00b17.14 cm3 , and SV40% was 18.20\u00b18.83 cm3 . A signifcant negative correlation was found between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BGL (r=-0.37, p=0.01). The ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the pancreas body also showed a signifcance negative correlation with BGL (r=-0.40, p=0.01).

Codon optimization is a frequently used strategy to accelerate protein synthesis rate. Besides regulating protein translation speed, codon usage bias has also be reported to affect co-translation folding and transcription. P. pastoris is a well-developed expression system, whose efficiency is tightly correlated with commercial value. However, few studies focus on the role of codon usage bias in affecting protein expression in P. pastoris. Besides, many genes in P. pastoris genome show significant negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency. It's not known whether this feature is important for their expression. In order to answer these questions, we picked 4P. pastoris gene candidates with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder. We then performed full-length codon optimization which completely eliminated the correlation. Protein and RNA assays were then used to compare protein and mRNA levels before and after codon optimization. As a result, codon optimization failed to elevate their protein expression levels, and even resulted in a decrease. As represented by the trypsin sensitivity assays, codon optimization also altered the protein structure of 0616 and 0788. Besides protein, codon optimization also affected mRNA levels. Shown by in vitro and in vivo RNA degradation assays, the mRNA stability of 0616, 0788 and 0135 were also altered by codon optimization. For each gene, the detailed effect may be related with its specific sequence and protein structure. Our results suggest that codon usage bias is an important factor to regulate gene expression level, as well as mRNA and protein stabilities in P. pastoris. \"Extreme\" codon optimization in genes with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency may not be favored. Compromised strategies should be tried if expression is not successful. Besides, codon optimization may affect protein structural conformation more severely in structural disordered proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \ncodon usage bias has been studied for a long time.

Some require this external circuit to be changed during the run due to coagulopathy or mechanical failure. Circuit change(s) can result in massive fluid shifts, weight gain, and hemodynamic instability, with negative implications for the patient. Predictors for undergoing circuit changes and its impact on outcomes remain unclear. We hypothesized that circuit changes during ECMO support would correlate with increased morbidity and mortality.\nMethods\nPatients with one ECMO run lasting 30 days or less at a tertiary children\u2019s hospital between 2010-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. LASSO logistic regression models were built to identify independent predictors for undergoing a circuit change. Bivariate regression analysis was used to compare outcomes in patients undergoing a circuit change to those who did not. Primary outcome of interest was mortality on ECMO; secondary outcomes included major bleeding, neurologic, and infectious morbidities; p<0.05 was significant.\nResults\nOne hundred ninety-one patients were included; 144 (75%) had no circuit change, while 47 (25%) had one or more circuit change(s). Lower gestational age at birth (p=0.04), higher WBC (p=0.03), higher platelet transfusion during ECMO (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for undergoing a circuit change. Compared to those who did not undergo a circuit change, patients who did had longer median ECMO duration (p<0.001), higher rates of bleeding complications (p=0.02), and higher mortality (p=0.03).\nConclusion\nChanging the circuit while on ECMO support was associated with longer ECMO duration, higher mortality, and higher bleeding complications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nLASSO logistic regression models were built to identify independent predictors for undergoing a circuit change.

[citation 11] proposed a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Target positioning based on particle centroid drift in large-scale WSNs \nAbstract: The localization problem of target nodes remains unresolved, especially in large-scale and complex environments. In this paper, we propose a particle centroid drift (PCD) algorithm to reduce the distance errors between nodes and obtain the particle aggregation region by using the drift vector. First, we use the particle quality prediction function to obtain the particles in a high-likelihood region. The high-quality particles have high probability in the calculation, which can increase the number of effective particles and enable avoiding particle degradation. Then, the centroid drift vector is used to make the particle distribution similar to the actual reference distribution. Experiments are conducted on state-space models: the local movement where 55% nodes are moving and the globe movement where 100% nodes are moving. The results show that the proposed algorithm has low estimation errors, a good tracking effect and an acceptable time complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWhen the number of beacon packets exceeds a specified threshold, the node is determined to be the centroid of a polygon. Correspondingly, the centroids of its neighboring nodes are viewed as its estimation.Although the traditional PF algorithm can perform node position estimation in non-linear and non-Gaussian WSNs, it has the particle degradation problem which means particles in the higher likelihood region have bigger weights and particles that do not intersect with the prior distribution region have weights close to 0. This problem can be well addressed by predicting the posterior distribution of high-quality particle populations. PQP algorithm can be applied in this respect.Because nodes in large-scale WSNs are movable, we must consider the distances between them when they are moving. However, frequent calculation of the distances leads to high time complexity and more importantly influences the positioning accuracy significantly. The centroid algorithm is range-free and does not depend on Euclidean distance, which can estimate the node positions by using observable moving nodes nearby.When the nodes move to complex boundaries where the coverages of nodes are coupled and crossed, the centroid solution is very time-consuming.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe moment equation is adopted to avoid the complex matrix calculation which turns out to be effective in terms of tracking and convergence.\u2022 A series of experimental evidences are provided based on two different state-space models. Compared to the public benchmark algorithms, results the PCD produced have shown better performance in terms of estimation errors and tracking effects.The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the related work. Section III provides details of the proposed algorithm. Section IV validates our approach through experimental simulations. Section 5 draws some conclusions.\nII. RELATED WORKMany filtering algorithms can improve the estimation accuracy in dynamic networks. The classic filter algorithms in terms of WSN positioning include the Wiener filter, least square filter, Kalman filter and its extensions (e.g., EKF and UKF), the PF, etc. [22], [24].Typically, the PF algorithm is used to handle nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering problems when the target nodes are deployed in large-scale and complex environments. Pak et al. [25] proposed a distributed and PF-based range-free algorithm to alleviate the transmission interruption of indoor wireless signals. Ahmed et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe cubature Kalman filter and Gauss-Newton iterative methods were used to measure the posterior state. This work provided the suggested distribution for the PF and improved the positioning accuracy. V\u00e1zquez and M\u00edguez [28] introduced a distributed PF algorithm based on the posterior probability and combined it with Bayesian estimation. Experimentally, this method is superior to the distributed PF in terms of the positioning accuracy and robustness.In summary, most existing works combined the range-based and range-free methods and used additional auxiliary filters to improve the positioning accuracy. However, they did not consider the particle degradation problem and ignored the influence of various intricate environmental factors (such as the number of deployed nodes, the mobility, and the path loss factor) and PF parameters (such as the number of generated particles, the noise variation and the particle population mobility) on the positioning accuracy of the target node. In addition, they were limited by their computational complexity and convergence speed, hindering them from being applicable in a large-scale and complex environment.\nIII. PROPOSED ALGORITHMThe target node periodically broadcasts beacon packets to neighboring nodes, and each beacon packet contains its identification number and location coordinates.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Melanoma care and survival can be improved by early diagnosis, which can be facilitated by the use of noninvasive imaging modalities. Here we review 5 modalities available in clinical practice. Total body photography is used to follow patients at high risk for melanoma by detecting new lesions or subtle changes in existing lesions. Dermoscopy is an effective noninvasive technique for the early recognition of melanoma by allowing clinicians to visualize subsurface structures. Computer-assisted diagnostic devices are fully automated analysis systems with the capacity to classify lesions as benign or malignant with limited involvement from clinicians. Confocal scanning laser microscopy is an in vivo and noninvasive technology that examines the skin at a resolution comparable to that of histology. High-resolution ultrasound is an adjunct diagnostic aid mainly for the early detection of lymph node metastasis. Applications and limitations of each technology are discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs with many novel technologies, the high cost and bulky design of current CSLM devices are considered to be major barriers. Efforts, such as miniaturizing the device and lowering the cost of production can facilitate wider adoption. In addition, extensive training in both the acquisition and the interpretation of CSLM images is needed. Like dermoscopy, there is a steep learning curve to master the interpretation of CSLM images. Lastly, the technology has intrinsic limitations where CSLM evaluation can give rise to false-positive or falsenegative results. 64,78,79 \nHigh-Resolution UltrasoundMedical ultrasonography is an ultrasound-based diagnostic imaging modality used to visualize body tissue in real time. Modern ultrasound devices are both portable and relatively inexpensive when compared with other imaging modalities. The ultrasound technology is based on pulse-echo systems in which acoustic pulses are generated by a transducer and propagated to the body tissue. The return waves (echo) from the tissue are detected and converted into images for visual inspection. The resolution of the image and depth of tissue penetration is largely dependent on the frequency of the ultrasound transducer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n93,94 However, currently, ultrasound has not demonstrated an adequate level of consistency and reliability. It is not uncommon to overestimate melanoma thickness in the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates and nevus remnants, or to underestimate thickness if small clusters of melanoma cells are located deep in the dermis. 88,95 The value of ultrasound in diagnosing melanoma is limited, but it is useful for assessing lymph node status. Despite being safe and relatively inexpensive, this technology is largely unused by dermatologists in the United States. 96 The major barrier to adopting this technology is that most clinicians are not formally trained to use and interpret the information.\nConclusionsAttempts to reduce melanoma mortality have been focused on prevention and early detection. To this end, several imaging modalities have been developed to aid in the early diagnosis and screening of a high-risk population. To date, TBP and dermoscopy are proven technologies that are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible to practicing physicians. Both technologies can dramatically improve the clinical care of patients at high risk for melanoma. Computer-assisted diagnostic systems are a promising technology currently employed in a limited number of academic settings and specialty clinics.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHigh-frequency (ie, short wavelength) scanners offer greater resolution (eg, axial resolution of 10 m and lateral resolution of 30 m) but poorer tissue penetration (eg, \u03fd2 mm). In dermatology, high-frequency (eg, \u03fe20 MHz) ultrasound is used to evaluate lesions near the skin surface. For assessment of melanocytic lesions, 50-to 100-MHz ultrasound is needed. 48,80,81 The application of ultrasound in the clinical management of melanoma is limited. The technology is useful to aid the detection of lymph node metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanoma. [82][83][84] Physical examination alone often fails to detect locoregional metastases or cannot unambiguously classify palpable lymph nodes. High-resolution ultrasound has been shown to have remarkable superiority over physical examination. The authors of a number of studies 84,85 have reported high sensitivity and specificity (\u03fe90%) for detection of locoregional metastasis with the aid of ultrasound. In addition, ultrasound can be used to differentiate reactive and malignant lymph nodes based on size, shape, border, and echo density of the lymph node.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Health information from traditional, online and social media may influence vaccine hesitancy. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of exposure to COVID-19 information from various media on vaccine hesitancy, as well as the mediating roles of public trust in government and vaccine confidence. With a sample of 438 online participants (mean age = 30.69 years) responding to an anonymous questionnaire, the study tested a mediation model using bias-corrected bootstrap. The results indicated that exposure to COVID-19 information from online news media and traditional media can reduce vaccine hesitancy indirectly. Whereas a positive and indirect relationship between COVID-19 information exposure on social media and vaccine hesitancy was revealed. Trust in government and vaccine confidence were found to be salient mediators between exposure to COVID-19 information from various media and vaccine hesitancy. Findings from this study offer implications for strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOne plausible reason is that social media contain a fair amount of misinformation that was closely related to public health (Bode & Vraga, 2018;Chou et al., 2018). Given that COVID-19 vaccine development was compressed in time, and news about temporary side effects of the vaccines has been reported and raised global concerns, it is worrying that misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors about COVID-19 and vaccines against the disease were spread widely on the internet (Duffy, 2020;Liu & Huang, 2020). Individuals who relied on social media for COVID-19 related information were more likely to be misinformed by disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines (Burki, 2020;Wilson & Wiysonge, 2020). The spread of disinformation and misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media can weaken people's confidence in vaccine safety and increase vaccine hesitancy.The findings of this study hold valuable practical implications. First, during the outbreak of a pandemic, media environments are of particular importance that determines one's vaccination decisions.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSocial media, while providing an unprecedented capacity for the public to stay informed on COVID-19 updates, has been a major channel that fuels unsubstantiated rumors regarding COVID-19 and vaccinations that jeopardize public health. Thus, reconciling principles of online information with the policing of social media for malicious falsehoods remains a conundrum. It is imperative for policymakers to invest in digital and media literacy as a solution to disinformation. Second, given the different influence of COVID-19 information exposure, trust in government and vaccine confidence on vaccine hesitancy. Practitioners should use cross-media strategies to communicate tailed information to enhance public trust and confidence toward the government and vaccines. For instance, through traditional news media, online news media, and social media, we should continue to provide vaccine-hesitant individuals with evidence-based information about the ongoing government activities for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, single-item measures were used to investigate participants' COVID-19 information exposure on traditional news media, online news media, and social media, and this might incur measurement errors. Future research should use multiple items to ensure adequate reliability (e.g. internal consistency).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy November 2021, there were about 250 million confirmed cases worldwide and well over 5 million deaths. In the past year, nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cancelling mass gathering activities, travel restrictions, and mandating social distancing) were implemented by countries to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 (Dinleyici et al., 2020;Liu, 2021Liu, , 2020)). In the meanwhile, health experts recognize COVID-19 vaccination as one of the most important measures for combating COVID-19 infection (Dinleyici et al., 2020). Recently, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has begun in many countries, such as the United States, Russia, and China (Smith et al., 2020). However, an alarming number of people are highly suspicious of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and refuse immunization, a behavior defined as vaccine hesitancy (Featherstone et al., 2019;Getman et al., 2018).

Safe fatigue lives of the NE, SiC, and Al2O3-SAJs were estimated at different reliability levels. The experimental measurements revelated that reducing the adhesive layer thickness from 0.25 mm to 0.17 mm result in enhancing the tensile strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs by 9.6% and 4.4%, respectively, in return of 9.5% and 5.4% for the Al2O3-SAJ relative to the NE-SAJ. The strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs with 0.17 mm bond thickness are higher than those of the Al2O3-SAJ by 15.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The highest improvement of 22.0% in the fatigue strength was occurred for the SiC-SAJ with bond thickness of 0.17 mm in return of 4.8% for the Al2O3-SAJ. The Up was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints practically the change in the enclosed area of the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large variation in the tan \u03b4, E'', and Ud. Damping factor of the NE-SAJs is marginally increased with the stress levels compared to the aggravated increase of both SiC and Al2O3-SAJs. Zhang model predicts well the potential energy and storage modulus specially at higher stress levels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis result is consistent with decreasing the storage modulus (E'), which has a linear inverse relationship with Potential energy (U p ).Potential energy (U p ) was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints in which the variation in the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large change in the factor (tan \u03b4), loss modulus (E''), and dissipated energy (U d ).Zhang model predicts well the experimental measurements of the potential energy and storage modulus (E 0 ) specially at higher stress levels (i.e., high damage) at which they follow a sigmoid curve with constant increasing/ decreasing rates during the most lifetime of the joint.At lower stress level (\u03c3 max = 59.4 MPa), the potential energy of the Al 2 O 3 -SAJs exhibited increasing rate during stage II that agrees well with Zhang sigmoid curve compared to both NE and SiC -SAJs. This behavior consistent with the lower fatigue lives, higher ratcheting strains, larger enclosed area by the hysteresis loops, and lower stiffness of the Al 2 O 3 -SAJs compared to the SiC-SAJs.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBox 80204\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21589\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeddah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaudi Arabia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPotential energy as a new approach for detection and monitoring of fatigue damage in scarf adhesive joints modified with nanoparticles\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t199025FD769ECCF79027690CAD79CAAF\n\t\t\t\t\t10.1177/00219983221091871\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tscarf adhesive joints\n\t\t\t\t\tnano silicon carbide\n\t\t\t\t\tcyclic stress-strain curve\n\t\t\t\t\tstiffness degradation\n\t\t\t\t\tpotential energy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn this study, fatigue results of the scarf adhesive joints (SAJs) were extensively analyzed regarding the effect of the adhesive materials (neat epoxy (NE), and SiC and Al 2 O 3 -nanocomposite), bond thickness (0.17 mm and 0.25 mm) on their dynamic properties, which include loss factor (tan \u03b4), loss modulus (E''), dissipated energy (U d ), potential energy (U p ), and storage modulus (E').\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWaste size and lay up sequence strategy for reusing/recycling carbon fiber fabric in laminate composite: mechanical property analysis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMYShiino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTcgCip\u00f3\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVDonadon\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Compos Mater\n\t\t\n\t\t\t55\n\t\t\t28\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2021\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of interfacial properties between fibre and polymer matrix in composite materials-A critical review\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSHuang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQFu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLYan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Mater Res Technol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2021\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRecycling technology of epoxy glass fiber and epoxy carbon fiber composites used in aerospace vehicles\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRTSelvan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPcvRaja\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPMangal\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Compos Mater\n\t\t\n\t\t\t55\n\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2021\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The study found that the research on ceramic textilesis currently in the extension stage, the papers published by Chinese scholars rank first in the world, but the importance is low.\nThe research has gone through three stages, research hotspots include ceramic textile composite performance, preparationtechnology, heat preservation, composite material preparation, and application, etc, \u201cmicrostructure\u201d, \u201crefinement\u201d and\u2018temperature\u2019 are research hotspots in this field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the table, China's intermediary centrality is lower than that of the United Kingdom and even France, which ranks sixth in publications, the analysis believes that academic exchange activities are mainly caused by the country's geographic location, lower than the academic exchanges between European and American countries [17].\nDistribution of institutionsThrough the analysis of the distribution of research institutions, in addition to getting rid of the overall situation of the country, we can explore the current key research institutions in this field, this is the focus of academic research in this field, it is also convenient for researchers to understand the distribution of research forces in this field.

Blockchain technology as a secure and low-cost platform to track the billions of eventual transactions in a distributed energy economy has attracted the attention of experts in various fields of science. The current form of centralized energy trading system is still suffering from security concerns, quality of service, and to name a few. A decentralized energy system using blockchain technology allows the parties to create a trading energy transaction via microgrid. The blockchain technology offers the promise of an immutable, single source of truth from multiple sources without a third-party involvement. In this paper, we describe, explore and analyze the prominent implementation of blockchain technology in the energy sector. Furthermore, we analyze the security issues and highlight the performance of several attacks that might be occurred in the proposed system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn proof of work, blocks are made by mining, which keeps the blockchain safe. A probability of finding nNonce of proof H for given target T is:\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b \u2264 \ud835\udc47) = \ud835\udc47 2 256(1)The disadvantage of proof-work is related to efficiency, which wastes too many computational resources to find the target value (hash puzzle). The hash in PoW begins with several zero-bit hashes (SHA-256) and involves scanning for value when hashing data.\nB. RESILIENT OVERLAY NETWORKAn extensive distributed system is an overlay network that delivers content, applications, and services to a global audience [22]. The chord algorithm in the overlay network provides a fast-distributed computation of hash function mapping keys to nodes responsible for them. It uses consistent hashing [23], which has several good properties. With high probability, when a \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\u210e node joins (or leaves) the network, only an O(1/N) fraction of the keys are moved to a different location. This is the minimum necessary to maintain a balanced load [24]. Fig. 3 shows a possible three-layered software structure for a cooperative mirror system.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe algorithm of energy trading between the payer and payee is also given in this paper. If there is any dispute during the transaction, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) can solve the problems among the parties. The authors did not elaborate on the attacker's performance, such as selfish mining, eclipse attack, and double spending attack in the model.Imbault et al. [9] proposed the green blockchain concept for managing energy and exploring and creating a green certificate in an eco-district. There are no details \n45related to the security issues in this system. Recently, Danzi et al. [10] showed the concept of distributed proportional fairness control via a blockchain smart contract. The study aimed to enhance efficiency, especially regarding transmission losses in the smart grid.\nII. RESEARCH METHOD A. FUNDAMENTAL OF BLOCKCHAINThe blockchain network can be described as a data structure used to create ledgers containing much transaction information [11]- [13]. As it has for centuries, commerce relies on trust and verified identity with cryptography protocol modules embedded in the system to ensure the credibility of the data and other security manners.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nChord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet applications\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIStoica\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMorris\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDKarger\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMFKaashoek\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHBalakrishnan\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1145/964723.383071\n\t\n\t\n\t\tACM SIGCOMM Comput.

Intelligent Security Analysis Methods Using Big Data The existing technologies against cyber-attacks utilize network-based security devices such as an IDS (intrusion detection system) or IPS (intrusion prevention system), as well as the technologies that are designed to prevent information leakage from the inside, such as antivirus, database encryption, or other technologies to prevent information theft. In addition, such conventional technologies use integrated security management methods that manage the logs of security products on different models. In particular, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and anti-virus technologies are focused on the development of the platform technology needed to apply signature or blacklist-based detection methods to 10Gbp-level high-performance networks. Also, the changes in the key technologies to counter cyber-attacks were based on integrated security management technologies, and it is expected that an intelligent security analysis model using big data will be the prominent topic of the future.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe analysis of unknown, recent attacks may also help such efforts. In particular, there is a need for methods to respond to and defend against the next generation of cyber-attacks, which disguise themselves as normal activities, as is the case with zero-day vulnerabilities and socialengineering methods. These attacks exploit the weakness of signature database-based detection technology, which thus should be complemented by new technology. In addition, there is a need for a specialized analysis method for the intelligent security analysis utilizing big data, as well as technologies for storing and high-speed processing of distributed searching to support it. In this study, the author performed an empirical study on an intelligent security analysis method utilizing big data, which has been gaining attention recently, while examining the changes in the technologies used in cyber-attacks, which are continuously growing smarter, and the technologies to protect against them.In Chapter 2 of this article, the author conducted a literature review that describes the evolution of cyber-attack technologies, which is followed by Chapter 3 in which the intelligent security analysis method utilizing big data is presented. In Chapter 4, the author explains the intelligent behavioral analysis and verification methods. Finally, Chapter 5 provides the conclusion and suggestions for future research.\nLiterature review1.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consider the first computing problem utilizing a minimum solution matrix. A convex infinite set is generated by a restricted number of closed intervals. Second, computing is an objective-domain nonlinear mathematical optimization problem. A multi-objective optimization problem is used to solve the second programming challenge. The constraint set must be used. Use discrete optimization techniques and branch-and-bound procedures for \u201cdigital integer linear programming\u201d. Our technique has been shown to be both practical and successful. The programming complexity increases as the organization expands. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nProblem (3) can be solved using the idea of a minimal solution matrix presented by Yang et al. While Yang's method fails to provide the whole solution set to the problem, this paper will prove that (3). We could not employ Yang's methods in the original study since it did not address the bi-level problem. This study seeks to discover the best possible solution to the problem stated above, which is bi-level objective programming (3), (4). The final section of Section 3 looks at the ideal solution set for Problem (3) and measures its quality by utilizing a minimum-maximum norm solution matrix. This chapter studies the problem at the second level (4). We use the set of minimum-norm solutions to solve the problem (4). We have included a mathematical example in Section 5 to show how and why our proposed method might be implemented and would produce accurate results. Section 4 discusses several forms of management requirements in order to highlight multiple kinds of bi-level difficulties.\nYang's method for first level problemsThe optimal solution to the issue addressed in this Section 3. Specifically, Yang's method can only be utilized to discover a limited number of optimum solutions to the given problem (3).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nX 1 (A, b) is an infinite set of optimum solution to Problem (3), sometimes known as X 1 (A, b). As a result, we use an unlimited set of X 1 (A, b) values to look for the most ideal solution, which employs a second optimization objective (Shang et al., 2014). In the above definition, optimizing the second objective given X 1 (A, b). Constraint reuse is a secondlevel issue. To increase non-operational base stations, we must reduce operational base stations. When base stations fail, their maintenance costs fall. The second goal is to reduce base station operating costs.While a non-functional base station has no electro-magnetic strength, a functional base station does. For instance, in order to keep the zero norm of the vector x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 . . . x n ) at the lowest possible level, one must not deploy additional base stations (Alcal\u00e1-Fdez and Alonso, 2015).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAdditionally, system administrators may have additional requirements that must be taken into consideration when single-level optimization is employed. Yang et al. examined single-level min-max programming using a BT-P2P file-sharing system (Rastogi et al., 2015;Bulanov et al., 2004). Guu et al. developed bi-level optimization to achieve a balance of realistic management requirements (Bjorklund et al., 2003;Pedrycz, 1985).As per further explored difficult managerial requirements by creating a three-tiered optimization problem for the firm (Stamou and Tzafestas, 2001;Shieh, 2007). Their solution for bilevel optimization with max-product fuzzy relation inequalities included wireless communication. The goals' aspects allow for both management qualities. Fairness was applied to the wireless communication station system. Growing numbers of individuals utilize wireless communication. Signals, data, and information are delivered by fixed emission basic stations. Start from the premise to n EBSs, for example, A 1 , A 2 , . . .. An (see Fig. 1) (Markovskii, 2005).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Most of them usually assume homogeneous parameters with a specific Gaussian distribution for each domain, ignoring the robust testing of data skewness. This paper proposes to use unsupervised ensemble autoencoders connected to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to adapt to multiple domains regardless of the skewness of each domain. In the hidden space of the ensemble autoencoder, the attention-based latent representation and reconstructed features of the minimum error are utilized. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the sample density in the GMM. When the estimated sample density exceeds the learning threshold obtained in the training phase, the sample is identified as an outlier related to an attack anomaly. Finally, the ensemble autoencoder and the GMM are jointly optimized, which transforms the optimization of objective function into a Lagrangian dual problem. Experiments conducted on three public data sets validate that the performance of the proposed model is significantly competitive with the selected anomaly detection baselines. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBased on this, Vaca and Niyaz (2018), as an extension, proposed a new parameterization method for the standard residual network architecture, which aimed to increase the number of parameters in a limited way in order to improve the level of parameter sharing between domains. However, these early works did not consider the risk of increased computational complexity caused by the large number of model parameters, which makes such models weak with respect to convergence (Injadat, Moubayed and Shami, 2020). In more recent works inspired by the success of transfer learning, Berriel et al. (2019) and Ren and Lee (2018) proposed a combination of serial and parallel network adapters for multidomain data. They obtained domain-related models with adjustable budgets in terms of the number of parameters and computational complexity. To adjust the computational complexity of the network, they adopted a pretrained architecture to derive a specialized deep model for each domain and then incorporated a budget-aware adapter to select the most relevant feature channel to better process the data from the new domain. Among recent works, there are also some studies that improve domain adaptability through adversarial learning.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nExamples of such attacks include disclosure, modification and deletion of specific data, attempts at unauthorized access, manipulation of information, and other malicious behaviors that make a system unreliable and unstable. This damage produces incalculable and disastrous consequences for users of the system (Gong et al., 2019). It is becoming increasingly important to secure users' data through the popularization of networking applications.However, it has always been difficult to develop an effective and compatible method for complex high-dimensional data (Rezvy, Petridis, Lasebae, & Zebin, 2018). With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, methods based on deep learning are envisioned as competent approaches for cyberattack detection. Some scholars have therefore adopted an unsupervised machine learning method with dimension reduction functions, known as the autoencoder framework (Andresini, Appice, Di Mauro, Loglisci, & Malerba, 2019;Xu, Qian, & Hu, 2019), but this kind of method is limited to performing robust anomaly detection for network intrusion data with high dimensionality and sparsity without supervision.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTrainable activation function with differentiable negative side and adaptable rectified point\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKPratama\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tD.-KKang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNeural Networks, and Complex Problem-Solving Technologies\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRobust optimization over multiple domains\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQQian\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSZhu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJTang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRJin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBSun\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHLi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\tthe AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCross-domain self-supervised multi-task feature learning using synthetic imagery\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZRen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYJLee\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\t\tthe IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n\nResults: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nspecificity (Sp), precision, accuracy (Acc) and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC):Sn \u00bc TP TP \u00fe FN Sp \u00bc TN TN \u00fe FP Precision \u00bc TP TP \u00fe FP Acc \u00bc TP \u00fe TN TP \u00fe TN \u00fe FP \u00fe FN MCC \u00bc TP \u00c2 TN \u00c0 FP \u00c2 FN ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u00f0TP \u00fe FP\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TP \u00fe FN\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TN \u00fe FP\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TN \u00fe FN\u00de pwhere TP, TN, FP and FN denote the numbers of true positives (correctly predicted cleavage sites), true negatives (correctly predicted 3 Results and discussion On the other hand, if the target dataset is large or the number of parameters is small,\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDevelopmental and Integrative Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBirmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAL\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTatianaMarquez-Lago\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Genetics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBirmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAL\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuanzhongLiu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollege of Information Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNorthwest A&F University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYangling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t712100\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYanzeWang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollege of Information Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNorthwest A&F University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYangling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t712100\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJericoRevote\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonash Biomedicine Discovery Institute\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonash University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3800\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAIanSmith\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonash Biomedicine Discovery\n\nExcerpt 3: \niLearn: an integrated platform and meta-learner for feature engineering, machine-learning analysis and modeling of DNA, RNA and protein sequence data\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZChen\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1093/bib/bbz041\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBrief.

For each patient cohort, a decision analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions over a 5-year horizon. A Markov process was embedded in the decision model to simulate the possible prognosis of cancer. Data on transition probabilities, survival, side-effects, quality of life and costs were obtained from published sources and the SABR Commissioning through Evaluation (CtE) scheme. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with respect to quality-adjusted life-years. The robustness of the results was examined in a sensitivity analysis. Analyses were conducted from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective.\nResults\nIn the base case analysis, which assumed that all three interventions were associated with the same cancer progression rates and mortality rates, SABR was the most cost-effective intervention for both patient cohorts. This conclusion was sensitive to the cancer progression rate, mortality rate and cost of interventions. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probability that SABR is cost-effective was 57% and 50% in liver oligometastases and HCC, respectively.\nConclusions\nOur results indicate a potential for SABR to be cost-effective for patients with liver oligometastases and HCC. This finding supports further investigation in clinical trials directly comparing SABR with surgery and radiofrequency ablation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCOMMISSIONING THROUGH EVALUATION -Standards for the Provision of 41 Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEngland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\tLondon; NHS England\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tConsolidated 43 Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) Statement\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDHusereau\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMDrummond\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPetrou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCCarswell\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDMoher\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGreenberg\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPharmacoEconomics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t44\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSimultaneous analysis of quality of life and survival data\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLJBillingham\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKRAbrams\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tStatistical 46 Methods in Medical Research\n\t\t\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2002\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDeveloping NICE guidelines: the manual\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\t49\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDeveloping NICE guidelines: the manual\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50 October 2014\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence\n\nExcerpt 2: \nReport of nationally 191 representative values for the noninstitutionalized US adult population for 7 health-related quality-of-192 life scores\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJHanmer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWFLawrence\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPAnderson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMKaplan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGFryback\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMedical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision\n\t\t\n\t\t\t193\n\t\t\t194\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\tMaking\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRadiofrequency Ablation versus Liver Resection for Colorectal 195 Cancer Liver Metastasis: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYHan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDYan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJQCai\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChinese medical journal\n\t\t\n\t\t\t196\n\t\t\t197\n\t\t\t2016\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHospital Birmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Population Health and Environmental Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity College London\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSEddy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Hospital Birmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Population Health and Environmental Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity College London\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJLPeacock\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Hospital Birmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Population Health and Environmental Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity College London\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBCoker\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Hospital Birmingham\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Population Health and Environmental Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity College London\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMRKartha\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRadiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof UK SABR Consortium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKing's Health Economics\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Material and Methods The retrospective study comprised 127 pregnant women with various pregnancy complications between 23 and 39 gestational weeks. Umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms were recorded with Doppler ultrasound and characterized by pulsatility index (PI) and blood flow class (BFC). Doppler audio signals were stored on a digital video recorder and the sound frequency at the energy level 15 dB below its peak (MAXpeak-15 dB) was estimated off-line. The prediction of probability for composite adverse pregnancy outcome (operative delivery for fetal distress, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death) was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Results With increasing umbilical artery BFC, the MAXpeak-15 dB frequencies decreased (p < 0.0001) and the PI increased (p < 0.0001). The ROC AUCs for adverse outcome for MAXpeak-15 dB and for PI were 0.842 and 0.836 (p = 0.88), respectively. For the combination of MAXpeak-15 dB and PI, the corresponding AUC was 0.894, significantly higher than that of PI (p < 0.03) and of MAXpeak-15 dB (p < 0.05). Conclusion Umbilical artery Doppler sound spectrum analysis might be a useful supplement to PI in the clinical evaluation of fetoplacental circulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUse of stereo earphones also allows differentiation between positive and negative (reverse) signals by ear. After the advent of modern ultrasound techniques combining high-resolution imaging, color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler, listening to the signals has been generally abandoned in favor of adjusting the recording situation and optimizing signals by visual control of the Doppler spectrum. Indeed, modern ultrasound systems do not provide an output for audible signals anymore and the quality of built-in loudspeakers is usually very poor.   The evaluation of Doppler sound signals by ear is very subjective, highly dependent on the skills and experience of the operator. Consequently, the subjective method is not suitable for more general application. Therefore, we have developed an objective method of analyzing Doppler audio signals and we have identified a new parameter characterizing the sound signalthe maximum frequency at the energy level that is 15 dB below the peak (MAX peak-15 dB ). This new characteristic of the sound signal proved to correlate very well with the subjective classification by operator, both for computer-simulated sound frequencies [22] and for umbilical artery signals recorded from sheep fetuses under various degrees of experimental asphyxia [9].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnalyses of the FFTs were done in the frequency range from 150 Hz, corresponding to the limit of earphones used by the sonographer, to 10,007 Hz, representing the frequency of the band stop of recording. An auditory feature, the high frequency cut-off band was identified within the frequency range [14]. Based on the results of our previous experimental study [9], this high-frequency cut-off (MAX peak-15 dB ) was defined as the frequency band where the energy level had decreased by 15 dB from its maximum level, i. e. from the MAX peak value ( \u2022 \" Fig. 1).The primary outcome variable was the composite adverse pregnancy outcome including perinatal death, operative delivery for fetal distress and admission for treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit. The risk for a negative outcome, given a certain value for artery PI, auditory parameter MAX peak-15 dB, or combination of PI and MAX peak-15 dB , was calculated using logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the areas under the curves (AUC) were used for characterization of the predictive performance of umbilical artery PI and of the auditory parameter MAX peak-15 dB .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn: Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHFastl\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEZwicker\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\tSpringer Verlag\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBerlin\n\t\t\n\t\n\t2nd edition\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tComparing the areas under two or more correlated receiver operating characteristic curves: a nonparametric approach\n\t\t\n\t\t\tERDelong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDMDelong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tClarke-PearsonDl\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBiometrics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t44\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1988\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tUmbilical venous flow in normal and complicated pregnancy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRWGill\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGKossoff\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPSWarren\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUltrasound Med Biol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1984\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMeasurement of human fetal blood flow\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSHEik-Nes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAOBrubakk\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMKUlstein\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBMJ\n\t\t\n\t\t\t281\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1980\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Its main function modules include SD (sales and distribution), MM (material management), PP (production planning), PM (factory maintenance), HR (human resources), and FICO (finance and cost) [citaton 7].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene product SAP regulates signals induced through the co-receptor SLAM \nAbstract: In addition to triggering the activation of B- or T-cell antigen receptors, the binding of a ligand to its receptor at the cell surface can sometimes determine the physiological outcome of interactions between antigen-presenting cells, T and B lymphocytes. The protein SLAM (also known as CDw150), which is present on the surface of B and T cells, forms such a receptor-ligand pair as it is a self-ligand. We now show that a T-cell-specific, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which contains an SH2 domain and a short tall, acts as an inhibitor by blocking recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to a docking site in the SLAM cytoplasmic region. The gene encoding SAP maps to the same area of the X chromosome as the locus for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and we found mutations in the SAP gene in three XLP patients. Absence of the inhibitor SAP in XLP patients affects T/B-cell interactions induced by SLAM, leading to an inability to control B-cell proliferation caused by Epstein-Barr virus infections. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nImmunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS\u00b1PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-SLAM serum (top) or with a rabbit anti-SAP antibody (bottom).A small amount of SAP mRNA detected in the small intestine probably resulted from lymphocyte contamination. In wild-type mice, SAP is expressed in T cells but not in B cells, whereas no mRNA or protein could be detected in CD3e null mice which lack T cells (C.W., J.S. and C.T., manuscript in preparation). Both human mRNA species encoding SAP (2.5 and 0.9 kilobases (kb)) (Fig. 3) were represented among the cDNA clones isolated in the two-hybrid system and encoded the same open reading frame, but differed in their 39 untranslated sequences. Collectively, our results show that, unlike SLAM, SAP is primarily expressed in T cells.SAP is encoded by the XLP disease gene By using a 45-kb pBAC clone that contained all four exons of murine SAP (Fig. 1), the SAP gene was localized within band A5.1 of the murine X chromosome (C.W., J.S. and C.T., manuscript in preparation).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe design of these PCR primers was based on the genomic sequence of human SAP (EMBL database). The PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels, subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. For analysis of a point mutation in the region preceding exon 2, exon 2 PCR products were gel-puri\u00aeed (Qiagen) and digested with the restriction enzyme MnlI (New England Biolabs), followed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 200 volts for 3 h. Rabbit antisera. SLAM Y2, SLAM Y3, hSAP (CQGTTGIREDPDV) and mSAP (CQAPTGRRDSDI) peptides were coupled to KLH (PIERCE) and used to inject New Zealand rabbits. Rabbit antisera were obtained by standard procedures. Plasmid construction, transfection and luciferase assays. Human SAP cDNA was cloned in vector pGEX2T (Pharmacia) to generate a GST\u00b1SAP construct.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo con\u00aerm that the cDNAs were full-length, we also isolated cDNA clones from a human T-cell (Jurkat) library and from a murine (C57B16) thymus library. The predicted human SAP protein comprises a single SH2 domain (residues 6\u00b1102) followed by a short 26-aminoacid tail (residues 103\u00b1128). Human and murine SAP are highly homologous (96%) in both the SH2 and tail domains (Fig. 1). The SAP SH2 domain was clearly related to other SH2 domains, particularly those of SHIP (45%), EAT-2 (40%) and Abl (35%), but its short tail was unlike any known protein domain.Antibodies directed against human or mouse SAP-tail sequences detected a 15K protein in detergent lysates made from either human T cells (Fig. 2a) or murine thymocytes (Fig. 2b). Because the observed relative molecular mass was consistent with the predicted value, our human and mouse SAP cDNAs are unlikely to code for a fragment of a larger protein.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, the existing encryption methods cannot effectively solve the above problems when applied to WSN. To this end, according to WSN\u2019s characteristics and based on the identity-based encryption idea, an improved identity-based encryption algorithm (IIBE) is proposed, which can effectively simplify the key generation process, reduce the network traffic, and improve the network security. The design idea of this algorithm lies between the traditional public key encryption and identity-based public tweezers\u2019 encryption. Compared with the traditional public key encryption, the algorithm does not need a public key certificate and avoids the management of the certificate.

High-resolution radars (HRRs) utilize wideband signals and synthetic apertures to enhance the range and angular resolutions of tracking, respectively. They also generate one-, two-, and even threedimensional high-resolution images containing the feature information of targets, from which the targets can be precisely classified and identified. Advanced signal processing algorithms in HRRs obtain important information such as range-Doppler imaging, phase-derived ranging, and micro-motion features. However, the advantages and applications of HRRs are restricted by factors such as the reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-scatter point targets, decreased tracking accuracy of multi-scatter point targets, high demands of motion compensation, and low sensitivity of the target attitude. Focusing on these problems, this paper systematically introduces the novel technologies of HRRs and discusses the issues and solutions relevant to detection, tracking, imaging, and recognition. Finally, it reviews the latest progress and representative results of HRR-based research, and suggests the future development of HRRs. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWhen designing classifiers at different levels, the classifier must be optimized by considering the physical meanings and statistical distributions of the features. For example, features such as target size and scattering center can be classified by a simple threshold discriminant classifier or a decision tree classifier, whereas the structural and statistical features of the scattering centers can be discriminated by a support vector machine classifier. Before making the final decision, the results of different classifiers can be combined by an ensemble classification method.  For adaptive feature extraction, we can exploit the end-to-end capability of deep neural networks. Deep learning avoids the high dependence of the traditional machine learning algorithm on human experience [118][119][120][121]. Deep neural networks include deep autoencoders, deep convolution neural networks, and deep recurrent neural networks. Among these, the deep convolution neural network is most commonly used. Figure 15 is a block diagram of HRRP recognition using a deep convolution neural network. The network includes a convolution layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The stacked convolution layer and pooling layer map the original data directly to the high-level abstract features, which are then mapped to the target through the fully connected layer. The entire process requires no human intervention.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRadar HRRP target recognition based on t-SNE segmentation and discriminant deep belief network\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMPan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQ PKong\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1109/LGRS.2017.2726098\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Geosci Remote Sens Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHRRP classification based on multi-scale fusion sparsity preserving projections\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWDai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tY\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tElectron Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t53\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBayesian spatiotemporal multitask learning for radar HRRP target recognition\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLDu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tP HWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1109/TSP.2011.2141664\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Trans Signal Process\n\t\t\n\t\t\t59\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe statistical features reflect the amplitude change information, and the structural features reflect the spatial distribution information of the scattering center. The transformation features are extracted by a specific transform of HRRP. The spectral and multi-scale features are obtained by a transform function (such as a Fourier or bispectrum transform) and a wavelet transform, respectively, and the subspace characteristics are formed by dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and local linear embedding.However, the traditional HRRP feature-extraction method requires advanced human experience, and a universal set of features is difficult to form. In specific applications, feature extraction and selection often consume much manpower and time, largely restricting the application of HRRP recognition.In multi-feature recognition, we need to select the appropriate feature subset and construct the corresponding classifier that recognizes different targets in different environments. If all features are fused blindly, the dimension of the feature vector will be greatly increased, which not only increases the computation effort and storage but may also reduce the recognition performance. Moreover, features differ in their physical meanings and usages.A hierarchical recognition method handles different features by different classifiers.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The high-quality image transmission in visual sensor networks (VSNs) consumes more space, energy, transmission delay which may experience the various security threats. Image compression is a key phase of visual sensing systems that needs to be effective. This motivates us to propose a fast and efficient intelligent image transmission module to achieve the energy-efficiency, minimum delay, and bandwidth utilization. Compressive sensing (CS) introduced to speedily compressed the image to reduces the consumption of energy, time minimization, and efficient bandwidth utilization. However, CS cannot achieve security against the different kinds of threats. Several methods introduced since the last decade to address the security challenges in the CS domain, but efficiency is a key requirement considering the intelligent manufacturing of VSNs. Furthermore, the random variables selected for the CS having the problem of recovering the image quality due to the accumulation of noise. Thus concerning the above challenges, this paper introduced a novel one-way image transmission module in multiple input multiple output that provides secure and energy-efficient with the CS model. The secured transmission in the CS domain proposed using the security matrix which is called a compressed secured matrix and perfect reconstruction with the random matrix measurement in the CS. Experimental results outwards that the intelligent module provides energy-efficient, secured transmission with low computational time as well as a reduced bit error rate. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1007/s10845-020-01590-1\n\t\t\t\t\tReceived: 21 October 2019 / Accepted: 13 May 2020\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntelligent module smart system\n\t\t\t\t\tData transmission\n\t\t\t\t\tData compression intelligent sensor\n\t\t\t\t\tVisual sensing automation\n\t\t\t\t\tCoding\n\t\t\t\t\tRegression\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nDue to technology advancement, smart visual sensing required in terms of data transfer capacity, energy-efficiency, security, and computational-efficiency.

Any information that transmits through the channel need not only the compression but also the security from the various cipher attackers such as data exfiltration, bad data injection, etc. Many types of research paved a way to solve the security issues in CS by providing security as a secondary process, which takes more time thus none will show a result as an inbuilt process in CS. Besides, while transmitting into the channel, the noise, which added, should properly estimate on the receiver side so that the input image could reconstruct into their original form.

Is required in a manner. The figure goes through attacks. In addition, the quiesical issue for additional time of pressure is that the auxiliary interaction of pressure occurs through the dewar receiving extra time. To address these issues, compressed sensing emerges, which packs the image into hours of sensing, is generated in an expedient manner that reduces time usage and saves the use of data transfer capability, however Bomb in transmission. A variety of examinations cleared a way for dealing with security issues in compressive sensing (CS) through giving security as an alternative negotiation. In addition, univariate factors opted for CS as the issue of rearranging image quality is because of the aggregation of clutter. Along these lines related to the above issues, this paper proposed two-way image transmission to the Corvus Coron module, which presents an energy-effective with the CS model, as an inbuilt interaction in the CS transmission through the security framework. Receives what was designated as the pack-protected plot. Impeccable entertainment with the famous arbitrary network conjecture in CS.

The two-way transmission of image under a wireless channel needed image must compatible along channel characteristics such as band width, energy-efficient, time consumption and security because the image adopts big space under the device of storage and need a long time that easily undergoes cipher attacks. Moreover, Quizzical the problem for the additional time under compression results that, the secondary process of the compression followed through the acquisition consumes more time.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nHence, for resolving these issues, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged, which compressed the image at the time of sensing emerges as a speedy manner that reduces the time consumption and saves bandwidth utilization but fails under secured transmission. Several kinds of research paved path to resolve the security problems under CS through providing security such as the secondary process.\nFindings\nThus, concerning the above issues, this paper proposed the Corvus corone module two-way image transmission that provides energy efficiency along CS model, secured transmission through a matrix of security under CS such as inbuilt method, which was named as compressed secured matrix and faultless reconstruction along that of eminent random matrix counting under CS.\nOriginality/value\nExperimental outputs shows intelligent module gives energy efficient, secured transmission along lower computational timing also decreased bit error rate. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCompression leads to deterioration of the image content, so pre-processing approaches such as optimization, segmentation and representation need to be Two-way image transmission performed to address these consistency-based issues (Oh and Lei, 2012). Once preprocessed, the image gets formatted through various techniques, resulting under digital form. These digital signals consume large space and more time when it moves through a wireless channel (Yang et al., 2016). The following Figure 1 shows the image transmission process through the channel.The prepared sign should be reformatted during image handling to get the first transmitted image, yet this sign will likewise give repetitive data (Manapragada and Kluesing, 2014). It is additionally imperative to give an appropriate pressure procedure to take out such repetitive information (Qaisar et al., 2013). Compressive sensing [CS] a sensing methodology that packs the sign obtained at the hour of sensing develops and dispenses with the repetitive information (Zhang et al., 2016). Signs can be spoken to as a scanty either compressible structure different area (Marvasti et al., 2012).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHenceforth, to defeat as a joined hotspot for securing, pressure and change, the idea of CS is used through their inclination of dimensional decrease and arbitrary projection, which detected itself and diminishes the data transmission use. This module performs less data transfer capacity use through quantization along choosing the irregular variable under the spatial space as a regularized structure using least squares models and uncovers a considerable sum about the conduct of the estimators under de-quantization.Along this, confusion and scattering of a pandemonium property under a fiddling ringer is used as an arranging condition under quantization, which has the distinguishing strength of seeing just to those unmistakable along the language of the imps so the picture bits cannot be appreciated through figure aggressors, therefore, gives high security to the picture bits. By then to transmit these bits with no curving of signs, there is must have a change plot, which is finished for the transmission under MIMO channel that are allowed to access under the full-duplex channel, which makes to grant under the two course.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nKrishna et al. (2018) used disorganized planning to scramble the image pixels to explicit situations along changes under pixel esteems. The techniques for image encryption are open for image encryption by means of the inherent inward key generator. Hyper-Chaos is portrayed as a clamorous action along at any rate two positive examples of Lyapunov along one zero and one negative type of Lyapunov. For this procedure, the image encryption is accomplished using a two-dimensional hyper-confused guide for change and the making of various hyper-riotous guides for dispersion. The encryption of the image is accomplished through a few muddled guides.\nRelated worksThe above works distinguish considerably testing issues for the two-way image transmission.

In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe service system makes the system's default emergency response and defense strategies not implemented effectively. The common features of these attacks are formulating the corresponding attack strategies for specific business processes and the trusted plans of physical systems, using a network attack technology to implement coordinated attacks on multiple targets, and bypassing physical trusted systems to disrupt the normal operation of the system, even destroying physical equipment [21]- [24]. In the future, based on artificial-intelligence-based autonomous learning and powerful database analysis capabilities, people can anticipate dangers in advance and truly kill threats in the cradle, thereby greatly improving the agility of network physical credibility. The credible control of CPS is shifting from physical credibility to physical and social factors integrated disaster prevention [25]- [28]. However, due to the characteristics of CPS, such as large-scale data processing, continuous online operation of the system, the operators can only conduct closed feedback, and so on, it is urgent to realize the real-time reliability evaluation of CPS. To promote the in-depth integration of informatization and industrialization is to profoundly grasp the characteristics of the era of global informationization and the process of accelerating the convergence of industrialization.\nII.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn order to check the redundancy, first, the history and test system state information instances are transformed into vector groups by using a vector space model. Fig. 8 shows the cascade mean failure probability change caused by the attack. It is known that \u03b8 is the probability of failure caused by the failure of the node itself in the system, \u03c1 is the failure probability caused by all the failures of the neighbor nodes in the system, and \u03b3 is the probability that any node in the system will leave the maximum connectivity graph of the network due to the failure, that is, the average failure of the node probability.The total number of offensive and defensive resources S A and S D are two key factors affecting the level of system vulnerability during the game phase. The sensitivity analysis of them is shown in Fig. 9.The simulation results and the analysis conclusions of this section can help guide the CPS defenders of the distribution network with distributed collaborative control mode and choose how to invest the appropriate amount of defense resources according to the CPS attack and defense environment.In the game phase, in addition to the influencing factors of the network attack and defense, the dynamic convergence process of the distributed collaborative control itself will also affect the system vulnerability assessment results.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIf the following inequality is not true\u03bb low j (k) \u2264 \u03bb j (k) \u2264 \u03bb up j (k)(10)then DG i suspects that it receives the neighbor DG j state abnormality, determines that it is a suspicious node, and prepares to initiate the edge and isolation process; where \u03bb j (k) is the microincrement rate information that DG i receives from DG j. This establishes a detection mechanism for the following DG.On the other hand, in the mechanism for detecting the malicious leader DG, one of the neighboring DGs of the leader DG can be set as the agent leader DG, which is responsible for direct monitoring.

The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach. The experimental results confirm the fact that the proposed model performs better than the existing machine learning models. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNIDS and HIDS sensors are resource expensive and impractical to be deployed covering the entire network. Inability to strategically optimize the usage of IDS could lead to important resources being exposed to adversarial attacks. Any IDS framework comes bundled with pre-defined signatures, which alert to any anomalies in the network traffic. However this framework needs to be customized to adhere to all possible organizational needs. Moreover, investigation of IDS alerts tend to be extremely resource intensive, and might require additional information from other network tools to confirm and decide on the seriousness of the alerts generated. These decisions require security expert personnel capable of the interpretation of system outputs and computing of crucial functions. Hence experienced security experts are required for the remediation, detection and management of such threats [3][4][5].As the dataset used in this work has huge dimension, an effective dimensionality reduction mechanism had to be developed to reduce the burden of the classifier. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction mechanism would facilitate the classifier to choose the most important attributes and eliminate the attributes that have negative impact on the performance of the classifiers. This motivated us to design a model making use of a PCA based firefly algorithm to effectively choose the most relevant attributes from the IDS dataset.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDeep Learning Approach for Intelligent Intrusion Detection System\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRVinayakumar\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMAlazab\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKSoman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPPoornachandran\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAl-Nemrat\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSVenkatraman\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895334\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Access\n\t\t\n\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCybercrime: the case of obfuscated malware\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMAlazab\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSVenkatraman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPWatters\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMAlazab\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAlazab\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGlobal Security, Safety and Sustainability & e-Democracy\n\t\tThessaloniki, Greece\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpringer\n\t\t\t2011\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe authors conclude that Spark-Chi-SVM technique offers higher performance by reducing the training duration and is also effective for Big data scenarios.Machine and deep learning techniques have been significantly implemented for IDS in wireless sensor network (WSN). For observing the major network resources in WSN, the researchers implement Boltzmann machine-based clustered IDS (RBC-IDS), which is a DL-based IDS technique. In the study [17], researchers analyse the performance of RBC-IDS, compare it to the existing adaptive machine learning-based IDS and conclude that the detection duration of RBC-IDS is roughly twice than the ASCH-IDS.Several researchers have used nature-inspired optimization algorithms along with machine learning algorithms for classifying the datasets. Advantages of using nature inspired algorithms is that, they can help the classifiers in overcoming the problem of getting struck at local minima. The authors in [18][19][20][21] propose several hybrid classification models using nature inspired algorithms like cuckoo search, BAT, firefly, genetic algorithms etc, to classify diabetes and heart disease datasets.

The stable growth of migrant children, which affects the sustainable stability of the community, is adversely impacted by sustained pressures without adequate assistance and advice. Therefore, psychological stress from each post on microblog has been established through research focused on detecting migrant children. Nevertheless, after stressful times, it is more important to consider stress from aspect to recognize stressful periods and stressful incidents that cause each stressful period. This paper identifies the problem of the recognition of migrant children in the open social network microblog stressful periods and stressor events. Besides, the improved Poisson-dependent probability model has been developed and focused on the study of the postings of migrant children during stressful activities in schools to compare stressors with a set of postings on Tencent Weibo (microblog). Through this model the average stressed times of migrant children which obtains more information regarding potential stressors affecting stressed periods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMigrant children are now a core tool for the Chinese urban social community. Effective incorporation into urban schools of migrant children is the prerequisite for well-being, financial prosperity, and social stability. However, the dual household registration (hukou) (or ruralurban stratification system) that prevents equitable access to public facilities, including schooling for migrant children (Liu 2013), is among the most compelling structural barriers to integration. There are many drawbacks for students at a traditional migrant school in the residential region of a communityincluding a shortage of teaching positions (Shakeel and Baskar 2020), outdated infrastructure for schooling and inadequate instructional content and equipment. Migrant children are more likely to live in distress relative to the metropolitan equivalent, undergo psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, endure discrimination and victimization and report crime (Joshi et al. 2019). Besides economic drawbacks, the acculturation and well-being of migrant children are further constrained by a lack of cultural resources and social isolation in the region (Fig. 1).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n57)GradesTop 1Top 2RecallPrecisionF1RecallPrecisionF110.650.780.620.760.730.8220.730.640.680.870.790.7630.680.750.790.730.850.71\nTable 44Comparison between the linguistic process between detection of stressors and the predictive methodology of predicting life eventsGrades Extraction of Stressor EventPersonal Event Identification(Top 1)(Top 2)RecallPrecisionF1RecallPrecisionF110.650.780.620.560.670.6520.730.640.680.650.690.6830.680.750.790.590.610.56\nTable 55Five level stress occurrence ratiosLevelGrade 1Grade 2Grade 3self-awareness0.430.460.49school lives0.340.380.31Interaction0.210.270.29Life of the family0.140.170.19Peer Connection0.0430.0370.029\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation Project \"Family language life and language planning of migrant children in Northwest China\" (18XYY008).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe therapy party worked for 1 h a week and completed 10 min of daily assignments for 8 weeks. A better understanding of the feeling correlated with stress may improve the coping ability according to studies of attention training. Even though the growing perception of stressors itself may raise stress as part of the cycle of awareness of cognitive, emotional of social development. It could be necessary to increase stress.The analysis of potential effects on later behavior and neurobiology of early life stress (ERS) in humans is a fast increasing field. Although epidemiologic and neurobiological research offer a dark image of adverse outcomes the scope of the findings surrounding potential emotional and cognitive deficiencies correlated with ELS has not been incorporated. Emerging results of experimental research exploring brain developmental processes in healthy populations will offer a new basis for the understanding of ELS-based sequels (Pechtel and Pizzagalli 2011). The goal is to increase this analysis based on the effects of clinical research on normative brain growth which are outlined.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Firstly, the facial expression image is normalized, and the edge of each layer of the image is extracted in the convolution process. The extracted edge information is superimposed on each feature image to preserve the edge structure information of the texture image. Then, the dimensionality reduction of the extracted implicit features is processed by the maximum pooling method. Finally, the expression of the test sample image is classified and recognized by using a Softmax classifier. To verify the robustness of this method for facial expression recognition under a complex background, a simulation experiment is designed by scientifically mixing the Fer-2013 facial expression database with the LFW data set. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average recognition rate of 88.56% with fewer iterations, and the training speed on the training set is about 1.5 times faster than that on the contrast algorithm. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor more information, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ autistic children and help doctors understand themselves.

The possibility of severe vision loss can be extensively reduced by timely diagnosis and treatment. An automated screening for DR has been identified as an effective method for early DR detection, which can decrease the workload associated to manual grading as well as save diagnosis costs and time. Several studies have been carried out to develop automated detection and classification models for DR. This paper presents a new IoT and cloud-based deep learning for healthcare diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The proposed model incorporates different processes namely data collection, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. At first, the IoT-based data collection process takes place where the patient wears a head mounted camera to capture the retinal fundus image and send to cloud server. Then, the contrast level of the input DR image gets increased in the preprocessing stage using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) model. Next, the preprocessed image is segmented using Adaptive Spatial Kernel distance measure-based Fuzzy C-Means clustering (ASKFCM) model. Afterwards, deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based Inception v4 model is applied as a feature extractor and the resulting feature vectors undergo classification in line with the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model. The proposed model was tested using a benchmark DR MESSIDOR image dataset and the obtained results showcased superior performance of the proposed model over other such models compared in the study. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSeveral DLbased techniques are designed to examine the retinal fundus images and to develop automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models for DR [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22].A novel technology was designed in the literature [8] to determine the disease intensity under cloud and IoT applications. This technique was applied to predict the seriousness of the illness. The above technology was deployed to take unique care of student's and children's health. In this study, a programmatic health information, termed as student data, was created with the help of reputed UCI Repository as well as sensors employed in medical domain. This was deployed also to forecast diverse ailments which have been influenced by student with severity. Followed by, several other classification models were applied to predict different types of diseases. The major application of this algorithm is the determination of prediction accuracy using few attributes like F-measure, specificity as well as sensitivity.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHence, the variables associated with these normal distributions could be derived using,m X l jC\u00bcc \u00bc 1 N c X N c l\u00bc1 x l(21)s 2 X l jC\u00bcc \u00bc 1 N c X N c l\u00bc1 x l 2 \u00c0m 2(22)where N c denotes the count of instance where C \u00bc c whereas N represents the number of overall examples applied in training. By estimating P C \u00bc c \u00f0 \u00de for every class, it becomes simple by applying relevant frequencies in the form of,P C \u00bc c \u00f0 \u00de\u00bc N c N(23)Finally, the classifier outcome by the proposed model is notified to the user using the cloud database server and smart phones.\nPerformance Validation\nDataset DescriptionFor experimentation purposes, a benchmark MESSIDOR DR Dataset was used which had a total of 1,200 color fundus images with annotations in Excel file [24]. The details related to the dataset is shown in the Tab. 1 and the images can be graded into different levels namely level 1, level 2 and level 3. Fig. 3 shows some of the sample test DR images.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAdditionally, the proposed technique was defined with advanced techniques in IoT healthcare. A specific investigation was conducted to provide an overview of state-of-the-art network environment, applications as well as commercial increments in IoT-relied healthcare solutions.A modern clinical analysis system known to be neuro-fuzzy temporal data presentation method was presented in the previous study [17] to detect and diagnose diverse types of deadly diseases. Kakria et al. [18] employed a novel online health care observation technology to monitor the remote heart patients often using mobile phones and wearable sensors. Subsequently, Kim et al. [19] established a technique to monitor the emergency scenario under the application of content of motion tracking disease patients. Some other models are also found in Jebaseeli et al. [20]. Roychowdhury et al. [21] developed a new DREAM: Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Using Machine Learning model which investigates the fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view. The severity level of DR can be generated by the use of ML models such as Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

There have been different biometric traits were used for recognition. The biometric traits, for example: fingerprint, palm veins, iris recognition, retina, face recognition, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), palm print, hand geometry, odor, typing rhythm, gait, and voice which is very appropriate for human recognition because of their singularity, integrality and uniformity. Among all other biometric techniques, fingerprints have the elevated amount of dependability and widely utilized by criminological specialists as a part of criminal examinations. To maintain the security is computationally challenging task for large database. Hence, fingerprint indexing scheme is needed for match the query image against every one of the fingerprints in database.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

An energy efficient clustering method, depending on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the Fractional Artificial Bee Colony (FABC) algorithm, has a propensity to maximize the energy of the network and life time of nodes by the optimal cluster head selection (CHS). When conveying data, an ABC-Dynamic Scout bee algorithm is presented that multiplies the scout bee production to enlarge the number of alive nodes and the of CH energy. An assessment among the performances of the implemented ABC-based Dynamic Scout bee algorithm routing mechanism in opposition to that of ABC-based CHS and FABC-based CHS routing is done. The experimental outcome demonstrates that the implemented method increases the quantity of alive nodes with 25% of maximum energy for the normalized network compared with conventional protocols. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTable 1 shows the comparative analysis of the implemented and conventional techniques regarding the normalized energy for rounds from 0 to 2000. According to Table 1, the implemented technique provides, in general, a better presentation when compared with the traditional methods.\nParameter evaluationThe parameter evaluation for the network lifetime by varying the factors of the ABC is obtained from Figure 11. From Figure 11, it is known that limit 5 is 15.3% better than limit 3 and 17.3% better than limit 1. Thus, the lifetime of the network regarding colony size for varying limit size is verified. Similarly, from Figure 12, normalized network energy by varying parameters of the ABC is verified. From Figure 12, limit 5 is 27.2% superior to limit 1 and 50% superior to limit 3. Thus, the capability of the proposed method is verified.Similarly, from Table 1, for limit 1, the alive node for the 600th iteration is 2% better than those for the 200th and 400th iterations.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSimilarly, the alive node for the 1000th iteration is 18% lesser than those for the 200th, 400th, and 600th iterations. Also, the normalized network energy for limit 2 in the 0th iteration is 12.6% better than that for the 200th iteration and so on. Similarly, from Table 4, the alive node for limit 1 in the 0th and 100th iteration is 1% better than those for the 200th, 400th, and 600th iterations. Similarly, the alive node for the 1000th iteration is 18% lesser than those for the 200th, 400th, and 600th iterations. Also, the normalized network energy for limit 1 in the 400th iteration is 20% better than that for the 600th iteration and so on.

Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nArtificial intelligenceenhanced decision support for informing global sustainable development: a humancentric AI-thinking approach\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLHow\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSMCheah\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYJChan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tACKhor\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEMSay\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInformation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t39\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWater environment management and performance evaluation in Central China: a research-based on comprehensive evaluation system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWYang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXShen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGYuan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWater\n\t\t\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t2472\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tQuantitative analysis of the ecological security pattern for regional sustainable development: case study of Chaohu Basin in eastern China\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWXiao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYZhao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHDa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLv\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

These traditionally established technical approaches for water management and sustainable practice often reflect standard water governance (How et al., 2020). The Sustainability Index (SI) analyses the efficiency of different water policies and the environment and the system's capacity to reduce its vulnerability using artificial intelligent techniques (Prabakaran et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019). The index shows that the system has a higher adaptive capacity for a suggested policy that makes the system more ecological effective (Goralski and Tan, 2020). The sustainability index integrates performance standards that capture the basin's important and long-awaited sustainabilities (Cernev and Fenner, 2020) for environment management using AI (Zhang et al., 2019). The index allows it more comfortable to compare policies as the performance criteria for effective environmental planning and management (Qian et al., 2019;Sachs et al., 2019).

To decrease the time cost in manual work, text classification techniques are applied to automatically identify severity of bug reports. In this paper, we address the problem of low-quality and class imbalance for identifying the severity of bug reports. First, we combine feature selection with instance selection to simultaneously reduce the bug report dimension and the word dimension, which could get small-scale and high-quality reduced data set. Then, an improve random oversampling technique, named, RSMOTE, which is presented to weaken the imbalancedness degree of class distribution. Finally, to avoid the random over-sampling uncertainty of RSMOTE, we develop an ensemble learning algorithm, which is based on Choquet fuzzy integral, to combine multiple RSMOTE. We empirically investigate the performance of data reduction on ten data sets of three large open source projects, namely, Eclipse, Mozilla, and GNOME. The results show that our approach can effectively reduce the data scale and improve the performance of identifying the severity of bug reports. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n61672122\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t61602077\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t61771087\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20170005\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20170540097\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3132016348\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3132018194\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tACAIM20180001\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDiscernibility matrix simplification with new attribute dependency functions for incomplete information systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGLang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLGuo\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tKnowl.

In this work, we present a cost-effective route to synthesize the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite by using cheap metal hydrides and aluminum chloride as starting reagents and to achieve liquid state reactive milling. The LiH/AlCl3 and MgH2/AlCl3 reaction systems were systemically explored. The phase identification of the obtained products was carried out by XRD and the morphology observed by TEM characterization. It was found that the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite can be successfully synthesized by reactive milling of commercial AlCl3 and LiH in a neutral ionic liquid ([2-Eim] OAc). Based on XRD analysis and TEM observation, an average grain size of 56 nm can be obtained by the proposed mechanochemical process. By setting the isothermal dehydrogenation temperature between 80 and 160 \u00b0C, the as-synthesized \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite exhibits an advantage in hydrogen desorption capacity and has fast dehydriding kinetics. The hydrogen desorption content of 9.93 wt% was achieved at 160 \u00b0C, which indicates the potential utilization of the prepared nanocomposite in hydrogen storage applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRChen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCLDuan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLiu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

Based on the drawbacks of above-mentioned wet chemical techniques, Brinks et al. have employed a mechanochemical method to synthesize AlH 3 . 14 It has been demonstrated that the AlH 3 /LiCl composite can be synthesized by a mechanically assisted reaction, between LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 at room temperature and 77 K. 14 The reaction can be described by Eqn.

In present work, a convenient and cost-efficient solid-state mechanochemical reaction is proposed to obtain \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite. With the addition of TiF3, \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite was formed in a short period by milling of LiH and AlCl3. Based on XRD and NMR results, the average grain size of the \u03b1-AlH3 in the nano-composite was 45\u2009nm. The reaction pathway as well as the synergistic effect of TiF3 on the solid state reaction between LiH and AlCl3 were confirmed. In the \u03b1-AlH3/LiCl nano-composite, TiF3 reduced the temperature of dehydriding reaction and improved dehydrogenation rate of \u03b1-AlH3. Within the temperature range between 80 and 160\u2009\u00b0C, dehydrogenation of the as-milled \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite showed fast kinetics. At 160\u2009\u00b0C, a maximum hydrogen desorption of 9.92\u2009wt% was obtained within 750\u2009s, very close to the theoretical hydrogen capacity of \u03b1-AlH3. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nConcise chemistry modulation of the SMM behavior within a family of mononuclear Dy (III) complexes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXMa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWYuan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInorg.

Using this approach, patients with myocardial infarction can be differentiated from those with unstable angina. The present study aims to develop an integrated model, based on the feature selection and classification, for the automatic classification of ACS.\nMethods: A dataset containing medical records of 809 patients suspected to suffer from ACS was used. For each subject, 266 clinical factors were collected. At first, a feature selection was performed based on interviews with 20 cardiologists; thereby 40 seminal features for classifying ACS were selected. Next, a feature selection algorithm was also applied to detect a subset of the features with the best classification accuracy. As a result, the feature numbers considerably reduced to only seven. Lastly, based on the seven selected features, eight various common pattern recognition tools for classification of ACS were used.\nResults: The performance of the aforementioned classifiers was compared based on their accuracy computed from their confusion matrices. Among these methods, the multi-layer perceptron showed the best performance with the 83.2% accuracy.\nConclusion: The results reveal that an integrated AI-based feature selection and classification approach is an effective method for the early and accurate classification of ACS and ultimately a timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPattern analysis for machine olfaction: a review\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRGutierrez-Osuna\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSensors Journal\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2002\n\t\t\n\t\n\tIEEE\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tANFIS: adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJsrJang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern\n\t\t\n\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1993\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPredicting corporate financial distress based on integration of decision tree classification and logistic regression\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMYChen\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tExpert Syst Appl\n\t\t\n\t\t\t38\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tClassification and regression trees\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLBreiman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1984\n\t\t\tChapman & Hall\n\t\t\tLondon\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tReusable components in decision tree induction algorithms\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSuknovic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBDelibasic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJovanovic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVukicevic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDBecejski-Vujaklija\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZObradovic\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComput Stat\n\t\t\n\t\t\t27\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2012\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA logical sequence of questions) extracted from the training data [9,21]. A new case can be classified by starting at the root of the tree and moving through it until a leaf is encountered. Decision trees have become one of the most widely applied methods among numerous classification approaches, because these are white box models with easy-to-interpret results. In addition, its construction does not need any domain knowledge or parameter setting and thus is appropriate for exploratory knowledge discovery [22,23]. ID3 is one of the major algorithms of decision tree which was used in this study.\nBagging-ID3Bagging (Bootstrap aggregating) is a popular approach proposed by Bremen [24,25] which is considered as an ensemble meta-algorithm to build classification models. This resampling-based technique can be incorporated into various classification algorithms or regression methods. This incorporation resulted in reducing the variance associated with the prediction models, and thereby improves the predictive performance of these models. Bagging consists of creating numerous bootstrap replicates of the learning set by drawing \"B\" simple random samples with replacement (bootstrap samples) from the learning set and using these as new learning sets.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nApplication of pattern recognition tools for classifying acute coronary syndrome: an integrated medical modeling\n\t\t\n\t\t\tR ;Kohavi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSalari\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1186/1742-4682-10-57\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInternational joint Conference on artificial intelligence\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t57\n\t\t\t1995. 2013\n\t\t\tMontreal, Quebec, Canada\n\t\t\n\t\n\tTheoretical Biology and Medical Modelling\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This study aims to determine the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult through a meta-analysis approach.\nMethods: The present meta-analysis was conducted between January 2000-August 2019. Articles related to the subject matter were obtained by searching Scopus, Sciencedirect, SID, magiran, Barakat Knowledge Network System, Medline (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases. The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using I2 index and the data were analyzed in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.\nResults: In a study of 3948 individuals aged 50-90 years, the overall prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult was 8.2% (95% CI, 4.14-6.3%) based on meta-analysis. Also, in order to investigate the effects of potential factors (sample size and year of study) on the heterogeneity of severe depression in Iranian older adult, meta-regression was used. It was reported that the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult decreased with increasing sample size and increasing years of the study, which is significantly different (P < 0.05).\nConclusion: Considering the high prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult, it is necessary for health policy makers to take effective control measures and periodic care for the older adult. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nStatistical analysisData were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA version 3), the heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I 2 test and probability of publication bias Funnel chart using Egger test and significance level 0.05 and also to investigate the effects of potential factors on heterogeneity of studies from Meta-regression test.\nResultsBased on investigations on the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult, including articles published in domestic and foreign journals and searches in Magiran, SID, Barakat Knowledge Network System databases, Medline, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google scholar, PRISMA 2009 was used to show the reviewing process (Fig. 1).

This association is so conspicuous in the case of bees that other groups of potential pollinators, especially flies, have long been underestimated. However, visitors are not always pollinators. While the importance of flies in plant-visitor networks is now acknowledged, their pollination effectiveness has hardly been investigated. In this study, we assessed the pollination effectiveness of Geranium sylvaticum flower-visitors using single-visit seed set experiments, in a subalpine meadow where flies are predominant. We found that: (i) empidine dance flies were the most frequent visitors of G. sylvaticum; (ii) a single-visit by an empidine dance fly produced the same average number of seeds as a visit by a bee; (iii) large pollinators were more efficient than small pollinators irrespective of their identity. As a conclusion, large empidines were the main pollinators of G. sylvaticum. Considering the high diversity and abundance of flower-visiting fly species, such results showing their ability to be as effective pollinators as bees should encourage further studies to develop a better understanding on their role in plant-pollinator networks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThey are obligate floral-visitors with more than 2000 described species worldwide which, contrary to the commonly accepted assumptions that they are generalists and poor pollinators, could reveal high levels of specialization and the same pollination efficiency as bees. Their high abundance and diversity throughout the favourable season suggest that they are important pollinators in mountains and at high latitudes [14]. Like empidine dance flies, numerous species of calliphorids, conopids, muscids, anthomyids, tabanids and many other fly families depend on nectar and pollen for feeding.In habitats where bees are unable to thrive, flies often represent the predominant biotic vector carrying pollen grains from one flower to another, and therefore the main potential pollinators.

Lett.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nUntil recently, most of the studies addressing the role of insects as pollinators focused on bees, but the awareness of the collapse of their populations has sparked a growing interest in other flower-visiting insects (non-bee Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera) as potential pollinators [3]. However even in agricultural landscapes, where wild insects have proven efficient pollinators by increasing fruit set independently of honeybees' abundance [4], studies measuring pollination effectiveness of non-bee flower-visiting insects are very scarce. Consequently, despite the proliferating new knowledge on flower-visitor networks, the actual role played by most anthophilous insects in the pollination of flowering plants remains largely unknown.Flies (Diptera) represent the most conspicuous group of flower-visitors and potential pollinators after bees [5][6][7], especially in cool to cold habitats of high altitude or latitude where wild bees become naturally scarcer [8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. However, most studies including dipterans address only flower visitation frequencies, which King et al. [15] consider a poor proxy for pollinator effectiveness.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWild pollinators enhance fruit set of crops regardless of honey bee abundance\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLAGaribaldi\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1126/science.1230200\n\t\n\t\n\t\tScience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t339\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFlies and flowers: taxonomic diversity of anthophiles and pollinators\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBmhLarson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPGKevan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDWInouye\n\t\t\n\t\t10.4039/Ent133439-4\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCan.

Females may compensate for their loss of male fitness by reallocating resources from male function (pollen production and pollinator attraction) to female function (seeds and fruits), thus increasing seed production. Females may also benefit from their inability to self-fertilize if selfing and inbreeding depression reduce seed quality in hermaphrodites. We investigated how differences in floral resource allocation (flower size) between female and hermaphroditic plants affect two measures of female reproductive success, pollinator visitation and pollen receipt, in gynodioecious populations of Geranium richardsonii in Colorado. Using emasculation treatments in natural populations, we further examined whether selfing by autogamy and geitonogamy comprises a significant proportion of pollen receipt by hermaphrodites. Flowers of female plants are significantly smaller than those of hermaphrodites. The reduction in allocation to pollinator-attracting structures (petals) is correlated with a significant reduction in pollinator visitation to female flowers in artificial arrays. The reduction in attractiveness is further manifested in significantly less pollen being deposited on the stigmas of female flowers in natural populations. Autogamy is rare in these protandrous flowers, and geitonogamy accounts for most of the difference in pollen receipt between hermaphrodites and females. Female success at receiving pollen was negatively frequency dependent on the relative frequency of females in populations. Thus, two of the prerequisites for the maintenance of females in gynodioecious populations, differences in resource allocation between floral morphs and high selfing rates in hermaphrodites, occur in G. richardsonii. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch protandry suggests that avoidance of selfing has been a strong selection pressure in the evolution of G. richarsonii's floral biology and mating system. Selfing can depress fitness in both self-compatible and self-incompatible species due to inbreeding depression and interference between self-and outcross pollen, respectively (reviewed by de Jong et al., 1993;Snow et al., 1996). Kearns (1990) inferred that G. richardsonii was self-incompatible or required a minimum threshold quantity of pollen for successful self-fertilization based on a limited number of hand crosses. Recent hand pollination experiments (K. O'Malley, C. Williams, and M. Kuchenreuther, unpublished data) have shown that G. richardsonii does self and suffers inbreeding depression in fruit and seed set.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAgren and Willson (1991) estimated that the selfing rates in two populations of Geranium maculatum were 60 and 73%, based on inbreeding depression. Similarly high selfing rates have been found in hermaphrodites of other gynodioecious species (23-25% in Limnanthes douglasii- Kesseli and Jain, 1984;11-76% in Bidens-Sun and Ganders, 1986;18-61% in Salvia pratensis, Van Treuren et al., 1993;88-100% in Chionographis japonica-Maki, 1993;. 73% in Cucurbita foetidissima- Kohn and Biardi, 1995;68% in Schiedea adamantis-Sakai et al., 1997).A puzzling result of the pollination experiments were the sometimes smaller estimates of pollen receipt on stigmas of unemasculated flowers than on emasculated flowers on unemasculated plants (U vs. E in autogamy experiment; C vs. U in geitonogamy experiment).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nRRSokal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFJRohlf\n\t\t\n\t\tBiometry\n\t\tNew York, New York, USA\n\t\t\n\t\t\tW.

However, identifying epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs and characterizing their functional mechanisms in different cancer subtypes are still major challenges for cancer studies. In this study, we systematically analyzed the epigenetic alterations of lncRNAs at important regulatory elements in three breast cancer subtypes. We identified 87, 691, and 1,197 epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs in luminal, basal, and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, respectively. The landscape of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements revealed that epigenetic changes of the majority of lncRNAs occurred in a subtype-specific manner and contributed to subtype-specific biological functions. We identified six acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27ac)-dysregulated lncRNAs and three DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs (CTC-303L1.2, RP11-738B7.1, and SLC26A4-AS1) as prognostic biomarkers of basal subtype. These lncRNAs were involved in immune response-related biological functions. Treatment of the basal breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 with CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors downregulated H3K27 acetylation levels and caused a decrease in the expression of five H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs (LINC00393, KB-1836B5.1, RP1-140K8.5, AC005162.1, and AC020916.2) and inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells. One epigenetically dysregulated lncRNA (LINC01983) and four lncRNA regulators (UCA1, RP11-221J22.2, RP11-221J22.1, and RP1-212P9.3) were identified as prognostic biomarkers of the luminal molecular subtype of breast cancer by controlling the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation, and T cell migration. Finally, our results highlighted a profound role of enhancer-related H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs, DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs, and lncRNA regulators in breast cancer subtype carcinogenesis and their potential prognostic value. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS2A). These results suggest that lncRNAs with complex splicing patterns are more likely regulated by aberrant epigenetic modifications.In addition, we compared the expression level and expression variation of epi-lncRNAs with other lncRNAs to characterize the expression pattern of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess expression variation of genes among patients with breast cancer. lncRNAs showed substantially lower expression levels than did PCGs in all three breast cancer subtypes, which has been described in previous studies. 17 Interestingly, epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs displayed substantially higher expression levels and lower expression variation compared with other lncRNAs in all three breast cancer subtypes (p < 0.05). Consistently, we observed higher expression levels and lower expression variation of epigenetically dysregulated PCGs compared with other PCGs in the basal and claudin-low subtypes (p < 0.05; Figure S2B). These results suggest that epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs are stably expressed in breast cancer subtypes and may be suitable as potential biomarkers for breast cancer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDe novo identification of differentially methylated regions in the human genome\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTJPeters\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJBuckley\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tALStatham\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRPidsley\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKSamaras\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRLord\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSJClark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPLMolloy\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEpigenetics Chromatin\n\t\t\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tChromatin signature reveals over a thousand highly conserved large non-coding RNAs in mammals\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGuttman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIAmit\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGarber\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCFrench\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMFLin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDFeldser\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMHuarte\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOZuk\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBWCarey\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPCassady\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t458\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2009\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDOSE: an R/Bioconductor package for disease ontology semantic and enrichment analysis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGYu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLGWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGRYan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQYHe\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBioinformatics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t31\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTable 1 .1The information of epi-lncRNAs associated with survival in breast cancer subtypesSubtype lncRNA name Alteration of epigeneticsRegulatory elements Epigenetic alteration Expression Multiple Cox HR model(p) Log-rank test(FDR)BasalLINC00393H3K27ac, H3K4me1enhancerupUp7.61 \u00c2 10 -33.87 \u00c2 10 -2BasalKB-1836B5.1H3K27ac, H3K4me1enhancerupUp1.86 \u00c2 10 -33.87 \u00c2 10 -2BasalCASC11H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 enhancerupUp7.50 \u00c2 10 -34.15 \u00c2 10 -2BasalRP1-140K8.5H3K27ac, H3K4me1enhancerupUp3.74 \u00c2 10 -23.87 \u00c2 10 -2BasalAC005162.1H3K27ac, H3K4me1enhancerupUp1.80 \u00c2 10 -23.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The first targeted therapy, sorafenib, prolonged the overall survival by months. However, resistance often occurs, largely limits its efficacy. Sorafenib was found to target the electron transport chain complexes, which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain sorafenib resistance and further facilitate tumor progression, cancer cells develop strategies to overcome excessive ROS production and obtain resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we investigated the roles of ROS in sorafenib resistance, and found suppressed ROS levels and reductive redox states in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells maintained greater functional and morphological integrity under the treatment of sorafenib. However, cellular oxygen consumption rate and mitochondria DNA content analyses revealed fewer numbers of mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells. Further investigation attributed this finding to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, likely caused by the accelerated degradation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC1\u03b2). Mechanistic dissection showed that upregulated UBQLN1 induced PGC1\u03b2 degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner to attenuate mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS production in sorafenib-resistant cells under sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, clinical investigations further indicated that the patients with higher UBQLN1 levels experienced worse recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, we propose a novel mechanism involving mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS homeostasis in sorafenib resistance, which may offer new therapeutic targets and strategies for HCC patients. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMoreover, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was lower in resistant cells than in parental cells (Fig. 2f), indicating a reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity, likely as a result of the reduced mitochondrial number in resistant cells.The antioxidant system in most drug-resistant cancer cells is complicated. 29 Sorafenib, as a multi-kinase inhibitor, may regulate redox homeostasis in drug-resistant cancer cells. Thus, we monitored the redox balance between biological redox couples, such as GSH/GSSG, NADPH/NADP, and NAD/NADH in parental and resistant cells. In general, compared with parental cell lines, a relative reductive state was found in resistant cell lines (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, NADH/NAD+ in HepG2 cells and NADPH/NADP+ in SK-Hep-1 cells showed inconsistent trends, indicating a general reductive but cell line-specific redox homeostasis in sorafenib resistance.Taken together, these results indicate that resistant cells retain better mitochondrial function and integrity with less mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity, resulting in reduced ROS production in response to sorafenib treatment and sustained sorafenib resistance.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAccelerated PGC1\u03b2 degradation inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation in sorafenib-resistant cells Cells have developed finely tuned and complex mechanisms to adapt to stress conditions and metabolic demand alterations by modulating mitochondrial number and function. 30 Mitochondria and cellular homeostasis are accurately coordinated by mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the reduced mitochondrial content in resistant cells, we first evaluated mitochondria degradation. Mitophagy is a principle mechanism for mitochondria degradation and reduction of ROS stress. 31 We measured mitophagy levels in parental and resistant cells, and found that LC3II (reflects autophagic activity) levels were lower in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, with or without chloroquine (a classic inhibitor of autophagy that alters the acidic environment of lysosomes thus blocks the binding of autophagosomes to lysosomes; Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, levels of the mitophagy-specific markers PARKIN and PINK were also reduced in resistant cells (Fig. 3c,d). Fluorescence imaging further revealed a lower autophagic flux in resistant cells than parental cells under sorafenib treatment (Fig. 3e).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3e). These results indicated that mitophagy was decreased in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, which is unlikely to explain the lower mitochondrial content in resistant cells.We next examined mitochondrial biogenesis in the pairs of HCC cell lines. The PGC1 family of transcriptional coactivators act as master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, with PGC1\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b2 regulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) to maintain mtDNA levels and mitochondrial function. 32 Thus, we first evaluated PGC1\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b2 protein levels, and found that PGC1\u03b2 expression was reduced in the resistant cell lines, while little change was observed with PGC1\u03b1 expression (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of TFAM were also decreased in resistant cells compared with those in parental cells (Fig. 3g), and overexpressing PGC1\u03b2 in resistant cells increased TFAM mRNA levels (Fig. 3h) and ROS production in response to sorafenib (Fig. 3i,j).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion-anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep-charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion-anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof-of-concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium-based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 , and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCarbon Very Important\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKey-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Natural Science Foundation of China\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tunknown\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShenzhen Science and Technology Planning Project\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGuangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 8, 2021\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKaiYang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDrQirongRLiu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDrYongpingPZheng\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHangYin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShanqingZhang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ts.zhang@griffith.edu.au\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttangyb@siat.ac.cn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0000-0003-2705-4618\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProf. Y]H BYin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProfY BTang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProf. SQZhang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProf. YBTang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProf.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIAKinloch\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJSuhr\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJLou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRJYoung\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPMAjayan\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1126/science.aat7439\n\t\n\t\n\t\tScience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t362\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPLu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYSun\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHXiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYYu\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/aenm.201702434\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAdv.

However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety. However, the poor processibility and relatively low ionic conductivity of Na+ and K+ ions limit the further practical applications of ISEs. PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na+ /K+ ion transfer is summarized. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/KIBs based on PEs are presented. Finally, some suggestions and perspectives are put forward to provide some possible directions for the follow-up researches. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[93] For example, Li + ions first locate at the active site provided by the polar group of PEs (e.g., \ue0c6O\ue0c6 in PEO). Under the driving of the electric field, the local segmental motion of polymer chains induces Li + ions to move/leap from one coordination site to another adjacent active site, and thus realizes ion migration. [62] It is theoretically reasonable to infer that the migration of Na + /K + ions in PEs shares a similar mechanism with that of Li + ions, since Na + /K + ions have similar electrochemical activity with Li + ions. However, it is noteworthy that the migration process of different active ions in PEs is not only associated with the type of active ions (ionic radius, charge density, etc.) and inactive ions (bonds with polymer matrix), but also involves the dielectric constant, amorphous phase characteristics, mobility of the polymer matrix, etc. [91] Figure 4 summarizes the merits and deficiencies of several typical PE matrices.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[91] Furthermore, iv) PEs take advantage of good interfacial contact and electrochemical compatibility over ISEs because the natural rigidity of the latter generally results in the presence of interfacial gaps and resultantly poor interfacial contact between electrolyte and electrodes. v) PEs are more conducive to realizing high ionic conductivity for the transfer of Na + ions and K + ions at room temperature or even at low temperature than ISEs, due to the large ionic radii of active ions and different ion migration mechanism between PEs and ISEs. [92] vi) PEs also have some other merits of lightweight, high-volume utilization, and good film-forming ability. [90] To further improve the electrochemical properties of PEs, it is of significance to get fundamental insight into the migration mechanism and transfer kinetics of active ions in PEs. It is generally accepted that the Li + -ion migration in PEs is affected by the fracture/formation of coordination bonds in the segmented movement of polymer chains, which mainly occurs in the amorphous region of the polymer matrices.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSee the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\t\t\twww.advancedsciencenews.com\u00a9 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAcknowledgements H.Y. and C.J.H. contributed equally to this work.

(Poaceae) based on retrotransposon-based markers \nStatement: Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) have all been used to measure genetic variation and relationships in cultivars and landraces in recent years [citation].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Morphometric and ISSR-Analysis of Local Populations of Geranium molle L. from the Southern Coast of the Caspian Sea \nAbstract: Geranium molle is known as Dovefoot Geranium or Awnless Geranium. Dovefoot Geranium is a low-growing herb with pink flowers and sharply toothed leaves. Dovefoot Geranium is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to many habitats of the world. This species is very similar to G. robertianum but its palmate-like leaves and bilobed petals show differences. This plant is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. We have no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Therefore, due to the importance of these plant species, we performed a combination of morphological and molecular data for this species. For this study, we used 132 randomly collected plants from 18 geographical populations in 4 provinces. Genetic diversity parameters were determined in these populations. STRUCTURE analysis and K-Means clustering identified 14 gene pools in the country and revealed isolation by distance among the studied populations. The Mantel test showed correlation between genetic and geographical distance. AMOVA revealed a significant genetic difference among populations and showed that 40% of total genetic variation was due to within-population diversity. The consensus tree of both molecular and morphological data identified divergent populations. These data may be used in future breeding and conservation of this important medicinal plant in the country. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBut it is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. It has minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and fibre.Molecular markers are useful in identifying the maximally diverse parental genotypes through an evaluation of genetic diversity which is useful in cultivar identification and breeding. Among the various molecular markers, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) are simple and quick techniques and have become popular as their application does not need any prior information about the target sequences in the genome, high-efficiency and sharp sensibility, and these techniques have now been widely used for line identification and genetic diversity. These markers have been used in DNA fingerprinting, conservation biology, identification and determination of species relationships in many plants [16,17]. G. molle grows in different regions of Iran and comprises many local geographical populations. Therefore, the present study was performed for the first time in the country to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of these local populations. The results of present study may have positive effect on conservation strategy and future breeding of this medicinally important plant.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe amplifications, reactions were performed in Techne thermocycler (Germany) with the following program: 5 min initial denaturation step 94\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C; 1 min at 52-57\u00b0C and 2 min at 72\u00b0C. The reaction was completed by final extension step of 7-10 min at 72\u00b0C. The amplification products were observed by running on 1% agarose gel, followed by the ethidium bromide staining.The fragment size was estimated by using a 100 bp molecular size ladder (Fermentas, Germany).\nDATA ANALYSES\nMorphological StudiesMorphological characters were first standardized (Mean = 0, Variance = 1) and used to establish Euclidean distance among pairs of taxa [23]. For grouping of the plant specimens, the UPGMA (Unweighted paired group using average) and Ward (Minimum spherical characters) as well as ordination methods of MDS (Multidimensional scaling) and PCoA (Principal coordinate analysis) were used [23].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nANOVA (Analysis of variance) were performed to show morphological difference among the populations while, PCA (Principal components analysis) biplot was used to identify the most variable morphological characters among the studied populations [23].

Nei's genetic distance among populations was used for Neighbor Joining (NJ) clustering and Neighbor-Net networking [26,27]. The Mantel test was performe as implemented in PAST ver. 2.17 [23,24]. For this, Nei genetic distance was determined for ISSR data, while Geographic distance of PAST was determined for geographical data.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated. 24 Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\nPaperFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis. 20,25 \nDe novo assembly and gene predictionsOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n20 However, the effects of JP on CRC mechanisms remain unclear. At present, next-generation sequencing platforms provide opportunities to explore taxonomic, protein-coding gene or protein expression diversities, by applying more comprehensive and less biased measurements to the diet, microbiota and the host. 24,50 The approach has provided new information on the diversity and composition of human gut microbiota. The influence of plant polysaccharides on bacterial growth and metabolism depends on polysaccharide structure, the dose assayed and the microorganism strain. 13 Recent findings have suggested a variety of potential mechanisms for plant polysaccharides acting on bacteria. For example, plant polysaccharides and/or oligosaccharide could bind to bacterial cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner, thus disturbing membrane function and inhibiting cell growth. 2,22,37 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial membrane. 23,36 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial\nPaperFood & Function membrane.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPredicted ORFs \u2265 300 bp in length from all samples were pooled and combined based on \u226595% identity and 90% read coverage using CD-HIT to reduce the number of redundant genes for downstream assembly. The reads were re-arrayed to predict genes using BWA to count reads numbers. Finally, gene catalogues were obtained from non-redundant genes with gene reads counts >2. 30,31\nTaxonomical assignment and functional classificationAfter read filtering, clean reads were used to generate taxonomic profiles using a k-Mer-based taxonomic classifier. This approach employs a novel data structure called l-Othello, which supports efficient querying of taxonomic information from NCBI, using reads k-Mer signatures of 31 bp in length. All unique ORFs were annotated using DIAMOND to the functional databases: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). 31 \nStatistical analysisThe results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM where applicable. GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significances for group differences were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Duncan's test.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many conventional computational methods for identifying N6-methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m6A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m6A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m6A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m6A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, an online prediction web server implementing the four proposed predictors has been built and is available at http://server.malab.cn/Gene2vec/. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nProtDet-CCH: protein remote homology detection by combining long short-term memory and ranking methods\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSLi\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1109/TCBB.2018.2789880\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPse-in-One: a web server for generating various modes of pseudo components of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJChen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLFang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKCChou\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1093/nar/gkv458\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNucleic Acids Res\n\t\t\n\t\t\t43\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tiRSpot-EL: identify recombination spots with an ensemble learning approach\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRLong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKCChou\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1093/bioinformatics/btw539\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBioinformatics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA compendium of RNA-binding motifs for decoding gene regulation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDRay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHKazan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKBCook\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMTWeirauch\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHSNajafabadi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSGueroussov\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMAlbu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHZheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAYang\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/nature12311\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t499\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHigh-resolution mapping reveals a conserved, widespread, dynamic mRNA methylation program in yeast meiosis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSSchwartz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSDAgarwala\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMRMumbach\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJovanovic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPMertins\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAShishkin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYTabach\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTSMikkelsen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSatija\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGRuvkun\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.047\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t155\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIDP-CRF: intrinsically disordered protein/ region identification based on conditional random fields\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t10.3390/ijms19092483\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInt J Mol Sci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t19\n\t\t\t2483\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tUnique features of the m 6 A meth-ylome in Arabidopsis thaliana\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGZLuo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAMacqueen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGZheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHDuan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLCDore\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZLu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKChen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGJia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJBergelson\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/ncomms6630\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat Commun\n\t\t\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t5630\n\t\t\t2014\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Some species are of medicinal importance while some are well known weeds. In arid and semi-arid regions, E. cicutarium has had some importance as a forage plant and is an important grazing plant and source of protein supplements to straw for ruminants in semi deserts and wastelands of the Middle East. There is no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Due to the medicinal importance of this species, a genetic variability and populations\u2019 structure study is performed studying 15 geographical populations of E. cicutarium Therefore, we used six inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and 15 combined IRAP markers to reveal within and among population genetic diversity in this plant. AMOVA test produced significant genetic difference (PhiPT = 0.39, P = 0.010) among the studied populations and also revealed that, 55% of total genetic variability was due to within population diversity while, 45% was due to among population genetic differentiation. Mantel test showed positive significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance of the studied populations. Networking, STRUCTURE analyses and population assignment test revealed some degree of gene flow among these populations. PCoA plot of populations based on morphological characters was in agreement with MDS plot of molecular data. These results indicated that geographical populations of E. cicutarium are well differentiated both in genetic content as well as morphological characteristics. Consensus tree based on morphological and genetic data separated some of these populations from the others suggesting the existence of ecotypes within this species. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1998;GEORGE et al. 2006); and is an important grazing plant and source of protein supplements to straw for ruminants in semi deserts and wastelands of the Middle East (AL-MASRI, 2007).

The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated. 24 Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\nPaperFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis. 20,25 \nDe novo assembly and gene predictionsOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n20 However, the effects of JP on CRC mechanisms remain unclear. At present, next-generation sequencing platforms provide opportunities to explore taxonomic, protein-coding gene or protein expression diversities, by applying more comprehensive and less biased measurements to the diet, microbiota and the host. 24,50 The approach has provided new information on the diversity and composition of human gut microbiota. The influence of plant polysaccharides on bacterial growth and metabolism depends on polysaccharide structure, the dose assayed and the microorganism strain. 13 Recent findings have suggested a variety of potential mechanisms for plant polysaccharides acting on bacteria. For example, plant polysaccharides and/or oligosaccharide could bind to bacterial cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner, thus disturbing membrane function and inhibiting cell growth. 2,22,37 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial membrane. 23,36 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial\nPaperFood & Function membrane.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPredicted ORFs \u2265 300 bp in length from all samples were pooled and combined based on \u226595% identity and 90% read coverage using CD-HIT to reduce the number of redundant genes for downstream assembly. The reads were re-arrayed to predict genes using BWA to count reads numbers. Finally, gene catalogues were obtained from non-redundant genes with gene reads counts >2. 30,31\nTaxonomical assignment and functional classificationAfter read filtering, clean reads were used to generate taxonomic profiles using a k-Mer-based taxonomic classifier. This approach employs a novel data structure called l-Othello, which supports efficient querying of taxonomic information from NCBI, using reads k-Mer signatures of 31 bp in length. All unique ORFs were annotated using DIAMOND to the functional databases: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). 31 \nStatistical analysisThe results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM where applicable.

The phase, photocatalytic hydrogen production, microstructure, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the fabricated photocatalysts were investigated. BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst has a larger ability for the hydrogen production in photocatalysis process than that of BiFeO3. The reason of the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst was revealed by the measurements of UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photocurrent curves and electrochemical impedance spectra. Moreover, the magnetic properties of BiFeO3 and BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalysts were also investigated to show the easy separation. These results in current work indicate that BiFeO3:Gd3+ is an excellent photocatalyst and has potential applications in photocatalytic hydrogen production. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nExcept for TiO 2 , various types of photocatalysts were reported in these years, such as titanate [7,8], AM 2 O 4 (A = Cu and Zn, M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co) [9,10], tantalite (niobate) [11,12], sulphide [13,14], ferrite [15,16] and some oxide semiconductor [17][18][19][20][21][22]. BiFeO 3 is a perovskite-type multiferroic compound, which shows potential applications in spintronics devices due to its high ferroelectric and magnetic phase transitions, as well as large remanent polarization at room temperature [23][24][25]. Moreover, it shows excellently photovoltaic effect and photocatalytic activity because that it can absorb a wide range of sunlight corresponding to its small E g [26][27][28]. For the applications in the photocatalyst field, one of advantages of BiFeO 3 is its excellently magnetic property.

Herein, a simple and versatile method for preparing various HP-MOFs at room temperature was demonstrated, which had introduced surfactant as the template, whereas zinc oxide (ZnO) has been used as an accelerant. The resulting HP-MOFs showed multimodal hierarchical porous structures and excellent thermal stability. More importantly, the synthesis time was reduced dramatically to 11 min, with a maximal HP-MOFs STY of as high as 2575 kg m\u22123 d\u22121. Furthermore, the rapid formation process of HP-MOFs was examined through quantum chemistry calculation, and a feasible synthesis mechanism was also proposed. Notably, our synthesis strategy had shown a versatility, since other surfactants could also be used as the templates for the rapid room-temperature fabrication of diverse stable HP-MOFs. Importantly, the porosity of the HP-MOFs could be readily tuned through controlling the type of template. Moreover, gas adsorption measurement of HP-MOFs revealed high CH4 uptake capacity at 298 K due to the increase in surface area and pore volume. Our findings suggest that such method is applicable for the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of HP-MOFs on an industrial scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSequential functionalization of porous coordination polymer crystals\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKHirai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSFurukawa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMKondo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHUehara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOSakata\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSKitagawa\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/anie.201101924\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAngew Chem Int Edit\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t8057\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGeneralized hightemperature synthesis of zeolite catalysts with unpredictably high space-time yields (STYs)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCBian\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPan\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1039/C6TA09866E\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Mater Chem A\n\t\t\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t2613\n\t\t\t2017\n\nExcerpt 2: \nmetalorganic framework nanospheres with well-ordered mesopores synthesized in an ionic liquid/Co 2 /surfactant system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYZhao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBHan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJSong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQWang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAngew Chem Int Edit\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t636\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA modulator-induced defect-formation strategy to hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks with high stability\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGCai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tH-LJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/anie.201610914\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAngew Chem Int Edit\n\t\t\n\t\t\t56\n\t\t\t563\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA spray-drying strategy for synthesis of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks and their assembly into hollow superstructures\n\t\t\n\t\t\tACarne-Sanchez\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIImaz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMCano-Sarabia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDMaspoch\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/nchem.1569\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat Chem\n\t\t\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t203\n\t\t\t2013\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFacile conversion of hydroxy double salts to metal-organic frameworks using metal oxide particles and atomic layer deposition thinfilm templates\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJZhao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWTNunn\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPCLemaire\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1021/jacs.5b08752\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Am Chem Soc\n\t\t\n\t\t\t137\n\t\t\t13756\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA chemically functionalizable nanoporous material [Cu 3 (TMA) 2 (H2O) 3 ] n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSs-YChui\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSm-FLo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPCharmant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAGOrpen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIDWilliams\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tScience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t283\n\t\t\t1148\n\t\t\t1999\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this paper, the parameter analysis method in signal processing and the meaning and characteristics of each parameter are introduced. Then, the waveform analysis method is introduced and the basic theory of wavelet transform and its spectrum analysis in waveform analysis method are mainly analyzed. The comparison between wavelet transform and Fourier transform is made: traditional Fourier transform signal processing methods can only be used to process transient stationary signals, and the transient non-stationary signals cannot be analyzed locally. The wavelet transform can take into account the characteristics of both the time and frequency domains, and it can also reflect the local signal well. Through the analysis of the signals in the process of concrete damage, it is found that the two signal processing methods mentioned above can well characterize the damage evolution of materials and damage precursors. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nEnhanced hydrogen production performance through controllable redox exsolution within CoFeAlO x spinel oxygen carrier materials\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDZeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYQiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJZeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRXiao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

The concept of a smart city is introduced to improve the quality of city life. Smart cities are being developed to satisfy the need for the safety of its users\u2019 and secure journeys over in the urban scenario by proposing the smart mobility concept. At the same time, Vehicular adhoc network (VANET) comes under the type of mobile adhoc network (MANET), wherever the vehicles are treated as nodes in a network. The application of Big Data technologies to VANET gains useful insight from the massive quantity of operational data to enhance traffic management process like planning, engineering as well as operation. During the real-time processes, the VANET generates large data, and the VANET characteristics are mapped to Big Data attributes. Moreover, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed for routing in vehicular networks over Hadoop Map Reduce standalone distributed framework and over multi-node cluster with 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes. The simulation outcomes ensure that the processing time of the algorithm is significant decreases with a rise in the node count of the Hadoop framework. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nedu.co\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Telematics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Cauca\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tColombia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJUthayakumar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Computer Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPondicherry University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPuducherry\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBS AbdurRahman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrescent Institute of Science and Technology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChennai\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn effect of big data technology with ant colony optimization based routing in vehicular ad hoc networks: Towards smart cities\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12 January 2019\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2C87EE48A6D050FDAA6027063AF3546A\n\t\t\t\t\t10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAn effect of big data technology with ant colony optimization based routing in vehicular ad hoc networks: Towards smart cities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2019\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSKLakshmanaprabu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKShankar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKalasalingam Academy of Research and Education\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKrishnankoil\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSSheeba\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsheebaranis@skcet.ac.in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSri Krishna College of Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoimbatore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnasAbdulhay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tewabdulhay@just.edu.jo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBiomedical Engineering Department\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJordan University of Science and Technology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIrbid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJordan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNArunkumar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSASTRA University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTanjavur\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGustavoRamirez\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgramirez@unicauca.edu.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.115\n\t\t\t\t\tReceived 19 October 2018 Received in revised form 5 December 2018 Accepted 11 January 2019\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVANET Big data Hadoop Ant colony optimization Smart cities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\na b s t r a c t Rapid growth in urban population creates various kinds of issues like long hours traffic-jams, pollution which makes the city life insecure and non-liveable.

The tool pin geometry directly affects the generation of heat and the flow of internal materials during the FSW process. The effects of the FSW tool pin angle on heat generation and internal flow have not been quantitatively investigated in detail. In this manuscript, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was implemented to analyze the effects of pin angle on the thermo-mechanical action during the FSW process of AA5058 Al-Mg alloy. Experimental test results validate the thermal outcomes of the used model. The obtained results revealed that, when the pin angle is increased, the heat generation decreases while the mechanical action of the tool increases. The internal heat distribution at a higher pin angle is symmetrical. The higher mechanical action of the tool decreases the viscosity of the internal materials and increases stirring action (materials flow) around the pin. Furthermore, plastic flow near the tool increased stirring action and formed a larger stir zone in the joint area.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this case, it is necessary to solve Navier-Stokes equations [32][33][34][35]. In this regard's conservation equations for continuity, energy and momentum are used to solve the materials flow.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe simulation procedure was done on the commercially ANSYS FLUENT software under the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The simulation domain dimension and geometry are defined according to the experimental tests, as shown in Figure 1a. A 3D Cartesian system for the welded material (WM) and the FSW tools was established. All geometries and process parameters were selected according to the experimental tests. The origin was set at the middle point of the FSW tool shoulder. The x-axis indicated the welding direction, and the z-axis indicated the FSW tool normal axis. The FSW tool had rotational movement, and the interior domain was set to move according to the welding tool speed. The interior domain had the same velocity as the welding tool by the velocity inlet side. The sidewalls, along with the top and bottom, had the same velocity as the velocity of the inlet. The outer plate of the workpiece was set at zero pressure to avoid the reverse flow at the pressure outlet. The WM is assumed to be a non-Newtonian single-phase fluid representing the quasi-static thermal and fluid flow boundary problem.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFigure 7 .7Figure 7.

One of the main solutions for increasing the available capacity is the predetermined plan for constructing a water circulation system to restore the existing water resources. For this objective, a combination model was conducted based on a stormwater management technique and environment landscape system (ELS) under drought conditions. A hydrological framework was established using the long-term meteorological information in central China to estimate the extreme values of surface water in each stress period. A data analysis system was generated at three meteorological points of the study area and the developed model was incorporated to simulate the behavior of the subsurface flow. Consequently, a growth simulation model was designed according to the soil structure and vegetation canopy cover to formulate a real-time plan for the restoration of ELS. Results showed that the proposed model could improve the water productivity in urban and environment consumptions. Furthermore, technical analysis confirmed the suitability and applicability of the developed plan in cities with water shortages. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n3264541014.94.729746118.23.9334371222.15.932639134.63.443031\nTable 2 |2Initial range of calibrated parametersParameterIndex ValueReferencePermeable areaPA0-2.8Huber &Dickinson (\uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf645)Impervious areaIA0-11.033Huber &Dickinson (\uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf645)Depression storage ofDSP 2.7-5Tsihrintzis andpermeable areaHamid (1998)Depression storage ofDSI 0.2-3.5Huber &impervious areaDickinson (\uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf645)\nTable 3 |3Error indicators for evaluating the calibration and verification resultsStorm numberEFF (%)RMSE (m 3 /s)CRM (m 3 /s)1787.6\u00c00.0452816.90.0313924.3\u00c00.0044836.30.0155943.60.00456777.2\u00c00.0487826.7\u00c00.0358895.10.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPoint of view research papers confirmed the need for a calibration process but the calibration methods were different (Kleidorfer et  \u0394V \u00bc P \u00fe S i \u00fe G i \u00c0 ETa \u00c0 I \u00c0 S 0 \u00c0 G 0 \u00b1 T (1)where \u0394V \u00bc storage capacity variation; P \u00bc precipitation; S i \u00bc surface water infiltration; G i \u00bc surface water infiltration;ETa \u00bc actual evapotranspiration; I \u00bc infiltration; S 0 \u00bc surface water seepage; G 0 \u00bc surface water seepage; T \u00bc tidal current.The surface flow rate will be obtained using the Manning equation.Q \u00bc 1 n AR 2=3 S 1=3 (2)where Infiltration rate (I r ) is one of the main component of the decision system that is formulated as follow:Q \u00bc discharge, n \u00bc Manning roughness coefficient A \u00bc cross-I r \u00bc I s (1 \u00fe C p (SM m \u00c0 SM)=SM m )(3)where I s \u00bc infiltration rate under the saturated condition;C p \u00bc the permeability coefficient; SM m \u00bc soil water capacity;\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese parameters are calculated based on hydraulic, hydrological and hydrogeological information (Mattar & Alamoud \uf645\uf643\uf644\uf64a).

Al-MOF has been extensively characterized using FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, FE-SEM, TG-DTA, and Brunauer \u2013 Emmett \u2013 Teller (BET) techniques. The prepared samples, which included large hexagons and triangular channels, had a pore size of about 20 nm and a surface area of about 1245.2 m2/g, according to the results. The mechanism of the formation of Al-MOF has been proposed based on density functional theory with B3LYP and 6\u201331 G (d,p) as the basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbits (HOMO) to the lowest unusable molecular orbit (LUMO) are also used to discuss chemical reactivity patterns in molecules. Al-MOF has demonstrated anticancer activity against human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines, suggesting that it could be a promising anticancer drug for clinical use. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe particle density of a system with interacting N particles is used as the original value in DFT instead of the wave function [31] . Frontier orbital energy gap is the subtraction of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO). The Frontier orbital energy gap could be used to determine the interaction between different species. Harmonic vibrational waves were calculated using second-order analytical derivatives to confirm the convergence of minimums on the potential surface and to evaluate the zero-vibration contrast energy. As shown in Fig. 2 , in the finitecharge regime at one of the metal/molecule interfaces, the role of non-boundary modes is important, as these channels provide additional channels through which they can be used. An interface can be used to transmit the load [32] . As a result, the VESTA software used HOMO-LUMO to determine the most likely mechanism of Al-MOF formation [33] . Using the Gauss-09 quantum chemistry package, kinetic and thermochemical data were estimated at the theoretical DFT level [34] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDiffusion of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the small-pore titanium bis (phosphonate) metal-organic framework MIL-91 (Ti): a combination of quasielastic neutron scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSPillai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHJobic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMMKoza\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFNouar\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCSerre\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGMaurin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNARamsahye\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChemPhysChem\n\t\t\n\t\t\t18\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOrganometallic Aluminum Fumarate Backbone Material\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCKiener\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUMuller\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSchubert\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2009\n\t\t\n\t\n\tGoogle Patents\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHW BTeo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAChakraborty\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYKitagawa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSKayal\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInt.

Although, professional stock analysts and fund managers usually make subjective judgments, based on objective technical indicators, it is difficult for non-professionals to apply this forecasting technique because there are too many complex technical indicators to be considered. Moreover, two drawbacks have been found in many of the past forecasting models: (1) statistical assumptions about variables are required for time series models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), to produce forecasting models of mathematical equations, and these are not easily understood by stock investors; and (2) the rules mined from some artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as neural networks (NN), are not easily realized.\n\nIn order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model, using multi-technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Further, it includes four proposed procedures in the hybrid model to provide efficient rules for forecasting, which are evolved from the extracted rules with high support value, by using the toolset based on rough sets theory (RST): (1) select the essential technical indicators, which are highly related to the future stock price, from the popular indicators based on a correlation matrix; (2) use the cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA) and minimize the entropy principle approach (MEPA) to partition technical indicator value and daily price fluctuation into linguistic values, based on the characteristics of the data distribution; (3) employ a RST algorithm to extract linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset; and (4) utilize genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to get better forecasting accuracy and stock return. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with two types of performance evaluations, accuracy and stock return, and by using a six-year period of the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) as the experiment dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, RST and GAs). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFrom the model verification, it is shown that the refined processes are effective in improving forecasting accuracy, and, based on the evidence, a stock analyst or investor can employ the refined processes proposed in this paper to improve their forecasting tools or models.The rest of this paper is organized, as follows: Section 2 introduces the related works; Section 3 demonstrates the proposed model and algorithm; Section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed model and describes the findings; and Section 5 draws conclusions and proposes recommendations for future research.\nRelated worksThis section reviews related works of technical analysis, cumulative probability distribution approach, minimize entropy principle approach, rough set theory, and genetic algorithms.\nTechnical analysisTechnical analysis is an attempt to predict future stock price movements by analyzing a past sequence of stock prices [39]. It relies on charts and looks for particular configurations that are supposed to have predictive value. Analysts focus on investor psychology, which represents common investors' responses to certain price formations and price movements, to analyze the fluctuations of stock market. The price at which investors are willing to buy or sell depends on personal expectation. If investors expect the security price to rise, they will buy it; if investors expect the security price to fall, they will sell it.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, RST and GAs).\u00d3 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Although only a few investors profit from the stock market, millions of them still have not given up trying to make money from the market. Therefore, since the first stock market opened, numerous forecasting methods have been employed in an attempt to predict stock prices.In the area of stock market forecasting, the technical analysis method is one of the primary analytic approaches used by investors to make investment decisions, and many researchers have been focusing on technical analysis to increase their investment returns [4,13,15].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nReturn calculation. Each selected experimental dataset is split into two subdatasets: training and testing datasets.The refined rules, extracted by the proposed model from the training dataset, are used for forecasting the testing dataset and calculating stock return, based on the trading strategies, as follows: (i) ''buy on open and sell on close,\" when the selected rule indicates that the forecasted price fluctuation of the next day is ''going up;\" (ii) ''sell on open and buy on close,\" when the selected rule indicates that forecasted price fluctuation of the next day is ''going down;\" and (iii) ''no transaction,\" when the selected rule indicates that the forecasted price fluctuation of the next day is ''staying flat.\" Based on the refined rules and the strategies, the returns for the proposed model can be calculated and summarized.\nEvaluation and comparison.In this procedure, two types of performance evaluations, forecasting accuracy and stock return, are employed. In forecasting accuracy evaluation, RST and GA models, using the same preprocess conditions as with the proposed model, are employed as comparison models. In forecasting accuracy evaluation, the Buy-and-Hold method (defined in Eq.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Compared with the conventional neural network learning algorithm it overcomes the slow training speed and over-fitting problems. ELM is based on empirical risk minimization theory and its learning process needs only a single iteration. The algorithm avoids multiple iterations and local minimization. It has been used in various fields and applications because of better generalization ability, robustness, and controllability and fast learning rate. In this paper, we make a review of ELM latest research progress about the algorithms, theory and applications. It first analyzes the theory and the algorithm ideas of ELM, then tracking describes the latest progress of ELM in recent years, including the model and specific applications of ELM, finally points out the research and development prospects of ELM in the future.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this paper, it is shown that EM-ELMs can also be cast as a particular case of SAOCIF. In particular, EM-ELMs can easily be extended to test some number of random candidates at each step and select the best of them, as SAOCIF does. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the cost of the computation of the optimal output-layer weights in the originally proposed EM-ELMs can be improved if it is replaced by the one included in SAOCIF.In addition, there are still a lot of applications about ELM in other areas. An improved ELM method was proposed for soft sensing modeling by Chang et al. (2007). By adding a kind of sorting neurons into the hidden layer of the single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), a new SLFN structure was proposed. The method provided a new approach to build soft sensing models, and it was successfully applied to the soft sensing modeling the of cell concentration for the Nosiheptied fermentation process to realize the online prediction of the cell concentration. Pan et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe equivalence of a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) to a generalized single hidden layer feedforward network is shown first, which is then used to develop the OS-Fuzzy-ELM algorithm. This results in a FIS that can handle any bounded non-constant piecewise continuous membership function. Furthermore, the learning in OS-Fuzzy-ELM can be done with the input data coming in a one-by-one mode or a chunk-by-chunk mode with fixed or varying chunk size. In OS-Fuzzy-ELM, all the antecedent parameters of membership functions are randomly assigned first, and then, the corresponding consequent parameters are determined analytically. Performance comparisons of OS-Fuzzy-ELM with other existing algorithms are presented using realworld benchmark problems in the areas of nonlinear system identification, regression, and classification.To solve the problem of extreme learning machine (ELM) online training with sequential training samples, a new algorithm called selective forgetting extreme learning machine (SF-ELM) is proposed by Zhang (2011) and applied to chaotic time series prediction.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHow to use the ELM better use to address and resolve any regression and multi-classification problem is worth to explore and discover.Table 11Basic characteristic of the three datasets Datasets Classification Number of samples Number of attributesSegmen72,31019Satimage 74,43536Diabetes 27688\nTable 22Performance comparison of three kinds of algorithmsDatasetsAlgorithmTime/sClassification accuracy/%Hidden layernodes/number ofsupport vectorTrain timeTest timeTrainingTestingaccuracyaccuracySegmenELM1.0070.056897.5895.03100BP2438.50.078194.3683.01200SVM0.26410.386584.0777.92100SatimageELM9.76560.187594.6387.75200BP4786.90.254890.6882.02150SVM1.13840.435184.9380.45500DiabetesELM0.03130.156384.7777.6360BP0.94560.458178.5669.73100SVM0.01790.027565.3658.49300kernel function of SVM choose radial basis function.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It is a process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups, where each group contains objects which are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and different from those of other groups. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data which have anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, bioinformatics, biology, recommendation systems and the clustering of text documents. Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of their convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based globalized search algorithm that uses the principles of the social behavior of swarms. PSO produces better results in complicated and multi-peak problems. This paper presents a literature survey on the PSO algorithm and its variants to clustering high-dimensional data. An attempt is made to provide a guide for the researchers who are working in the area of PSO and high-dimensional data clustering. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTo help professionals to quickly and accurately diagnose any latent heart disease, the proposed systematic approach produced results that were consistent with the manual labels with 99.5% average accuracy. Marini and Walczak (2011) proposed a discrete binary-coded implementation of the PSO algorithm to identify and select variables with a significant clustering tendency. In particular, to cope with the problems that can arise when performing variable selection on data sets with a high number of variables, and to account for the possibility of using the method also for purely exploratory purposes, an unsupervised approach was used, where the fitness was computed based on hierarchical clustering models. The characteristics of the method were shown on two simulated data sets and on a real megavariate data set coming from the analysis of genomic microarrays. They conclude that in all cases, PSO allowed them to explore different subspaces and to discover meaningful structures in the analyzed data. Based on these considerations, it is apparent that the use of PSO can represent a very promising option to deal with the problem of finding groups in a multivariate data set in a relatively straightforward and reliable way.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1 Fig. 212Fig.1The PSO algorithm\nTable 11\nTable 22Resume of the research contributions in different applications domain Application\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank CNPq, FAPEMIG (Brazilian agencies) and NSERC (Canada) for partial financial support.

There are several variants of EA but for the purpose of this work two are identified: a) Genetic Algorithms (GAs) (Holland (1975)), which has been used quite extensively for CF, b) Scatter Search (SS) (Marti et al. (2006)), and c) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (Kennedy and Eberhart (1995)) which has been employed for CF only recently.The core operation for GAs is based on evolution which usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals and happens in generations. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated, multiple individuals are stochastically selected from the current population (based on their fitness), and modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new population. The new population is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMajor objectives are identified as minimisation of intercellular movements, machine/load utilisation and numerous cost considerations such as: machine operating cost, machine modification costs, machine (re)configuration cost, subcontracting cost, machine setup cost, inventory holding cost, replacement costs of defective parts. Also major constraints are described as: part/machine operation sequences, multiple machines of the same type, part/machine utilisation or processing times, alternative process plans and multi-period time horizon when a dynamic CF system is encountered. A number of conclusions can be drawn from Table 2 such as:\u2022 Most of the formulations for CF propose a mathematical programming model with the main objective of minimising the total number of intercellular movements. Other mathematical programming formulations involve cost related objective functions and only a few consider machine/load utilisation as a goal parameter for CF;\u2022 Mathematical programming formulations for CF are hard to implement due to computational limitations for large scale problems.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this problem, the most popular performance measure is the top precision measure, and the most important component of a retrieval system is the similarity function used to compare a query image against a database image. However, up to now, there is no existing similarity learning method proposed to optimize the top precision measure. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel similarity learning method to maximize the top precision measure. We model this problem as a minimization problem with an objective function as the combination of the losses of the relevant images ranked behind the top-ranked irrelevant image, and the squared Frobenius norm of the similarity function parameter. This minimization problem is solved as a quadratic programming problem. The experiments over two benchmark data sets show the advantages of the proposed method over other similarity learning methods when the top precision is used as the performance measure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe experiments over some benchmark databases show its advantages over other similarity learning methods. In the future, we will investigate to use some other similarity function as similarity measure instead of linear function, such as Bayesian network [12], [13], [14], and also to develop novel algorithms of other machine learning problems and applications besides similarity learning, to maximize top precision measure, such as importance sampling [15], [16], [17], portfolio choices [18], [19], multimedia technology [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], computational biology [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], big data processing [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], computer vision [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], information security [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], and medical imaging [60], [61], [62], etc.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSupervised learning of sparse context reconstruction coefficients for data representation and classification\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMYin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBEdwards\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPXu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNeural Computing and Applications\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMultiple kernel multivariate performance learning using cutting plane algorithm\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYZhou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNMcdonald\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSystems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIEEE\n\t\t\t2015. 2015\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSupervised cross-modal factor analysis for multiple modal data classification\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYZhou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKDuan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJJ\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t-YWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHBensmail\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSystems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIEEE\n\t\t\t2015. 2015\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA synthesis of feedback and feedforward control for process improvement under stationary and nonstationary time series disturbance models\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLShi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKCKapur\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tQuality and Reliability Engineering International\n\t\t\n\t\t\t31\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMargin-based over-sampling method for learning from imbalanced datasets\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXFan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKTang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWeise\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the 15th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-2011)\n\t\tthe 15th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-2011)Berlin Heidelberg\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpringer\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPortfolio choices with orthogonal bandit learning\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWShen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tY.-GJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHZha\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\tthe 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The experimental results from a large scale image database show that the proposed algorithm can outperform the original feature on image retrieval problem. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nProgressive loss of retinal ganglion cell function precedes structural loss by several years in glaucoma suspects\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMBanitt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLVentura\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWFeuer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tESavatovsky\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGLuna\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOShif\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBBosse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVPorciatti\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInvestigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science\n\t\t\n\t\t\t54\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEfficient gradient descent algorithm for sparse models with application in learning-to-rank\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHLai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYPan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYTang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNLiu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tKnowledge-Based Systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\t49\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA hybrid method of modified cat swarm optimization and gradient descent algorithm for training anfis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMOrouskhani\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMMansouri\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYOrouskhani\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMTeshnehlab\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications\n\t\t\n\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t2013\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWavpeak: picking nmr peaks through wavelet-based smoothing and volumebased filtering\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAbbas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tB.-YJing\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXGao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBioinformatics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t28\n\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2012\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMultiphase support vector regression for function approximation with breakpoints\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNKim\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJeong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKShin\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of the Operational Research Society\n\t\t\n\t\t\t64\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tReducing the number of support vectors of svm classifiers using the smoothed separable case approximation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGeebelen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJSuykens\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJVandewalle\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2012\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDaily forecasting of dam water levels: Comparing a support vector machine (svm) model with adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (anfis)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAHipni\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAEl-Shafie\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tANajah\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOKarim\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAHussain\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMMukhlisin\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWater Resources Management\n\t\t\n\t\t\t27\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tUncovering overlapping cluster structures via stochastic competitive learning\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTSilva\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLZhao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInformation Sciences\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAbductive learning of quantized stochastic processes with probabilistic finite automata\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIChattopadhyay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHLipson\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences\n\t\t\n\t\t\t371\n\t\t\t1984. 2013\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The color of the pH indicator changes from yellow to blue and finally purple to indicate spoilage, which can be easily detected by the naked eye. The asprepared pH indicator exhibited good response to pH changes on the surface of chicken breast meat, and no migration of the dye from the indicator onto the surface of the chicken was observed.

Studies using the same principle have been reported by Kuswandi et al. (2).However, to the best of our knowledge, research on real-time monitoring of product freshness has mainly focused on the color changes of indicators in packaging headspace (2-4,14-16). Onpackage sensors containing pH-sensitive dyes only respond to volatile spoilage compounds in the headspace evolved from the surface of foods. In other words, these non-direct-contact methods require some headspace and respond only to volatile spoilage compounds. Therefore, these technologies are limited as they do not respond to compounds dissolved on the surface of products. However, for safety reasons, the problem of dye migration into food products must be taken into account for direct-contact-type indicators.The purpose of this study was to develop a real-time pH-indicating monitor based on bromocresol purple (BCP) suitable for direct contact with chicken breast surfaces.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve its color change sensitivity, it was immobilized with polyvinyl alcohol and a high-absorbance material.

As the number of food products increases and their packaging types diversify, the food industry must address concerns regarding the shelf-life and safety of packed food products (1)(2)(3)(4)(5). Consequently, innovative and creative packaging technologies that exhibit active and intelligent functions, both in terms of shelf-life extension and quality monitoring, have been developed (1,5).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo prevent the migration of BCP into the chicken breast, it was immobilized with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and a high-absorbance pad. As shown in Fig. 1, the pH indicator in this study was designed as a three-layered structure with a super-absorbent pad, which was used to prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve the color change sensitivity of BCP. The effectiveness of the pH indicator was examined by attaching it to the surface of chicken breasts stored at 4 and 10 o C. The indicator response was correlated with pH, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) content, bacterial growth, and changes in the surface color of the chicken breast. This color-based pH indicator was successfully prepared and tested for the visual monitoring of the real-time freshness of chicken breast in direct contact mode.\nMaterials and MethodsMaterials BCP (dye content 90%) as the dye, 98.0-99.5% hydrolyzed PVA (average molecular weight: 17,500 g/mol) as the binder, and filter paper (Whatman TM Filter Paper No.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We recognize that MendNano is a dynamic model though many aspects in the publication appear to rely primarily on steady state assumptions. As the authors of MendNano, we are sure that Cohen et al. are more familiar with their model than anyone else. Generalizations on our part may be due to limited space. Second, our statement regarding MendNano's capabilities was not that the model cannot be used to look at different land uses or water types, but rather that from the published works, we were under the impression that only one type can be considered at a time.We did not consider nor state that dissolution is independent of particle size. Rather that, as a screening tool, we chose to limit the complexity required by introducing particle size distribution not unlike other existing models and most MFA models. [2][3][4] This necessitated simplifying the calculations so that the amount of data necessary to run the model was manageable. In addition, we felt that modeling dissolution patterns at the individual particle scale when trying to represent a much larger region would not be efficient.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, until recently, few studies have examined associations between physical activity and health in young children. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between physical activity and selected health outcomes in children younger than 6 yr.\nMethods: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies examining the associations between physical activity and adiposity/weight status, bone health, cardiometabolic health, and cognition in children younger than 6 yr.\nResults: Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and served as the basis for this systematic review. For weight status/adiposity, 12 of 15 studies found negative associations between physical activity and one or more measures of the outcome. For bone health, 10 articles based on four studies were identified, and nine studies showed stronger bone in more active children. For cardiometabolic health, three studies were identified and findings were limited and inconsistent. For cognition, two systematic reviews were identified and findings were limited. For all four health outcomes, evidence of dose-response relationships and effect modification by demographic factors was very limited.\nConclusions: There is strong evidence indicating that higher amounts of physical activity are associated with better indicators of bone health and with reduced risk for excessive increases in weight and adiposity in children 3 to 6 yr. Evidence was too limited to support conclusions regarding the effects of physical activity on cardiometabolic health and cognition. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMethodological quality of meta-analyses on the blood pressure response to exercise: a review\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBTJohnson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHVMacdonald\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLBruneauJr\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTUGoldsby\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJCBrown\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTBHuedo-Medina\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1097/HJH.0000000000000097\n\t\t24463936\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Hypertens\n\t\t\n\t\t\t32\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical activity and adiposity: a longitudinal study from birth to childhood\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRIBerkowitz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWSAgras\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAFKorner\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHCKraemer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCHZeanah\n\t\t\n\t\t3998913\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Pediatr\n\t\t\n\t\t\t106\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1985\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDiscrepancies in article selection or data abstractions were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer if needed.

One way to achieve a sustainable future in urban areas and remote communities is to use the independent renewable energy systems. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common sources of energy generation that has attracted of the world. The present study provides the comprehensive examine the performance of two parabolic dish collector and flat-plate collector from energy, exergy, Enviroeconomic and Exergoenviroeconomic view of points. To examine the performance of solar systems, the climatic conditions of two different cities in Asia (Beijing and Tehran) have been used. In addition, the performance of the systems is investigated under different parameters and using different working fluids and MWCNT nanoparticle. It was found that the both solar systems have better overall performance in Tehran than in Beijing. Moreover, in the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months. In addition, the lowest and highest Levelized Cost of Energy are belong to dish collector (in Tehran with water) and flat plate collector (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively. For Tehran, LCOE of dish collector increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition, the impact of the use of nanofluids on the performance of systems is investigated. Dowtherm Q is a synthetic organic HTF containing a mixture of alkylated aromatics and diphenylethane. Compared to hot oils, it represents better thermal consistency and significantly better low-temperature pump ability.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMWCNT has extraordinary thermal properties and can be widely used industrially and commercially as a new generation of refrigerants and thermal operating fluids. The use of these nanofluids in thermal systems can increase the efficiency and significantly increase the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient in equal Reynolds. This group of nanofluids in different base fluids such as ethylene glycol and water with suitable stability can be provided. The physical properties of the nanofluid should be determined based on the nanoparticle and base fluid physical properties. These properties include viscosity, density, thermal conductivity and specific heat Ehyaei et al. (2019). The physical properties of nanofluids can be obtained using the following equations (Khanjari et al. 2016;Loni et al. 2017;Zadeh et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDifferent heat transfer fluidsIn this subsection, the FPC and PDC performances with various HTFs is investigated. These heat transfer fluids include water, Dowtherm Q, and water/MWCNT and Dowtherm Q/MWCNT nanofluids. Fig. 11 shows the SEM image and XRD graph of MWCNT particles. The diameter of MWCNT is between 20 nm and 50 nm. It has been shown that the performance of a solar collector can be significantly improved by adding amounts of nanoparticles to the working fluid. The benefit of nanofluids as a working fluid raises the thermal conductivity, which leads to more thermal energy production. In other words, by increasing the thermal conductivity, more thermal energy is produced at higher temperatures. That is, the difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the solar collector increases. Fig. 12 shows the thermal conductivity of different HTFs versus particle volume fraction. Obviously, by adding nanoparticle to the working fluids, the value of k of the heat transfer fluid increases. For instance, at \u03c6 = 5%, the value of k of water/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.36% higher than that of water.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Both positive social interactions and stress are known to induce OXT secretion, but the relative influence of either of these triggers is not well delineated. Choir singing is an activity known to improve mood and to induce feelings of social closeness, and may therefore be used to investigate the effects of positive social experiences on OXT system activity. We quantified mood and salivary OXT and cortisol (CORT) concentrations before, during, and after both choir and solo singing performed in a randomized order in the same participants (repeated measures). Happiness was increased, and worry and sadness as well as salivary CORT concentrations were reduced, after both choir and solo singing. Surprisingly, salivary OXT concentrations were significantly reduced after choir singing, but did not change in response to solo singing. Salivary OXT concentrations showed high intra-individual stability, whereas salivary CORT concentrations fluctuated between days within participants. The present data indicate that the social experience of choir singing does not induce peripheral OXT secretion, as indicated by unchanged salivary OXT levels. Rather, the reduction of stress/arousal experienced during choir singing may lead to an inhibition of peripheral OXT secretion. These data are important for the interpretation of future reports on salivary OXT concentrations, and emphasize the need to strictly control for stress/arousal when designing similar experiments. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis hypothesis was based on two lines of reasoning: (i) an earlier study reporting an increase in salivary OXT concentrations (139% of basal) after 30 min of choir rehearsal, including 10 min of warm-up exercises and repeatedly singing the pop-song ''California Dreaming'' (Kreutz, 2014); and (ii) reports of other positive social experiences resulting in OXT secretion, such as intense parent-child interactions, massage, gossiping with friends, and loving interactions between participants and their dogs (Grewen et al., 2005;Gonzaga et al., 2006;Feldman et al., 2010;Beetz et al., 2013;Kim et al., 2014;Tsuji et al., 2015;Krause et al., 2016;Lebowitz et al., 2016;Brondino et al., 2017).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, if stress is not properly controlled for, an increase in peripheral OXT concentrations may be falsely interpreted as a ''pro-social'' rather than a stress response.The current experiment was designed to assess salivary OXT and CORT concentrations in male and female healthy volunteers in response to a positive social challenge: choir singing. In general, choir singing is known to improve mental and physical health and overall quality of life (Clift et al., 2010;Chanda and Levitin, 2013;Coulton et al., 2015). A single choir singing session improves mood and increases trust, cooperative behavior, and feelings of social closeness in the singers (Anshel and Kipper, 1988;Weinstein et al., 2016) while reducing anxiety and other negative feelings (Kreutz et al., 2004;Kreutz, 2014;Fancourt et al., 2016). OXT has been proposed to represent the biological link between the intense social experience of choir singing and its positive psychosocial effects (Chanda and Levitin, 2013;Kreutz, 2014).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOf course, it may be that positive bilateral interactions or the powerful intimate bond between parents and their children, romantic partners, or dogs and their owners are needed to trigger the OXT system to a quantifiable extent-aspects that are missing from choir singing.It is possible that increases or decreases in stress/arousal, rather than social experience, drives salivary OXT concentrations. In other words, singing may cause an increase (or a decrease) in stress signals from the brain stem and/or amygdala to the hypothalamus, resulting in the activation (or quiescence) of the HPA axis and the OXT system. If this is true, it can be expected that CORT responses resemble OXT responses to singing. This was indeed the case in previous studies: Kreutz (2014) reported an increase in both OXT and CORT concentrations after choir singing (but note that the reported CORT values were supraphysiologically high), whereas Fancourt et al. (2016) reported a decrease in both OXT and CORT concentrations.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

While this process is critical to all multicellular organisms, the proteins that form gap junction channels are not conserved. Vertebrate gap junctions are formed by connexins, while invertebrate gap junctions are formed by innexins. Interestingly, vertebrates and lower chordates contain innexin homologs, the pannexins, which also form channels, but rarely (if ever) make intercellular channels. While the connexin and the innexin/pannexin polypeptides do not share significant sequence similarity, all three of these protein families share a similar membrane topology and some similarities in quaternary structure.

In this study, we investigated the role of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel-mediated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in purinergic-mediated disassembly of adherens and tight junction complexes in early tubular injury.\nMethods: Human primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTECs) and clonal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were treated with Transforming Growth Factor Beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) \u00b1 apyrase, or ATP\u03b3S for 48 h. For inhibitor studies, cells were co-incubated with Cx43 mimetic Peptide 5, or purinergic receptor antagonists Suramin, A438079 or A804598. Immunoblotting, single-cell force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assessed protein expression, cell-cell adhesion and paracellular permeability. Carboxyfluorescein uptake and biosensing measured hemichannel activity and real-time ATP release, whilst a heterozygous Cx43+/- mouse model with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) assessed the role of Cx43 in vivo.\nResults: Immunohistochemistry of biopsy material from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed increased expression of purinergic receptor P2X7. TGF-\u03b21 increased Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity and ATP release in hPTECs and HK2 cells. The cytokine reduced maximum unbinding forces and reduced cell-cell adhesion, which translated to increased paracellular permeability. Changes were reversed when cells were co-incubated with either Peptide 5 or P2-purinoceptor inhibitors. Cx43+/- mice did not exhibit protein changes associated with early tubular injury in a UUO model of fibrosis.\nConclusion: Data suggest that Cx43 mediated ATP release represents an initial trigger in early tubular injury via its actions on the adherens and tight junction complex. Since Cx43 is highly expressed in nephropathy, it represents a novel target for intervention of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CKD. Video Abstract In proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), tight junction proteins, including zona occuludens-1 (ZO-1), contribute to epithelial integrity, whilst the adherens junction protein epithelial (E)-cadherin (ECAD) maintains cell-cell coupling, facilitating connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and the direct transfer of small molecules and ions between cells. In disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) binds to its receptor and recruits SMAD2/3 signalling ahead of changes in gene transcription and up-regulation of Cx43-mediated hemichannels (HC). Uncoupled hemichannels permit the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in to the extracellular space (\u2191[ATP]e), where ATP binds to the P2X7 purinoreceptor and activates the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inflammation results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibrosis and tubular injury. A major consequence is further loss of ECAD and reduced stickiness between cells, which can be functionally measured as a decrease in the maximum unbinding force needed to uncouple two adherent cells (Fmax). Loss of ECAD feeds forward to further lessen cell-cell coupling exacerbating the switch from GJIC to HC-mediated release of ATP. Reduction in ZO-1 impedes tight junction effectiveness and decreases trans-epithelial resistance (\u2193TER), resulting in increased paracellular permeability. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor all experiments, inhibitors alone failed to induce any significant change in expression.\nPeptide 5 inhibits TGF-\u03b21-induced Cx43 hemichannel activity and ATP releaseTo study the efficacy of Peptide 5 in blocking Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity in renal tubule epithelial cells, HK2 and hPTECs were incubated in TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/mL) \u00b1 Peptide 5 (25 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Dye uptake increased in TGF-\u03b21-treated HK2 cells to 609.4 \u00b1 46% compared to unstimulated control (Fig. 6a &b), whilst co-incubation with Peptide 5 reduced uptake to 163 \u00b1 10.2%. Co-incubation with scrambled peptide failed to blunt the TGF-\u03b21 response (671.5 \u00b1 29.5%, Fig. 6a &b). The effects were matched in primary hPTECS, where Peptide 5 significantly reduced uptake to 141.7 \u00b1 16.3% from 311.2 \u00b1 39.6% in TGF-\u03b21 treated cells (Fig. 6c &d).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese observations, can most likely be explained by studies confirming a role for ATP metabolites in regulating expression of tight junction proteins, [50,51] and are further supported by observations that TGF-\u03b21 evoked changes in tight junction expression are blunted when cells are co-incubated with adenosine receptor antagonist; Suramin. The origin of this deleterious signal was confirmed in TGF-\u03b21 treated cells preincubated with Peptide 5. Peptide 5 is a 12 amino acid peptide which targets the 2nd extracellular loop of Cx43 [52], it has been proven successful in blocking Cx43 hemichannels when delivered topically, intraocularly [53], into cerbebrospinal fluid and systemically [52]. Multiple approaches have been used to confirm target applicability and specificity and all have yielded similar and significant benefits across different injury models. The ability of Peptide 5 to block hemichannel activity, ATP-release and ultimately disassembly of the adherens/tight junction complex in our model system, was assessed by carboxyfluorescein dye uptake, ATP-biosensing and Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHuman renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were incubated with TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/mL) \u00b1 Peptide 5 (25 \u03bcM) for 48 h.

This family of membrane proteins is the molecular constituent of gap junction channels and hemichannels that provide pathways for direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm and inside-out exchange, respectively. Both types of Cx channels are permeable to ions and small signaling molecules allowing astrocytes to establish dynamic interactions with neurons. So far, most pharmacological approaches currently available do not distinguish between these two channel functions, stressing the need to develop new specific molecular tools. In astrocytes two major Cxs are expressed, Cx43 and Cx30, and there is now evidence indicating that at least Cx43 operates as a gap junction channel as well as a hemichannel in these cells. Based on studies in primary cultures as well as in acute hippocampal slices, we report here that Gap19, a nonapeptide derived from the cytoplasmic loop of Cx43, inhibits astroglial Cx43 hemichannels in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting gap junction channels. This peptide, which not only selectively inhibits hemichannels but is also specific for Cx43, can be delivered in vivo in mice as TAT-Gap19, and displays penetration into the brain parenchyma. As a result, Gap19 combined with other tools opens up new avenues to decipher the role of Cx43 hemichannels in interactions between astrocytes and neurons in physiological as well as pathological situations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn some cases, distinctive effects on hemichannels and gap junctions depend on the concentration at which they are applied: peptide5, which contains a sequence that comprises part of the Gap27 domain (SRPTEKT), inhibits hemichannels at low (5 \u03bcM) concentration while combined gap junction/hemichannel block is only observed at high (500 \u03bcM) concentration (O'carroll et al., 2008).Here, we describe the effect on astroglial hemichannels of a peptide, named Gap19, that is identical to a short sequence present on the intracellular CL domain of Cx43 (Figure 1). Peptides mimicking CL sequences have been frequently used as control peptides for gap junction work, since it was shown that these do not inhibit gap junctional coupling (Evans and Leybaert, 2007). Although this specificity has already been reported for the cardiac system (Wang et al., 2013b) we think that it is important to validate this property for the nervous system.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPeptides and peptide-derived molecules targeting the intracellular domains of Cx43: gap junctions versus hemichannels\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJIyyathurai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNDe Bock\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMHimpens\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBRetamal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMA\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.04.050\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNeuropharmacology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t75\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe connexin43 C-terminal region mediates neuroprotection during stroke\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGKozoriz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJFBechberger\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGRBechberger\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMWSuen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAPMoreno\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKMaass\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181cd44df\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

In a previous experimental work, in-vitro expanded bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were demonstrated to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a rat preclinical model. In the present article we investigated whether unexpanded BM mononuclear cells (MNC) may also be effective.\nMethods\nThirty-two rats, divided into groups, underwent sphincterotomy and repair (SR) with primary suture of anal sphincters plus intrasphincteric injection of saline (CTR), or of in-vitro expanded MSC, or of minimally manipulated MNC; moreover, the fourth group underwent sham operation. At day 30, histologic, morphometric, in-vitro contractility, and functional analysis were performed.\nResults\nTreatment with both MSC and MNC improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after SR compared with CTR (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant difference was observed between the two BM stem cell types used. GFP-positive cells (MSC and MNC) remained in the proximity of the lesion site up to 30 days post injection.\nConclusions\nIn the present study we demonstrated in a preclinical model that minimally manipulated BM-MNC were as effective as in-vitro expanded MSC for the recovery of anal sphincter injury followed by primary sphincter repair. These results may serve as a basis for improving clinical applications of stem cell therapy in human anal incontinence treatment. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBackgroundAnal incontinence is a disabling condition that adversely affects the quality of life of a considerable number of patients (2-15 % of the general population) [1,2]. Injury of the anal sphincters (mainly post surgical or post delivery) is the most common cause of incontinence, and surgical repair is actually the treatment of choice.

In a previous experimental work, in-vitro expanded bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were demonstrated to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a rat preclinical model. In the present article we investigated whether unexpanded BM mononuclear cells (MNC) may also be effective.\nMethods\nThirty-two rats, divided into groups, underwent sphincterotomy and repair (SR) with primary suture of anal sphincters plus intrasphincteric injection of saline (CTR), or of in-vitro expanded MSC, or of minimally manipulated MNC; moreover, the fourth group underwent sham operation. At day 30, histologic, morphometric, in-vitro contractility, and functional analysis were performed.\nResults\nTreatment with both MSC and MNC improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after SR compared with CTR (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant difference was observed between the two BM stem cell types used. GFP-positive cells (MSC and MNC) remained in the proximity of the lesion site up to 30 days post injection.\nConclusions\nIn the present study we demonstrated in a preclinical model that minimally manipulated BM-MNC were as effective as in-vitro expanded MSC for the recovery of anal sphincter injury followed by primary sphincter repair. These results may serve as a basis for improving clinical applications of stem cell therapy in human anal incontinence treatment. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBackgroundAnal incontinence is a disabling condition that adversely affects the quality of life of a considerable number of patients (2-15 % of the general population) [1,2].

Surgical repair remains the operation of choice; however, the outcome often is poor. We investigated the ability of injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a preclinical model.\nMethods: Twenty-four inbred Wistar Furth rats were divided into three groups. As a control, Group A underwent sham operation. Group B had sphincterotomy and repair of both anal sphincters plus saline injections. The study group (Group C) underwent sphincterotomy and repair followed by intrasphincteric injections of syngenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. A further group (Group D) of outbred Wistar rats treated with mesenchymal stem cells and immunosuppressive therapy also was evaluated. At 30 days, histologic and morphometric analysis and in vitro contractility testing was performed.\nResults: A significant decrease of muscle tissue was observed at the site of repair after sphincter injury. However, in Groups C and D, histologic examination demonstrated new muscle fibers and morphometric analysis revealed a significantly greater muscle area fraction than in Group B (P < 0.05). Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells injection improved contractility of sphincters strips compared with Group B (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between Groups C and D.\nConclusions: In our experimental model, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells injection improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after injury and repair. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells may represent an attractive tool for treating anal sphincter lesions in humans. Investigations into the biologic basis of this phenomenon should increase our knowledge on underlying mechanisms involved in sphincter repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nStem cells could be injected at the moment of surgical repair or percutaneously by ultrasonographic guide in selected injured areas and improve the regeneration and the healing of damaged anal sphincters. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm and expand our preliminary results before attempting this in the clinical setting.FIGURE 1 .1FIGURE 1. Histologic examination after four weeks. The external anal sphincter (EAS) appeared more compact than the internal anal sphincter (IAS) (Group A, a). In Group B, a gap filled with fibrous connective tissue and dilated blood vessels was observed within each muscle layer at the site of sphincter repair (SR) (b). Injected MSC led to increased sphincter mass at the site of SR in Group C (c) and Group D (d). m = mucosa; arrows = residual suture material (original magnification; 4x) (Group A: sham; Group B: SR + saline; Group C: SR + MSC; Group D: SR + MSC + CsA).

Cross-sections at 3-\u03bcm to 5-\u03bcm thickness were cut with a Reichert Jung microtome (Leica Microsystems, Milan, Italy) along a horizontal plane, stained with 0.1 percent toluidine blue, and then observed under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Florence, Italy).To evaluate the regeneration of the sphincters at the site of surgery, a quantitative morphometric study using a computer-assisted image analysis was performed in stained samples.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA nal incontinence is a disabling condition that affects a large number of patients and may have devastating effects on quality of life. 1,2 The mechanism of continence is complex and involves many structures and pathways. Disruption of the anal sphincters is one of the most common causes of anal incontinence and may occur as the result of obstetric injury, anorectal surgery, or trauma. [3][4][5][6][7][8] Sphincter repair is the operation of choice in patients with damaged anal sphincters, and clinical series have reported a relatively good success rate after treatment. However, the initial symptomatic improvement is not always maintained with time and long-term outcome remains unsatisfactory. [9][10][11][12][13][14] Many reports have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (MSC) can differentiate into mature cells of many tissues. 15,16 In particular, injected MSC engraft and form multinucleated myotubes in skeletal muscle under appropriate stimuli, i.e., injury, contributing to muscle regeneration.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) and other antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were tested for by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. Positive results for Scl 70 antibodies were obtained in 77% of cases of diffuse scleroderma and 44% of acrosclerosis. ACA and Scl 70 antibodies were found to be mutually exclusive. If acrosclerosis cases positive for anticentromere antibodies are excluded, the percentage of acrosclerosis cases positive for Scl 70 was 63%. ACA were found to be a marker of a benign, abortive subset of acrosclerosis with almost no cutaneous involvement (CREST), whereas Scl 70 did not discriminate between acrosclerosis and diffuse scleroderma. On HEp-2 cells Scl 70 positive sera gave a characteristic, fine speckled, almost homogeneous nuclear staining pattern. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNucleolar staining without any associated patterns was found in five cases, four of acrosclerosis and one of diffuse scleroderma, all negative for Scl 70.\nDISCUSSIONScl 70 antibody was found to be a specific serological marker of systemic scleroderma. In our series it was detected at a much higher frequency than reported in previous publications (Tan et al., 1980;Catoggio et al., 1983), but comparable results have been reported recently by Takehara,Moroi and Ishibashi (t985).

Thus, it does not discriminate between the subsets of systemic scleroderma. There were only slight clinical differences between cases positive and negative for Scl 70.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese are considered to be a marker of CREST (Tan et al.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n394Maria  by Tan et al.

However, how skin grafts help to heal wounds is not entirely known. Why epithelium from grafted skin is able to migrate and cover these wounds, while epithelium at the edge of nonhealing wounds is unable to, is a long unanswered biologic question.\nObservations: The recent use of cultured epithelial allografts has rekindled interest in the biology of skin grafts. Replaced, even in chronic wounds, by recipient epithelium, cultured epithelial allografts appear to work by providing a potent stimulus to healing imparted by the graft itself. Based on this, we have reassessed how skin autografts help to heal wounds and hypothesize that, in a similar fashion, autografts may work not only by replacing tissue but also by providing a stimulus for healing.\nConclusions: We suggest that skin grafts may work not only as tissue replacement but as pharmacologic agents that provide a stimulus for healing. We believe that, someday, it may be possible to augment the stimulatory properties of donor skin to speed healing of the recipient wound. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n\"6 Other authors8,19 have noted this so-called edge effect, and some have also ex\u00ac pressed the idea that the epithelial cells elaborate growth factors responsible for the rapid reepithelial\u00ac ization of the wounds.20,21 If, as it appears, growth fac\u00ac tors are in some way responsible for the rapid healing of chronic ulcers after cultured epithelial allografting, then perhaps \"dosing\" of these growth factors with re- peated grafts may be important. Toward that end, Beele and coworkers22 were recently successful in treating chronic leg ulcers with repeated cultured epi\u00ac dermal allografts, suggesting that repeated \"doses\" are needed in some patients to aid in wound healing. They noted healing from the edge with each successive graft.It is possible that traditional skin grafting using the patient's own skin without in vitro expansion may work, in part, due to growth factors supplied by the patient's own healthy donor skin. The donor skin transplanted to a nonhealing chronic wound may bring with it factors or the capacity to elaborate factors ab\u00ac sent or deficient in the recipient area.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPossibly, the stratum corneum, which is known to act as a reser\u00ac voir,23 or other cells in the grafted tissue, may act as a transport for needed endogenous \"growth factors.\" It is well known that acute wounds produce growth fac\u00ac tors that stimulate healing.24 These factors supplied by the newly grafted skin may significantly contribute to the eventual healing of the wound. In addition, the newly grafted skin may serve to stimulate matrix for\u00ac mation or the release of inflammatory mediators. Most grafting techniques (pinch grafting or mesh grafting)do not cover all of the ulcer to conserve donor tissue.A continued stimulus for reepithelialization is required to resurface the remainder of the ulcer and is likely provided by the newly transplanted skin. This is con\u00ac sistent with previous observations made with regard to skin grafting. O'Donoghue and Zarem25 showed that free skin grafts become vascularized, suggesting that the grafted tissue causes host blood vessels to grow into the graft. They also noted that fresh grafts are more efficient at attracting blood vessels than frozen- thawed grafts, suggesting a donor-dependent process.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nCultured human epidermal cells do not synthesize HLA-DR\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVBMofhenn\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJBenike\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJCox\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDJCharron\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEGEngelman\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Invest Dermatol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t78\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1982\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLoss of HLA-DR expression by human epidermal cells after growth in culture\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMHefton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJBAmberson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGBiozes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMEWeksler\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Invest Dermatol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t83\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1984\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tProgressive replacement of human cultured epithelial allografts by recipient cells as evidenced by HLA class I antigens expression\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVGielen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMFaure\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGMauduit\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJThivolet\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDermatologica\n\t\t\n\t\t\t175\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1987\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The location of the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. relative to the ostium of the celiac trunk was identified on the aortic wall. Following this, the locations of the ostia of the renal aa. on the internal wall of the abdominal aorta were examined relative to the ostia of the arteries mentioned earlier. The ostium of the superior mesenteric a. was usually localized on the inferior-fight side of the ostium of the celiac trunk. The mean value of the distance between the ostia was 17.9 mm. The ostium of the right renal a. was more cranial than the ostium of the left renal a. (53.3%). However, the ostia of both right and left renal aa. were at the same level in three cases (10%). Locations of the ostia of the renal aa. were usually on the lateral and anterolateral regions of the aortic wall. This study was carried out in order to contribute to selective angiography and surgical interventions for the removal and transplantation of organs, particularly of the kidney. Our results are compared with previous similar studies in man.  \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nto be 55.7% [10]. Our findings were more compatible with the findings of Odman and Ranniger, since the incidence of lateral and anterolateral locations were 48.3% and 31.6%, respectively. According to Odman and Ranniger, the ostium of the right renal a. was located more on the anterior wall and that of the left renal a. on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta. These authors also reported that renal aa. originating from the anterior wall had a more cranial position near the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. [ 10].We found that renal ostia on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta had a cranial, but ostia on the anterolateral wall a caudal position. This result accounted for the more cranial position of the right renal ostium in relation to the left renal ostium. Extreme (anterior or posterior wall) locations of renal ostia on the aortic wall have been reported to be related to developmental variations of the mesonephric aa.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nrdnale gauche (53,3 %).

We re-examine a breccia pipe in the Bushveld Complex to investigate the role of volatile fluid overpressure in its emplacement. This 10-m-diameter breccia pipe was emplaced vertically in the anorthosite of the Upper Critical Zone of the Bushveld Complex and contains blocks of Bushveld anorthosite, norite, and pyroxenite, apparently derived from lower in the stratigraphy. The blocks are commonly elongate, and are tightly packed within an ultramafic pegmatite groundmass. Ultramafic pegmatitic dikes radiate bilaterally from the pipe. Microprobe analyses of plagioclase in the breccia pipe blocks reveal that these grains are unzoned and have higher anorthosite content (~An85) than host rock plagioclase (~An75), indicating that the breccia pipe blocks were transported considerable vertical distances. Whole-rock major- and trace-element data show enrichment in fluid-soluble incompatible elements, supporting the role of volatile fluids in the formation of the pipe. A model is examined in which the segregation of a fluid phase from interstitial liquids in the cumulate section below the breccia pipe leads to the development of sufficient overpressure for its explosive emplacement. Fluid overpressure can develop by compaction and during crystallization of plagioclase-saturated silicate liquids as fluids exsolve from the solidifying interstitial liquid. If fluids separate faster than they can escape from the crystal pile, significant overpressures can develop. The minimum fluidization velocity which would be required to emplace blocks of the size and density found within the breccia pipe is found to be 10\u2013110 m/s. The crystallization model predicts the development of about 400 bar of overpressure, an amount calculated to be sufficient for pipe emplacement. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis overpressure is in addition to any overpressure from derived compaction in the crystallizing pile. Thus, as seen in Fig. 12, the base of the chamber comprises solid degassed cumulates, with no porosity. This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber.Because the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others. Fluids are likely to collect in those rocks which have significant residual porosity. These gas-rich regions may be interconnected via pegmatitic channel ways and fractures. Conversely, rocks with low permeability can act as ''caps'' preventing the escape of fluids. When an escape channel does develop, the fluid escapes violently.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis can lead to an overpressured situation. For example, Burnham (1979) has shown how differentiation-induced redistribution of water in a magma body can lead to local vapor saturation and to the rapid upward migration of the vapor. Furthermore, the effect of degassing a fluid on magma pressures and on the eruption behavior of a shallow magma chamber has been examined by Tait et al. (1989). Boudreau (1992) broadened the discussion of the physical effects of the exsolution of a volatile phase by examining how degassing may cause overpressure in a solidifying crystal pile. In this study, we apply a crystallization model in order to determine how much overpressure is developed during the crystallization of a volatile, saturated interstitial liquid which crystallizes isochorically (constant volume).We applied the PELE silicate-liquid crystallization model of Boudreau (1999), a PC-platform program based on the MELTS thermodynamic model of Ghiorso and Sack (1995).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn fact, pressure on the interstitial liquid drops dramatically. This decrease in pressure results from a net crystallization contraction in most crystallizing silicate phases -the solids take up less volume than the liquid (Peterson 1987). By contrast, in those isochoric runs where the crystallizing interstitial liquid is initially water saturated, significant overpressure can develop (Fig. 10). In all three cases, fluids were exsolved continually over the course of crystallization, but overpressure developed only when plagioclase joined the liquidus. This result is due to a relatively higher molar volume of plagioclase compared with that of the interstitial liquid. Thus, for overpressure to develop, the combined crystallization expansion of plagioclase and exsolution of water is required to overcome the crystallization contraction of the other crystallizing phases. Furthermore, the isochoric P-T plot of fluid-saturated magmas demonstrates that an overpressure of about 400 bar can be generated.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Because the liver is susceptible to toxin- or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth. Specifically, in response to injury, quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and undergo DNA replication to promote liver regrowth. Despite the elucidation of a number of regenerative factors, the mechanisms by which liver injury triggers hepatocyte proliferation are incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that eosinophils stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and toxin-mediated injury. Liver injury results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to promote the proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Surprisingly, signaling via the IL-4R\u03b1 in macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue repair, is dispensable for hepatocyte proliferation and liver regrowth after injury. Instead, IL-4 exerts its proliferative actions via IL-4R\u03b1 in hepatocytes. Our findings thus provide a unique mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS4 A and B). These results highlight a previously unappreciated role for eosinophils in inducing hepatocyte proliferation after injury and implicate eosinophil-derived factors in the orchestration of liver regeneration.Eosinophils Recruited to Injured Liver Secrete IL-4. Among the factors secreted by eosinophils, IL-4 has been implicated in both wound repair and liver regeneration (8,12,(19)(20)(21). We thus evaluated the competence of eosinophils for IL-4 secretion in injured liver. After CCl 4 -induced liver injury, eosinophils, which can be distinguished by their expression of sialic acid-binding Ig receptor (Siglec-F) (15), were the predominant cell type competent for IL-4 secretion (Fig. 2A and Fig. S5B) in IL-4 reporter mice (4get mice), a knock-in strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the IL-4 locus (22). Similarly, partial hepatectomy in 4get mice demonstrated that \u223c81-84% of GFP + cells were eosinophils (Fig. 2B and Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n4M). Although the initial extent of liver damage was similar in both groups of mice (Fig. S10A), hepatocyte proliferation, as fied by nuclear staining for K i 67 (Fig. S10B), was increased by \u223c22% in IL-4-treated animals (Fig. 4N). Furthermore, this increase in hepatocyte proliferation was associated with a \u223c43% decrease in necrotic cell area (Fig. 4O and Fig. S10C), suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of IL-4 in acute liver injury.\nDiscussionThe regenerative capacity of the liver in part reflects its susceptibility to damage by ingested toxins and pathogenic infections. As such, multiple homeostatic mechanisms are activated on injury to initiate liver regeneration, each contributing only partially to the restoration of liver function (1,2). Here, we have demonstrated a role for eosinophils in orchestrating the regrowth of liver after injury. Moreover, our work has elucidated a direct mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 signals via the hepatocyte IL-4R\u03b1 to stimulate liver regeneration.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause the liver is susceptible to toxin-or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth.

These include nanobainite steel [citation 36].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The role of retained austenite on tensile properties of steels with bainitic microstructures \nAbstract: In high-carbon, silicon-rich steels it is possible to obtain a very fine bainitic microstructure by transformation at low temperatures (200\u2013300\u00b0C). This microstructure consists of slender ferrite plates, with thicknesses of several tens of nm, in a matrix of retained austenite. Whereas strength is mainly provided by to the fine scale of the ferrite plates (stronger phase), ductility is mostly controlled by the retained austenite (softer phase). Further improvement in ductility is achieved by strain induced transformation of austenite to martensite, the so called TRIP effect. In order to take full advantage of this effect, the mechanical stability of the austenite, i.e., its capability to transform to martensite under strain, must not be too low nor excessively high.\nTwo main aspects of the mechanical stability of the retained austenite, morphology and chemical composition, have been studied to determine the role that these play on the ductility behaviour of the bainitic steels studied. It is suggested that the chemical composition has the strongest effect on the ductility of these new high strength alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDuctility, measured as total elongation (\" T ), decreases as the strength increases. The microstructures obtained by transformation at 300 C exhibit a total elongation close to 30% for both alloys, very high values when compared with those obtained by transformation at 200 C, where the elongation is reduced to 4.6 and 7.6% for alloys 1 and 2, respectively. Figure 4 represents the strength vs. total elongation for bainitic steels from the literature [23][24][25] and for those studied in this work. It can be clearly seen that the tensile properties reported in this work has never before been achieved in bainitic steels.It has been suggested 12) that in this type of low temperature bainitic microstructures the main strengthening mechanism is intimately related to the very small thickness of the ferrite plates and to its high dislocation density. The former gives the largest contribution, up to 1.6 GPa, while a maximum of 500 MPa is estimated to be provided by the dislocation density.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWhereas strength is mainly provided by to the fine scale of the ferrite plates (stronger phase), ductility is mostly controlled by the retained austenite (softer phase).

In this sense, the desirable situation is that of a mechanically stable austenite, but it has been shown that a too stable austenite is no guarantee for better results. It was also demonstrated that the mechanical stability of the retained austenite present in these microstructures is mainly determined by its chemical composition, or the ability of decreasing M d temperature, rather than its morphology.In any case, the ductility levels achieved, 4.6-29% in total elongation, are extraordinary given the strength levels reported, up to 2.2 GPa.  ) and (b) show optical micrographs of the microstructure obtained at the end of the transformation at 200 C for both alloys.

We assess the biophysical option space for feeding the world in 2050 in a hypothetical zero-deforestation world. We systematically combine realistic assumptions on future yields, agricultural areas, livestock feed and human diets. For each scenario, we determine whether the supply of crop products meets the demand and whether the grazing intensity stays within plausible limits. We find that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without deforestation, even at low crop-yield levels. Within the option space, individual scenarios differ greatly in terms of biomass harvest, cropland demand and grazing intensity, depending primarily on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human diets. Grazing constraints strongly limit the option space. Without the option to encroach into natural or semi-natural land, trade volumes will rise in scenarios with globally converging diets, thereby decreasing the food self-sufficiency of many developing regions. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nGlobal food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDTilman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCBalzer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJHill\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLBefort\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProc.

These findings underpin the insight of other studies that stress the importance of demand-side measures for sustainability 26,27,33,41 . A vegan or vegetarian diet is associated with only half the cropland demand, grazing intensity and overall biomass harvest of comparable meat-based human diets. Furthermore, a decreasing share of livestock products in human diets could also be associated with health benefits, particularly in the industrialized regions 40,42 .However, it is important to note that livestock provides many services other than food, for example, draught power, nutrient management and risk avoidance. For instance, livestock enables the use of land that cannot be used for cropping due to harsh environmental conditions and thus helps broaden society's resource base 33,34,43 . This effect becomes visible in our analysis in scenarios that combine low yields with little cropland expansion.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe global extent of forests is also proposed as an indicator for delineating a safe operating space for humanity, and its significance in the context of sustainability is highlighted 13 .However, safeguarding the existing forests constrains agricultural development as it limits the expansion of cropland and grazing areas. Consequently, the increasing demand for food, feed, fibre and fuel of a growing world population [14][15][16] will have to be met on shrinking per capita land areas. Recent studies suggest that providing sufficient food without cropland expansion is possible 17 , for example, by increasing yields above the current rates 18 , based on higher agricultural inputs and associated with massive trade volumes 19 . In contrast, other studies argue that low-input farming systems, such as organic agriculture, are vital for safeguarding important ecosystem services [20][21][22] . Whether and under which conditions low-input or organic agricultural systems are able to feed the world is fiercely debated 23,24 , warranting further investigation 25 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Combined with their antigen presentation capacity, this powerful functionality enables pDCs to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. pDCs combine features of both lymphocytes and classical dendritic cells and display unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and IFN production. In the decade since the identification of the pDC as a distinct immune cell type, our understanding of its molecular underpinnings and role in immunity has progressed rapidly. Here we review select aspects of pDC biology including cell fate establishment and plasticity, specific molecular mechanisms of pDC function, and the role of pDCs in T cell responses, antiviral immunity, and autoimmune diseases. Important unresolved questions remain in these areas, promising exciting times in pDC research for years to come. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSome of the players are known, including pDCenriched transcription factors Irf8 and SpiB. Both genes represent direct targets of E2-2 (32), although their own binding targets and precise role in pDC development and/or function remain to be established. Others, such as the highly pDC-enriched transcription factor Runx2 (25) and other candidates, must be characterized from scratch. Finally, it should be of interest to elucidate the epigenetic events (e.g., chromatin modifications) that accompany pDC commitment, maintenance, and activation.\nA Novel pDC-Related Dendritic Cell SubsetA simple linear view of E2-2-driven pDC development recently became more complicated, as a novel pDC-related cDC subset in mice was identified using Cx3cr1 as a marker (60). Unlike the classical CD8 + cDCs, the alternative CD8-expressing Cx3cr1 + cDCs develop independently of transcription factor Batf3, do not cross-present antigen, and cannot be expanded by Flt3L.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFurthermore, the isolation of human pDCs based on their specific marker BDCA-2 (an inhibitory receptor) impairs their IFN production capacity. To boost the frustratingly low pDC numbers in mice, many studies inject a Flt3 ligand (Flt3L)-expressing melanoma cell line (40). This approach should be discouraged because the resulting gross tumor and supraphysiological Flt3L levels likely affect pDC ground state and functionality. Another practical consideration involves gene targeting in mice: Some Crerecombinase-expressing deleter strains such as the T cell-specific CD4-Cre strain mediate efficient off-target recombination in pDCs (41). Thus, a careful analysis of recombination in pDCs is required to exclude its potential contribution to the phenotype in conditional targeting experiments.\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF pDCsWe have recently reviewed the developmental origin and transcriptional control of the pDC lineage (6). Here we provide a brief update and highlight several issues that await resolution in future studies. Some of the points discussed below are incorporated into the proposed scheme of pDC development (Figure 1).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, the true life span of peripheral pDCs remains to be established through a combination of approaches. In general, the regulation of pDC survival and quiescence is poorly understood and would provide an interesting topic of future studies.\nMolecular Basis of pDC Lineage CommitmentThe upregulation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (E protein) E2-2 serves as a key lineage commitment event in pDC development, as E2-2-deficient hematopoietic progenitors fail to produce pDCs (32). The exact cellular stage of E2-2 induction is unknown and awaits the analysis of single-cell reporter strains for E2-2 expression. More importantly, the signals for E2-2 induction in pDCs remain obscure and may represent soluble factors, cell-associated ligands, and/or upstream transcription factors. It is noteworthy that E2-2 is expressed at significant levels in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and B lymphocytes; thus, a merely quantitative several-fold upregulation of E2-2 underlies pDC commitment.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[citation 23]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: A census of human transcription factors: Function, expression and evolution \nAbstract: Transcription factors are key cellular components that control gene expression: their activities determine how cells function and respond to the environment. Currently, there is great interest in research into human transcriptional regulation. However, surprisingly little is known about these regulators themselves. For example, how many transcription factors does the human genome contain? How are they expressed in different tissues? Are they evolutionarily conserved? Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation. Much remains to be explored, but this study provides a solid foundation for future investigations to elucidate regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse mammalian biological processes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFinally, we also included 27 curated probable TFs from other sources, such as GO or TRANSFAC 33 ; these TFs contain undefined DNAbinding domains, and were therefore missed using the above procedure.This resulted in a highconfidence data set of 1,391 genomic loci (~6% of the total number of protein coding genes) that encode TFs, which we will focus on for the remainder of this Analysis article, and a further 216 loci representing possible TFs (see Supplementary information S3 (.txt file) for the data set). estimates of the coverage of our approach range from 85% to 94% (Supplementary information S1 (PDF)) suggesting an upper bound of ~1,700-1,900 TFcoding genes in the human genome.Despite the care that we have taken in compiling this data set, there are a few possible sources of inaccura cies. Our method depends heavily on the content of the InterPro database, and the ability of the search algo rithms to detect these domains in protein sequences. The repertoire should be updated when new InterPro entries for newly discovered DNAbinding domains, or refinements of existing ones, and more sensitive search methods become available.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSeveral com putational studies have examined individual mamma lian TF families in detail, but only a few have attempted to identify the full complement of human TFs 29,30 .Some previous studies of TF repertoires -particu larly those in large genomes -may contain misleading predictions for several reasons. Most of these studies depended on identifying genes that are homologous to previously characterized regulators; however, there are technical limitations to sequence search methods, and algorithms can sometimes output false positive hits. Moreover, even among true positives, some DNA binding domains also exist in nonTF proteins, making these domains unreliable markers of sequencespecific DNAbinding functionality. As a result of these difficul ties, we still lack a comprehensive characterization of the human TF repertoire.Here, we overcome some of these difficulties by focusing on a precise definition of sequencespecific DNAbinding regulators, which are among the best defined protein domains. We also minimize prediction errors by manually examining each locus that encodes a potential DNAbinding function. In doing so, we present a comprehensive and highquality census of TFs in the human genome.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition, we build on previous findings of diseasecausing regulators: large numbers of TFs that we do not detect in normal tissues become highly expressed in diseased conditions.Of course, the observations discussed here constitute only a first attempt to describe these regulators, and there are important caveats that should be considered when using the data. The SymAtlas data set is restricted by the fact that not all TFs are represented on the arrays used in this study; this means that we were unable to assess the expression of more than 500 TFs. Nonetheless, as the existing data covers twothirds of TFs, we expect our findings to be robust. The repertoire itself also has weak nesses: at present, we include all genes encoding C 2 H 2 zincfingers, as they are a major group of regulators; however, a major future challenge will be to distinguish between proteins that bind DNA from those that prima rily complex with RNA. We will overcome many of these limitations as new data types become available. Indeed, transcriptomic data derived from highthroughput sequencing methods, such as RNASeq, will yield pre cise expression levels for every TF, as the method does not depend on array design.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many of the structural matrix materials that are currently utilized at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, such as solution deposited, high-k dielectrics and commercial photoresists, exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the 8\u201312 \u03bcm spectral range which represents a significant challenge to developing transmissive, three-dimensional (3D) metamaterials operating in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectral region. In this paper, we present new, low loss photopatternable polymer dielectrics as well-suited matrix materials for fabricating LWIR-metamaterials. These materials are synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees followed by a thiol-ene coupling reaction to cross-link the remaining olefin groups. After cross-linking, the olefin LWIR-absorption band is minimized and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the material increases. Thick layers of the polymer (>3 \u03bcm), which acts as a negative photoresist, can be deposited easily using a spin coating technique to develop planarizing layers with photopatternable vias. A demonstration on the low loss nature of the polymer dielectrics was carried out by incorporating the polymer into an all-dielectric, infrared metamaterial. Thus, the material is ideal for both lithography and fabrication of 3D metamaterial structures operating in the LWIR spectral region. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, the ideal dielectric matrix material for LWIRmetamaterial applications would be simultaneously low-loss, low-index, and allow for solution deposition for simple planarization. Low loss photopatternable polymer dielectics appear to be a promising solution. However, off-the-shelf commerically available photoresist polymers also exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the optical regime. 27 An ideal polymer dielectric would have losses comparable to polyethylene but have the additional benefits of a resist in that it is compatible with 3D fabrication techniques, photopatternable, and high temperature process tolerant. 28 We have identified a route to a tunable matrix material which satisfies each of these requirements in the thermal infrared spectral region (8-12 mm). 29,30 The materials are synthesized using the ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene followed by a partial hydrogenation to remove most of the IR absorbing olefin groups in the 8-12 mm range (Scheme 1). Photopatterning of these materials can then be achieved using the remaining olefin groups via a thiol-ene coupling reaction.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMany of the structural matrix materials that are currently utilized at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, such as solution deposited, high-k dielectrics and commercial photoresists, exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the 8-12 mm spectral range which represents a significant challenge to developing transmissive, threedimensional (3D) metamaterials operating in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectral region.

This aphotic ecosystem is anoxic and consists of a slightly acidic (pH 6.2) sodium chloride-dominated brine. Expeditions in 2005 and 2010 were conducted to investigate the biogeochemistry of Lake Vida\u2019s brine system. A phylogenetically diverse and metabolically active Bacteria dominated microbial assemblage was observed in the brine. These bacteria live under very high levels of reduced metals, ammonia, molecular hydrogen (H2), and dissolved organic carbon, as well as high concentrations of oxidized species of nitrogen (i.e., supersaturated nitrous oxide and \u223c1 mmol\u22c5L\u22121 nitrate) and sulfur (as sulfate). The existence of this system, with active biota, and a suite of reduced as well as oxidized compounds, is unusual given the millennial scale of its isolation from external sources of energy. The geochemistry of the brine suggests that abiotic brine-rock reactions may occur in this system and that the rich sources of dissolved electron acceptors prevent sulfate reduction and methanogenesis from being energetically favorable. The discovery of this ecosystem and the in situ biotic and abiotic processes occurring at low temperature provides a tractable system to study habitability of isolated terrestrial cryoenvironments (e.g., permafrost cryopegs and subglacial ecosystems), and is a potential analog for habitats on other icy worlds where water-rock reactions may cooccur with saline deposits and subsurface oceans. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMicrobial communities in these conditions are often sustained by a supply of energy that ultimately derives from photosynthesis (present or past). The understanding of ecosystems based on energy sources other than the Sun comes mainly from realms where hydrothermal processes have provided reduced compounds necessary to fuel chemosynthetically driven ecosystems. Methane derived from thermogenic or biogenic sources can also support microbial communities in deep sea (7) and high arctic cold saline seeps (8). More recently, discoveries of life and associated processes in deep terrestrial subsurface ecosystems (9) provide compelling evidence of subsurface life that in some cases is fueled by nonphotosynthetic processes. Our knowledge of geochemical and microbial processes in aphotic icy environments remains mostly unknown, however, especially at subzero temperatures.Lake Vida is located in Victoria Valley, the northern most of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica (Fig. S1). Initial studies of Lake Vida's thick ice cover described a -11.6 \u00b0C, wet, saline (estimated 245, practical salinity scale) ice at 15.8 m (10).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis brine has been isolated by the thick lake ice cover and underlying 800-970 m of permafrost (11,12), prohibiting input of ground water or of annual glacial melt and associated nutrients. 14 C-dating of organic matter sampled at 12 m in the lake ice cover suggests that the brine has been isolated for more than 2,800 y (10). The Lake Vida brine represents a cryoecosystem that is a suitable, accessible analog for glacial and subglacial systems, including soils, sediments, wetlands, and lakes underlying the Antarctic ice sheet, some of which may harbor saline waters at depth (13), and for the icy worlds of our solar system. The goal of the present study is to examine the inorganic and organic geochemistry as well as the biology of the brine and determine the capacity of this sealed, aphotic cryoecosystem for harboring and sustaining microbial life.\nResults and DiscussionDuring coring of the lake ice in 2005, brine infiltrated the borehole 16.0 m below the surface of the ice.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nInternational Uni- versity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t33181.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNorth Miami\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFL\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMicrobial life at -13 \u00b0C in the brine of an ice-sealed Antarctic lake\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5481C042BDF0C37C495CD395C0CD37E2\n\t\t\t\t\t10.1073/pnas.1208607109\n\t\t\t\t\tand approved October 19, 2012 (received for review May 22, 2012\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nThe permanent ice cover of Lake Vida (Antarctica) encapsulates an extreme cryogenic brine ecosystem (-13 \u00b0C; salinity, 200).

[citation 17].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Controlling fast transport of cold trapped ions \nAbstract: We realize fast transport of ions in a segmented microstructured Paul trap. The ion is shuttled over a distance of more than 10(4) times its ground state wave function size during only five motional cycles of the trap (280 \u03bcm in 3.6 \u03bcs). Starting from a ground-state-cooled ion, we find an optimized transport such that the energy increase is as low as 0.10\u00b10.01 motional quanta. In addition, we demonstrate that quantum information stored in a spin-motion entangled state is preserved throughout the transport. Shuttling operations are concatenated, as a proof-of-principle for the shuttling-based architecture to scalable ion trap quantum computing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSo far, ion shuttling in a multiplexed trap has been demonstrated together with additional sympathetic cooling [7], and in the adiabatic regime, where the transient displacement of the ion is smaller than the size of the its wavepacket [8,9]. Transport of neutral atoms have also been performed using magnetic [10] or optical [11] techniques.Because quantum gate operations require ions close to the motional ground state and fast transport inherently creates motional excitation, the challenge is to develop transport protocols that guarantee sufficiency small energy transfer. In this work we demonstrate shuttling operations that are highly non-adiabatic while the final state of the ion is close to the motional groundstate. We also show that quantum information stored in both the motional and the spin degree of freedom is preserved through the shuttling.During a shuttling operation, the ion motion in the harmonic trapping potential is excited when the acceleration is sufficiently strong. This motional excitation is a harmonic oscillation, characterized by a well defined phase, thus allowing it to be canceled out by proper management of the forces involved during or after the transport. We experimentally demonstrate two methods of canceling the acquired motional excitation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe experimentally demonstrate two methods of canceling the acquired motional excitation. One method uses two shuttles, where the transport to the destination generates the same net momentum transfer as the transport back, but is applied 180 \u2022 out of phase with respect to the secular oscillation of the ion (Fig. 1b). We refer to this as the pairwise energy-neutral transport. For the second scheme, the self-neutral transport we apply a sharp counter-\"kick\" to the ion at the end of a single transport operation, stopping its motion (Fig. 1c). This case of single-sided transport allows even faster shuttling and can be sequentially repeated since it is energy selfneutral, making it the preferred building block for scalable quantum information protocols.The experiments are carried out in a micro-structured segmented Paul trap [12], where the trapping voltage applied to each electrode segment is controlled by an FPGA-based arbitrary waveform generator that allows high resolution for both timing and voltage, while having low noise ( 10nV/ \u221a Hz at the trap frequency). Further noise reduction at high frequencies is done with a \u03a0-type filter having a cut-off frequency of 300 kHz.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAfter this procedure, the probing is repeated and we find that the trap frequency deviations are reduced by two orders of magnitude, down to the measurement precision of 390 Hz, using a dwell time of 100 \u00b5s. This corresponds to less than one per mille of the trap frequency, as shown in Fig. 4c. It is interesting to consider that the quantum information stored in a coherent superposition of two Fock states, even though being displaced by more than 100 phonons during the transport, can be fully retrieved.We have demonstrated fast shuttling operations with small residual motional excitation, such that the ion ends the transport near the motional groundstate. We also showed that qubit information is preserved through the shuttling by transporting a spin-motion entangled state with negligible loss of coherence. As a next step we intend to perform fast splitting operations of multi-ion crystals. Our long-term goal is to extend the transport scheme to parallel operations on multiple segments and combine it with laser-driven quantum logic gates.

Therefore, specific crystallographic symmetries or lattice parameters can only be achieved using specific nanoparticles as building blocks (and vice versa). We present six design rules that can be used to deliberately prepare nine distinct colloidal crystal structures, with control over lattice parameters on the 25- to 150-nanometer length scale. These design rules outline a strategy to independently adjust each of the relevant crystallographic parameters, including particle size (5 to 60 nanometers), periodicity, and interparticle distance. As such, this work represents an advance in synthesizing tailorable macroscale architectures comprising nanoscale materials in a predictable fashion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBecause each of the SNA-NPs used to assemble these superlattices is functionalized with a large number of DNA strands, it is possible to put multiple DNA sequences on a single nanoparticle.Therefore, the fifth rule of DNA-programmed assembly is: SNA-NPs can be functionalized with more than one oligonucleotide bonding element, providing access to crystal structures not possible with single element SNA-NPs.For example, a SNA-NP that is functionalized with linkers containing self-complementary sticky ends would be predicted to form an fcc lattice as its thermodynamic product, as per rule 1. However, if this SNA-NP were also functionalized with a second type of DNA linker that contained a sticky end complementary to the sticky ends of a different SNA-NP, additional DNA linkages could be created. This enables the synthesis of NaCl-type lattices, where the self-complementary sticky ends dictate the formation of an fcc lattice, but the additional sticky ends allow a second nanoparticle to fill into the octahedral holes in the fcc lattice while it forms (Fig. 7).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis allows one to separately control the radius of an inorganic nanoparticle and the overall hydrodynamic radius of an SNA-NP.Therefore, the second rule of DNA-programmed nanoparticle assembly is:The overall hydrodynamic radius of a SNA-NP, rather than the sizes of its individual NP or oligonucleotide components, dictates its assembly and packing behavior.In other words, two nanoparticles can be made to behave as if they were exactly the same size, even if they possess inorganic nanoparticle cores of widely different diameters; this is achieved by altering the DNA linker lengths on the two particles so that the sums of the DNA length and nanoparticle core are equivalent (Fig. 4). This enables the synthesis of CsCl-type lattices, which exhibit the same connectivity as bcc lattices, but utilize particles of with different inorganic cores. Interestingly, appropriate choice of DNA linker lengths allows for two particles to have the same hydrodynamic radius (and therefore same assembly behavior) even if one particle has an inorganic core that is three times the size of the other.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe third rule for DNA-programmed assembly is: In a binary system based upon complementary SNA-NPs, favored products will tend to have equivalent numbers of each complementary DNA sequence, evenly spaced throughout a unit cell.In order to achieve more complex crystallographic symmetries, DNA and nanoparticle combinations must be used where, unlike the fcc, bcc, and CsCl lattices mentioned previously, nanoparticle assembly behavior is not equivalent for the two particles in a binary system. This is most readily achieved by changing the ratio of the hydrodynamic sizes of the particles, or by changing the relative number of DNA strands on each particle. The size ratio affects the packing of the SNA-NPs by controlling where particles are positioned relative to one another. For example, a particle with a large hydrodynamic radius can be surrounded by a large number of particles with a relatively small hydrodynamic radius, but each small particle can only be surrounding by a few larger particles; one would therefore predict that the most favored unit cell for this pairing would have a particle stoichiometry that favors the presence of a larger number of the smaller particles. The ratio of the number of DNA strands on each particle type has a different, but equally important effect.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show that this new version preserves the accuracy of the original algorithm while allowing for higher throughput. We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSingleparticle electron cryo-microscopy: towards atomic resolution\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVan Heel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBGowen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMatadeen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEVOrlova\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRFinn\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTPape\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDCohen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHStark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSchmidt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSchatz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPatwardhan A\n\t\t\n\t\t11233408\n\t\n\t\n\t\tQuarterly reviews of biophysics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVan Heel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGHarauz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEVOrlova\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSchmidt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSchatz\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1006/jsbi.1996.0004\n\t\t8742718\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of structural biology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t116\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1996\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAutomated determination of parameters describing power spectra of micrograph images in electron microscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZHuang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPRBaldwin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSMullapudi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPAPenczek\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.jsb.2003.10.011\n\t\t14643211\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Structural Biology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t144\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2003\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tACE: automated CTF estimation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPMallick\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBCarragher\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCSPotter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDJKriegman\n\t\t\n\t\t15935913\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUltramicroscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\t104\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2005\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA Primer to Single-Particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYCheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNGrigorieff\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPPenczek\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWalz\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.050\n\t\t25910204\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t161\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVolta potential phase plate for infocus phase contrast transmission electron microscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRDanev\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBBuijsse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMKhoshouei\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMPlitzko\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWBaumeister\n\t\t\n\t\tpnas.1418377111\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t1073\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDetermination of astigmatism in TEM images\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKVFernando\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSDFuller\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ StructBiol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t157\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Among the four vulture species breeding in the western Palaearctic, the species showing the steepest population decline, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, is a long-distance migrant wintering in Africa. However, the flyways and wintering areas of the species are only known for some populations, and without knowledge of where mortality occurs, effective conservation management is not possible. We tracked 19 juvenile Egyptian Vultures from the declining breeding population on the Balkan Peninsula between 2010 and 2014 to estimate survival and identify important migratory routes and wintering areas for this species. Mortality during the first autumn migration was high (monthly survival probability 0.75) but mortality during migration was exclusively associated with suboptimal navigation. All birds from western breeding areas and three birds from central and eastern breeding areas attempted to fly south over the Mediterranean Sea, but only one in 10 birds survived this route, probably due to stronger tailwind. All eight birds using the migratory route via Turkey and the Middle East successfully completed their first autumn migration. Of 14 individual and environmental variables examined to explain why juvenile birds did or did not successfully complete their first migration, the natal origin of the bird was the most influential. We speculate that in a declining population with fewer experienced adults, an increasing proportion of juvenile birds are forced to migrate without conspecific guidance, leading to high mortality as a consequence of following sub-optimal migratory routes. Juvenile Egyptian Vultures wintered across a vast range of the Sahel and eastern Africa, and had large movement ranges with core use areas at intermediate elevations in savannah, cropland or desert. Two birds were shot in Africa, where several significant threats exist for vultures at continental scales. Given the broad distribution of the birds and threats, effective conservation in Africa will be challenging and will require long-term investment. We recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWintering home-ranges were based on 50% kernel utilization distributions, and movement ranges were based on 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP). Relative variable importance was calculated using a permutation procedure based on a random forest model classifying locations as core range locations. GPP: general primary productivity. birds from more western breeding areas would require an initial departure towards a non-intuitive northeasterly direction to migrate around the northern coast of the Aegean Sea. Such a detour might be facilitated by following experienced birds, as has been suggested for other soaring migrants detouring around the Mediterranean (Mellone et al. 2011, Panuccio et al. 2012).Although there is no evidence that social facilitation or reliance on experienced migrants is a crucial element for successful migration of juvenile Egyptian Vultures, several migration patterns that can be observed in the region are consistent with the proposition that juveniles may benefit from following adult birds along a flyway through continental Turkey. First, adult and juvenile migration phenology matches temporally, with a peak for both age groups between 8 and 24 September in southern Turkey (Sutherland & Brooks 1981, Oppel et al. 2014).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe difficulty in finding experienced migrants may force inexperienced juveniles to follow their migratory instincts to reach Africa by heading in a southerly direction, as has been found in other soaring migrants (Chernetsov et al. 2004). Such a strategy is riskier for birds from western breeding areas, where the shortest route will lead the birds either via the Peloponnese or via islands in the Aegean Sea across a > 250-km stretch of open water to the coast of northern Africa, an exceptional strategy for a large raptor that may only be viable in very favourable wind conditions (Bildstein 2006, Agostini et al. 2015). In contrast, birds from more eastern breeding populations reach Turkey via the Bosphorus or the Dardanelles when heading in a southerly direction. To avoid the hazardous route over the Mediterranean, the Table 4. Mean proportion of habitat types and environmental variables at winter locations within the core 50% utilization distribution, compared with locations within winter movement ranges of wintering juvenile Egyptian Vultures in Africa.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nyears, however, there has been increasing awareness that events during migration or on wintering grounds can affect populations of migratory animals (Newton 2004, Studds & Marra 2005, Both et al. 2006). Identifying migration routes, stopover areas and wintering areas for migratory species that are declining is therefore necessary for designing effective conservation strategies that can address threats operating outside breeding areas (Wilcove & Wikelski 2008).The decline of long-distance migrants has been most apparent for passerines and smaller-bodied birds but there is evidence that long-distance migratory raptors are also declining (Hoffman & Smith 2003). Among the four vulture species that breed in the western Palaearctic, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is the only longdistance migrant that travels to wintering regions in sub-Saharan Africa (Porter & Beaman 1985, Meyburg et al. 2004, Garc \u0131a-Ripoll es et al. 2010).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample at limiting dilution followed by PCR amplification and endpoint detection to identify the presence or absence of template molecules in each reaction. All performance metrics of digital PCR, including sensitivity, precision and dynamic range, improve with the total number of digital reactions performed. Assuming a random distribution of single molecules and reliable detection of single molecules, it may be shown that the expected response, precision, and dynamic range of digital PCR are respectively given by ( 1), ( 2) and ( 3):(1)( ) 2 1 2 1 1 1 6 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe next evaluated the precision of our device in detecting small allelic imbalances by measuring the relative copy number of the HLCS and RPPH1 genes in normal human genomic DNA spiked with varying amounts of trisomy 21 (T21) genomic DNA ranging from 6% to 2%. Reliable discrimination of 2% and 3% enrichment was obtained reproducibly using sub-arrays of 100,000 chambers, while 1% enrichment was only well-resolved using full 1,000,000 chamber arrays.\nCONCLUSIONIn addition to enabling new measurements in biomedical research and diagnostics, the high assay density in our device has important implications for the adoption of digital PCR as a routine analytical tool. Thus, we contend that megapixel digital PCR or similar high-density formats will ultimately replace real-time qPCR as the standard analytical tool for absolute DNA measurement.Figure 1 :1Figure 1: (a) Schematic of megapixel digital PCR device, with insets showing the array and chamber geometries.

In particular, the remarkable device efficiency is strongly influenced by the perovskite crystallinity and the film morphology. Here, we investigate the perovskites crystallisation kinetics and growth mechanism in real time from liquid precursor continually to the final uniform film. We utilize some advanced in situ characterisation techniques including synchrotron-based grazing incident X-ray diffraction to observe crystal structure and chemical transition of perovskites. The nano-assemble model from perovskite intermediated [PbI6]4- cage nanoparticles to bulk polycrystals is proposed to understand perovskites formation at a molecular- or nano-level. A crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic crystallisation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these in situ dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation and transformation from the molecular to the microstructure over relevant temperature and time scales is successfully demonstrated. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe 60 \u00b0C-processed thin film with smaller size droplets were still not continuous. At 80 \u00b0C, the film showed slightly enlarged droplets, many of which merged together to form larger domains. When the heating temperature was increased to 100 \u00b0C, a highly regular, banded topography with a period of B2 mm was seen (Supplementary Figs 10 and11). The height variation of this periodic structure at the surface, that is, the amplitude, was B200 nm (Supplementary Fig. 10). At the centre of these banded structures, a plateau consisting of nanoscopic crystallites was also observed. These structures are very much akin to spherlitic textures seen in semi-crystalline polymers and metals [35][36][37] , where a radial growth of crystals emanates from a nucleus, and as the crystals grow outward, the growth fronts impinge on each other, arresting the crystallisation, forming the polygonal textures. The sizes and shapes of the polygonal structures are dictated by the areal density of nucleation 35 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBased on these dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation from molecular to microstructure is successfully demonstrated.\nResultsPerovskites crystallisation and structure transformation. All GIXD measurements were performed on beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Sources of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with critical methods to obtain the perovskites structure formation and crystal growth in real time. To in situ monitor the whole evolution process at the very beginning with the precursor solution, a compatible mini-slot-die printer 20 was integrated with on-line GIXD, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. For the traditional spincoating technique 21 , most of the deposition solution is ejected during rotation and the subsequent thermal annealing process begins with the intermediated complex film, hindering the capture of the whole crystallisation process. The in situ printing experiment was conducted in the helium atmosphere to reduce the air scattering. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 M lead acetate (Pb(Ac) 2 ) and 1.2 M methylammonium iodide (MAI) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEnhance understanding of rhythmic crystallization in confined evaporating polymer solution films: from environment to solution film and then to one period\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQGu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXWu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRSC Adv\n\t\t\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2016\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRhythmic growth-induced ring-banded spherulites with radial periodic variation of thicknesses grown from poly(e-caprolactone) solution with constant concentration\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGCAlfonso\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZHu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTHe\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMacromolecules\n\t\t\n\t\t\t41\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2008\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHigh-performance inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells based on lead acetate precursor with efficiency exceeding 18%\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLZhao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAdv.

Imaging of fluorescent proteins (FPs) using red excitation light in the 'optical window' above 600 nm is one potential method for visualizing implanted cells. However, previous efforts to engineer FPs with peak excitation beyond 600 nm have resulted in undesirable reductions in brightness. Here we report three new red-excitable monomeric FPs obtained by structure-guided mutagenesis of mNeptune. Two of these, mNeptune2 and mNeptune2.5, demonstrate improved maturation and brighter fluorescence than mNeptune, whereas the third, mCardinal, has a red-shifted excitation spectrum without reduction in brightness. We show that mCardinal can be used to non-invasively and longitudinally visualize the differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes in living mice with high anatomical detail. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe purified and digested PCR products were ligated into similarly digested pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-N1 cloning vectors to create pmCardinal-C1 and pmCardinal-N1.

Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Ni\u00f1o years record larger than average atmospheric CO2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric CO2 and climate change. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTerrestrial models also investigated the effect of CO 2 and climate, always agreeing on the positive response of land carbon storage to atmospheric CO 2 increase (the so-called fertilization effect), but not reaching consensus on the terrestrial ecosystem response to the associated climate change. Some earlier studies found an enhanced terrestrial productivity [31] while later studies found the opposite [32,33]. The third assessment report of IPCC concluded that, by mid-twenty-first century, climate change would reduce the land carbon uptake by 21% to 43% and the ocean carbon uptake by 6% to 25%, relative to CO 2 only driven uptakes [34]. This IPCC range was very conservative, as further discussed below.Nevertheless, all these studies gave a clear signal to the climate modelling community: one cannot simulate future climate change assuming atmospheric CO 2 can be known, a priori, from the CO 2 emissions trajectory. The evolution of atmospheric CO 2 results from the balance between the CO 2 emissions and the land and ocean carbon sinks, these last ones being a complex function of atmospheric CO 2 and climate.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSecond, nitrogen also reduces the carbon loss due to climate change; as soil warming leads to increased nitrogen mineralization, hence increasing nitrogen availability to the plant [41,42].The Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group I of the IPCC AR5 headlined that 'Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO 2 in the atmosphere (high confidence)'. More specifically, it stated 'Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that the feedback between climate and the carbon cycle is positive in the 21st century; that is, climate change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO 2 . As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO 2 will remain in the atmosphere. A positive feedback between climate and the carbon cycle on century to millennial timescales is supported by palaeoclimate observations and modelling.'\nObservational constraintsClearly, models alone are not helping to constrain the carbon cycle feedbacks; observations are needed to reduce uncertainties. However, there is a fundamental issue when trying to constrain feedbacks from observations.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAlthough they cannot directly constrain the carbon cycle sensitivities, they can help evaluate to ability of models to simulate the mean state of the system, such as gross fluxes and reservoirs.Finally, there are numerous other biological processes that can be affected by climate change, and potentially induce a feedback on the human induced warming, such as N 2 O emissions, isoprene and ozone chemistry, fires and aerosols emissions. A recent review of these candidates showed a very low confidence in their estimate as often based on very few studies, but fail to find large potential feedbacks others than the ones already discussed here [64].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show that the singularity corrections for treating these divergencies depend only on the total number and the positions of k points and on the lattice vectors, in particular, the unit cell volume, but not on the particular positions of atoms within the unit cell. The method proposed here to treat the singularities constitutes a stable, simple to implement, and general scheme that can be applied to systems with arbitrary lattice parameters within either the EXX Kohn-Sham or the HF formalism. We apply the singularity correction to a typical symmetric structure, diamond, and to a more general structure, trans-polyacetylene. We consider the effect of the singularity corrections on volume optimizations and k-point convergence. While the singularity correction clearly depends on the total number of k points, it exhibits a remarkably small dependence upon the choice of the specific arrangement of the k points. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nASorouri\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWM CFoulkes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tND MHine\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

RESULTS FOR DIAMOND AND TRANS -POLYACETYLENEThe applicability of the presented approach for treating the divergencies is now demonstrated by applying it to two cases, diamond and trans-polyacetylene, using different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals: the Slater-Dirac (exchange-only LDA) referred to as Dirac exchange in the following, the complete exchange-correlation LDA in the parametrisation of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN), 8 the combination of Dirac exchange plus Perdew86 9 (P86) correlation (P86 being VWN correlation plus a gradient correction), the EXX (exact-exchange only), and finally the combination of EXX with P86 correlation.The pseudopotentials were generated using the pseudopotential generation code of Engel, 26 which is based on the Troullier-Martins norm-conserving scheme. 27 In all cases the pseudopotentials were generated using consistently the same functionals for exchange and correlation as for the plane wave calculations. Relativistic effect are not included. The pseudopotentials of C are all constructed using a cutoff radius of 1.3 a.u.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The resulting fusion gene products have attracted considerable interest as diagnostic and promising therapeutic targets. So far, oncogenic FET fusion proteins have been regarded as strong transcription factors that aberrantly activate or repress target genes of their DNA-binding fusion partners. However, the role of the transactivating domain in the context of the normal FET proteins is poorly defined, and, therefore, our knowledge on how FET aberrations impact on tumor biology is incomplete. Since we believe that a full understanding of aberrant FET protein function can only arise from looking at both sides of the coin, the good and the evil, this paper summarizes evidence for the central function of FET proteins in bridging RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFUS has been demonstrated to bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs [15]. EWS might have similar sequence specificity since it was demonstrated to bind strongly to both poly G and poly U, but not to poly A and poly C RNA, homopolymers [16]. Although it is only the zinc finger domain of FUS that makes physical contact with the GGUG motif, all three RGG boxes together with the RRM contribute to this activity [15]. Intriguingly, a recent study identified strong binding of FUS to human telomeric RNA [17] and to small low-copy-number RNAs tethered to the promoter of cyclin D1 [18]. Nothing is known about the RNA binding specificity TAF15.\nA Role for FETProteins in RNA Transcription. The FET N-terminal domain (NTD) resembles the activation domain of certain transcription factors such as SP-1 rich in glutamine and proline residues. When fused to a DNA-binding domain (DBD), as is the case in oncogenic FET derivatives, the NTD strongly activates reporter gene activity in a DNA-bindingdependent way [19][20][21][22][23].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe recently discovered homologous DNA-strand-pairing activity of all four FET proteins may functionally contribute to this role [77].Intriguingly, the RNA binding activity of FUS was reported to act as a sensor for DNA damage and to elicit transcriptional repression; as exemplified for cyclin D (CCND1) promoter regulation, DNA damage was demonstrated to induce the expression of single-stranded, low-copy-number ncRNA transcripts tethered to the 5 regulatory regions of CCND1 which recruit FUS and allosterically modify it to bind to and repress CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities [18].Activation of gene transcription by many, if not all, sequence-specific transcription factors requires DNAtopoisomerase-II-beta-dependent, transient, site-specific dsDNA break formation [78]. One may speculate that the proposed role of FET proteins in recombination repair is linked to their association with transcription initiation complexes at promoter regions.

Comparison with earlier work on noncrystalline solids shows that they all have the same conductivity within a factor of 5 over the entire temperature range investigated, with the same characteristic plateau around 10 \u00b0K, and that their conductivity varies as Tn, n\u223c1.8, below T = 1 \u00b0K. Furthermore, the average phonon mean free path is large by comparison with the phonon wavelength, about 10\u22124 cm at 2 \u00b0K and decreasing as T\u22124 at larger T, suggesting a Rayleigh-type scattering mechanism. Such a mean free path can be quantitatively explained by approximating the glassy structure with that of a crystal in which every atom is displaced from its lattice site. Then every atom scatters like an interstitial atom, or\u2014even simpler\u2014like one that is missing at its regular lattice site, with a scattering cross section determined by the missing mass (isotopic defect). The specific heat of amorphous SiO2, GeO2, and Se has been found to vary as AT+BT3 between 0.1 and 1 \u00b0K, with A = 10 erg/g\u00b0K2 within a factor of 2. This departure from the Debye specific heat may be characteristic of the glassy state, as all earlier measurements of other glasses [polystyrene, glycerol, Lucite (PMMA)] indicate a similar anomaly. Its origin is not clear. Impurities or surface effects through adsorbed gases are unlikely because of the many samples and experimental techniques used in different laboratories. We have tried to attribute the anomaly to low-lying electronic states, motional states of ions, trapped atoms or large groups of atoms, or one-dimensional vibrations within a three-dimensional solid, so far without success. At the present time, the only independent evidence for these excitations appears to be in the low-temperature thermal conductivity at T < 1 \u00b0K described above. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nE.

INTRODUCTIONThe thermal conductivity of noncrystalline dielectric solids differs markedly from that of crystalline ones. ' As an example, Fig. 1 shows the conductivities of crystalline and vitreous silicon dioxide. In crystals, the conductivity increases with decreasing temperature because the anhar- monic umklapp processes become less frequent, and hence the phonon mean free path increases. Eventually, the mean free path becomes comparable to the sample dimensions, and the conductivity goes through a maximum and then decreases as the specific heat decreases.The conductivity of crystals depends very much on the material, and in ad- dition any disturbance of the lattice periodicity lowers the conductivity in a sometimes very characteristic way, as shown in Fig. 1, for example.In noncrystalline solids, the conductivity is several orders of magnitude smaller than in crystals, it decreases monotonically with decreasing tempera- ture, and furthermore it is independent of the chem- ical composition: In Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n(c) To show that the specific heat of noncrystal- line solids below 1 'K does not follow the expected Debye T law, but instead approaches a linear variation with temperature. This striking behavior seems to be characteristic for noncrystalline solids, and to be independent of accidental impurities.This anomaly may also be responsible for the thermal conductivity below 1 'K. Its origin is yet un- known.r=C\"md yZ,(2)200where C\"m and E are the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the sample, respectively, and d is a characteristic length, typically a diameter of the sample.For the noncrystalline samples used in this investigation, this v was less than 0. 1 sec at the lowest temperatures, and increased to approx- imately 1 sec at 1 K. For the crystals, v was even shorter. The largest source of error was random building vibrations transmitted to the sample, causing random temperature fluctuations and hence uncertainties in the determination of the sample temperature while the sample temperature returned to that of the bath following a heat pulse.These fluctuations caused a maximum error of 20% in the specific heat below 0.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3 The complete lack of sensitivity to composition in the noncrystalline solids would be understandable if the conductivity were as low as it could possibly be, corresponding to a diffusion of the vibrational en- ergy from one atom to the neighboring ones. But this is not the case. A crystal containing as few as 0. 1% of foreign ions can have a conductivity lower than that of the glasses (see Fig. nant lattice vibrations or 10 intermolecular spacings. Qnly Rt the highest temperatures, where glasses Rnd crystals have approximately equal conduetivities, is l of the order of the intermolecular spacing, i. e. , 10 7 em. 2' We will return to this point later in Fig. 9. Consequently, the problem has to be stated as follows: Why do all noncrystalline solids have the same (high) conductivity at low temperatures, and why do Rll the curves have the same characteristic shape with a plateau in the neighbor- hood of 10 'K'P This question was the starting point for the present investigation.Two models have been suggested to explain the conductivity of glasses.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n98. If one considers the large average binding energy of 82.0 kcal/mol, the DFT-D3 results can be regarded as mostly very accurate and an MAD value of about 2 kcal/mol for PW6B95 is close to the accuracy of the reference values \u0351and to remaining basis set incompleteness effects\u0352. For all 11 DFs the average MAD decreases from 7.8 \u0351DFT\u0352 to 5.2 \u0351DFT-D2\u0352 and 4.3 kcal/mol for DFT-D3. Only for PBE and PBE0 which have a clear overbinding tendency already without any correction, \u0351both\u0352 versions worsen the results.

All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAll of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust 3,4 . Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors 5-8 , the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers [9][10][11] . An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods 12 . Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks 13,14 . Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nConducting polymer dough for deformable electronics\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJYOh\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAdv.

Our increasing population size and per capita impacts are severely testing the ability of Earth to provide for peoples' most basic needs. Awareness of these circumstances has grown tremendously, as has the sophistication of efforts to address them. But the complexity of the challenge remains daunting. We explore prospects for transformative change in three critical areas of sustainable development: achieving a sustainable population size and securing vital natural capital, both in part through reducing inequity, and strengthening the societal leadership of academia. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n3). EFCAs are being zoned so as to focus conservation and restoration in places with high return on investment for public benefit; at the same time, high-impact human activities are being zoned to sustain or enhance natural capital values.These initiatives have dual goals: to harmonize people and nature by securing critical natural capital, and to alleviate poverty. Specifically, the government aims to protect ecosystems and their biodiversity for flood control, hydropower production efficiency, irrigation supply, more productive agriculture and tourism. In addition, it aims to open non-farm sectors, increase household income and make land-use practices more sustainable in rural areas 70 . Although these initiatives represent a massive scientific and policy undertaking, there is still little understanding of the local costs of implementation, or their effects on poor and vulnerable populations in or near the target areas. The EFCA model represents a new paradigm for integrating conservation and human development, but for this policy innovation to have wide applicability, it will be important to assess and improve local livelihoods 71 .\nGender and gender equity in sustainabilityAs evidence for the value of community-based resource management has accumulated 72 , a special role for women in environmental sustainability has begun to emerge.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nneeds, goals and desired futures, for example see ref.97. The embedding of environmental concerns into public discourse and policy less than a quarter of a century after 1960 is in itself a fine example of the speed with which cultural change towards sustainability can occur. Now we need to see if we can go much further, in far less time.\nFigure 3 |3Figure 3 | China's new system of EFCAs. As delineated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007, EFCAs span 24% of China's land area and 25% (708) of its counties. EFCAs are designed to secure biodiversity, soils and water resources, and to mitigate floods and prevent sandstorms. The implementation of EFCAs also serves a major social goal of alleviating poverty. Figure is a modified version of a map provided courtesy of Z.

Collectively, they represent a promising shift towards a more inclusive, integrated and effective set of strategies [64][65][66] . Taken together, these efforts span the globe and target a full suite of ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water supply, flood control, coastal protection and enhancement of scenic beauty (and associated recreation/ tourism values) 67,68 .The ecosystem service investments being made in China today stand out in their ambitious goals, scale and duration. Prompted by massive droughts and flooding in 1997-1998, China implemented several national forestry and conservation initiatives to address the nation's growing environmental crises, involving approximately 120 million households and investing approximately 700 billion yuan over 2000-2010 69 . China is currently also undertaking a first national assessment of ecosystem services, spanning a wide range of ecosystems, services and scales. Perhaps most ambitiously, China is establishing a new network of 'ecosystem function conservation areas' (EFCAs; Fig. 3).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Obstacles blocking wider adoption of FIB-SEM include slow imaging speed and lack of long-term system stability, which caps the maximum possible acquisition volume. Here, we present techniques that accelerate image acquisition while greatly improving FIB-SEM reliability, allowing the system to operate for months and generating continuously imaged volumes > 106 \u00b5m3. These volumes are large enough for connectomics, where the excellent z resolution can help in tracing of small neuronal processes and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming human proofreading effort. Even higher resolution can be achieved on smaller volumes. We present example data sets from mammalian neural tissue, Drosophila brain, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to illustrate the power of this novel high-resolution technique to address questions in both connectomics and cell biology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe probe current was set at ~4 nA and working distance at ~3 mm with imaging speed of 4 MHz. The x-y pixel size was 8 nm for both systems unless noted. SEM images were acquired for every 2 nm of material removal. After the final image series were registered using IMOD (Kremer et al., 1996) or SIFT plug-in of Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012), every four consecutive images were binned down to one, forming an image stack with isotropic voxels of 8 \u00c2 8 \u00c2 8 nm 3 . The gallium FIB column was operated at 30 keV. A 7-nA probe current was selected for milling with the FEI Magnum column, while a 13-or 27-nA probe current was used in a Zeiss NVision40. A repeated line scan of 0.1 mm pixel and 1-MHz frequency was applied. A 10 Hz PID closed-loop algorithm written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controlled the line scan position relative to the specimen block-face.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe found that in most cases, no offset was needed after the SEM shutter was implemented. The FIB focus was also monitored before and after gallium source reheat, and controlled for smooth continuation. By implementing these measures, image focus could be restored immediately or within one frame after a restart, eliminating seams in the final image stack.\nMultiple magnifications at user-selected intervalsMultiple resolutions are often needed to resolve different features in an image stack, and to provide context. One option is to image the entire volume using the highest resolution needed. However, it proved far more efficient to change imaging resolution at different locations. For example, in a sample of fly brain, small and dense neuropil structures are surrounded by large cell bodies. Instead of imaging everything at high resolution, only the smaller regions of interest containing the neuronal connections are imaged at high resolution, while the larger area image(s) could be acquired more quickly at lower x, y, and z resolutions. These ROI's of different sizes and locations are first defined in the control software by boxes overlaid on a low-magnification image. The acquisition intervals of each ROI are also specified.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFirst, SEM acquires images pixel-by-pixel in series, whereas TEM acquires all pixels of the image in parallel, with orders of magnitude larger imaging current. Second, SEM detects backscattered or secondary electrons, emitted at a much smaller flux than the transmitted electrons measured by TEM. Third, the low SEM landing energy of <2 keV typically used to reduce the electron penetration depth into the block-face (thus increasing z-axis resolution) can reduce contrast, especially below 800 eV (Figure 15). Fourth, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a pixel depends on the number of primary electrons devoted to it, which in turn is determined by the beam current. For resolution of <10 nm at low landing energy, the incoming electron beam current must be limited to <10 nA, since higher current beams require larger apertures, which are subject to greater spherical and chromatic aberrations as well as Coulomb repulsion, creating unacceptable blur in the beam spot.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A triple point was found in each compound below 100 MPa. By pressurization, the low pressure phases disappeared at the triple point in the chloride and bromide while a new high-pressure phase appeared in the iodide. The pressures and temperatures of the triple points are 75.1 MPa, 175.7 K for CH3NH3PbCl3, 43.2 MPa, 152.9 K for CH3NH3PbBr3, and 84.8 MPa, 176.2 K for CH3NH3PbI3. All the boundaries between the cubic and tetragonal phases are upward convex and that of the iodide has a maximum at about 120 MPa. Other phase boundaries are essentially straight lines in the measured pressure and temperature ranges. By the use of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the transition volumes were calculated from the slopes of the phase boundaries and the transition entropies obtained in a previously published calorimetric experiment (J. Phys. Chem. Solids51, 1383 (1990)). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, the triple points were found in all of the three MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals below 100 MPa.The experimental DTA curves of MAPbBr, and MAPbI, in the high temperature region are shown in Figs 4 and5, respectively. The heating rates were 0.7-1.0 and 0.7-0.8 K min-' for MAPbBr, and MAPbI,, respectively. An endothermic peak due to the I4/mcm -Pm3m transition was observed in both samples. As indicated by the scales (and by the increased noise level in the base line of the curves) in Figs 4 and5, the peak heights of these transitions are much smaller than those of the other transitions shown before. This is because the I4/mcm -Pm3m transitions of both crystals are of a gradual type and the first-order component of the transition entropy is only 46% of the total [5]. The peak temperature decreased monotonically and the peak shape became broader with increasing pressure for MAPbBr,.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn a recent paper [5], we reported calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I), where MA represents the methylammonium ion, CH,NH: . All the phase transitions were of the first order. The large transition entropies indicated that the phase transitions are of the order-disorder type. The entropy values were interpreted with structural models in which each MA ion is disordered with respect to the orientations of the C-N axis itself and around the C-N axis.In the present paper, we investigate the pressure dependence of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) by using a high pressure DTA. Our purpose is to determine the p-T phase diagrams of the three halides and thereby to obtain \nEXPERIMENTALThe sample preparation of MAPbX, is the same as described in the previous paper [5]. The DTA experiments were performed with a home-made apparatus described elsewhere [8]. It was essentially a metal block made of copper-beryllium alloy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor MAPbI,, however, the transition line had a maximum around 110 MPa, below which the slope dT,,/dp was positive and above which negative. The peak shape and area did not change significantly in the whole pressure range. Table 2 summarizes the transition temperature T,, its pressure dependence dT,/dp, the transition entropy AuaS, and the transition volume AtR V. Here, AtnS is the value determined from calorimetry at atmospheric pressure [5]   All the values of the transition volume are quite small; less than 2% of the molar volume of MAPbX, (Cl: 110cm3 mol-I, Br: 124cm3 mol-', I: 153 cm3 mol-I). This indicates that the structural disorder discussed previously in relation to the transition entropies [5] is such that the methylammonium ions are packed as efficiently in the disordered phases as in the ordered phases. phase may have the same structure as the tetragonal P4/mmm phase of MAPbBr, and MAPbCl,.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In most cases when noninvasive imaging is not used, studies assume a consistent baseline condition in rats that lack visible differences. While performing a series of traumatic brain injury studies, we discovered mild spontaneous ventriculomegaly in 70 (43.2%) of 162 Wistar rats that had been obtained from 2 different vendors. Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, including MR angiography and diffusion tensor imaging, were used to evaluate the rats. Multiple neuropathologic abnormalities, including presumed arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, cysts, white matter lesions, and astrogliosis were found in association with ventriculomegaly. Postmortem microcomputed tomography and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Diffusion tensor imaging showed significant decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in multiple white matter tracts (p < 0.05). These results could impact the interpretation, for example, of a pseudo-increase of axon integrity and a pseudo-decrease of myelin integrity, based on characteristics intrinsic to rats with ventriculomegaly. We suggest the use of baseline imaging to prevent the inadvertent introduction of a high degree of variability in preclinical studies of neurologic disease or injury in Wistar rats. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAnatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition. Each animal's baseline brain MRI studies were reviewed independently by 3 investigators assessing the scans for any ventricular dilatation, asymmetrical ventricles, aqueduct stenosis, arachnoid cysts, cyst-like lesions, hyperintense lesions and otherwise unidentified bright objects. Animals without brain anomalies on baseline MRI were considered normal. The volume of ventricles or the hyperintense CSF compartments were quantified using National Institutes of Health ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) software and normalized to the volume of brain section at the same slices for cross comparison over each animal. A CSF compartment rating scale was applied to evaluate the ventricular and cystic abnormalities.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPostmortem micro-CT and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were also performed to verify the imaging findings and inspect the spontaneous anomalies in the CNS of the ventriculomegaly Wistar rats. The presence of these spontaneous ventriculomegaly patterns may be associated with abnormal vasculature, including aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Baseline scans are critical to exclude animals with ventriculomegaly and AVM anomalies to ensure consistent and reliable animal models of CNS diseases.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimal and Ventriculomegaly Rating ScaleEight-week-old Wistar rats purchased from Charles River (n = 134, female) and Harlan Laboratories (n = 28, including 22 female and 6 male) were examined. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at our institution. Anatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe inhalant anesthetic was delivered to the animal through a custom-made nose cone. Throughout MR scans, warm water was circulated under the animals to keep them warm at 37\u00b0C; a steady respiratory rate was monitored using a pressure sensor (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY), and maintained at 40 to 50 breaths/minute by isoflurane/oxygen mixture. For the baseline scan, high-resolution RARE MRI was first performed on every rat to acquire the anatomical T 2 -weighted images (TR 3.8 s, TE 15 ms, RARE factor 8, field of view [FOV] 2.56 \u00d7 2.56 [cm], matrix 256 \u00d7 256, in-plane resolution 100 \u00d7 100 [\u03bcm] with 0.5-mm thickness, number of excitation [NEX] 4, scan time 8 minutes).

The solvents used were \u03b3\u2010butyrolactone (BL), propylene carbonate (PC), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the salts included and . Cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes was correlated to their surface chemistry and morphology in the various solvent systems. The effects of both water and oxygen contamination were rigorously studied. It was found that the presence of oxygen in solutions considerably increased the cycling efficiency of the lithium electrode. This effect correlates well with the influence of the presence of oxygen on the surface morphology of lithium electrodes in solutions. The presence of water increases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in PC, and decreases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in ethers. These results are discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in the various solvent systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1.\n|Fig. 1.

Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nResults of a typical experiment measuring cyclic efficiency of lithium electrode in the cell shown in Fig. 1.

The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment.

For plate Li metal electrode, the huge uptake of current results in strong local electrical fi eld and extremely high concentration gradient of Li ions as driven force for high throughput transportation of electrons from electrode and ions from electrolyte, which is benefi cial for the dendrite growth. While for the nanostructured metallic Li anode, its 3D nanostructure with abundant electrode/electrolyte interfaces lower the absolute local current density even though applying the same current as Li anode. Thus both the gradients of electrical fi eld and Li ion concentration at local regions are reduced to orders of magnitude towards increased Sand's time and dendritefree morphology.

In this work, we demonstrate that a plasmonic resonance in top-down nanofabricated yttrium antennas can be completely and reversibly turned on and off using hydrogen exposure. We fabricate arrays of yttrium nanorods and optically observe, in extinction spectra, the hydrogen-induced phase transition between the metallic yttrium dihydride and the insulating trihydride. Whereas the yttrium dihydride nanostructures exhibit a pronounced particle plasmon resonance, the transition to yttrium trihydride leads to a complete vanishing of the resonant behavior. The plasmonic resonance in the dihydride state can be tuned over a wide wavelength range by simply varying the size of the nanostructures. Furthermore, we develop an analytical diffusion model to explain the temporal behavior of the hydrogen loading and unloading trajectories observed in our experiments and gain information about the thermodynamics of our device. Thus, our nanorod system serves as a versatile basic building block for active plasmonic devices ranging from switchable perfect absorbers to active local heating control elements. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n51 Furthermore, the system can be used as a hydrogen detector through monitoring the slope of YH 2 to YH 3 phase transition or to locally control chemical processes that require a certain activation energy. This energy can be provided by the enhanced local electric field generated by the plasmonic resonance, depending on the surrounding hydrogen concentration. Due to its high refractive index, YH 3 could even act as high-index nanophotonic material (n \u2248 2.8 at 600 nm 31,52 ) which supports electric and magnetic Mie resonances 53,54 that can be switched on and off using hydrogen. Other transition metals such as vanadium 55 or scandium, or transition metal alloys like Mg-Y, Mg-La, Mg-Sc, and Mg-Gd may provide even faster response. [56][57][58][59] Complete blackness and thus highest switching contrast could be expected using nickel metal hydrides (such as Mg 2 MeH x , with Me = Ni, Co, Fe).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe transition between metallic and dielectric yttrium hydride antennas is induced by simple hydrogen exposure from the gas phase or from electrolysis under ambient atmospheric conditions and shows a drastic change of the spectral response.Compared to other promising phase change materials used in plasmonic devices, yttrium dihydride has the advantage of comparatively low intrinsic damping and can therefore support plasmonic resonances itself, whereas the metallic phases of VO 2 , GST, or GLS are known to exhibit only a weak plasmonic response, if any. Despite the advantage of much faster switching times, they can often be used only in hybrid plasmonic systems, that is, in combination with gold or other good plasmonic metals. However, the use of hybrid systems drastically lowers the switching contrast, since only the dielectric environment of the resonant material changes and not the antenna itself. Therefore, yttrium dihydride is a highly relevant and very promising alternative for plasmonic applications that require a high switching contrast and are less dependent on ultrashort switching times.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n26 This impedes hydrogen from penetrating into the particle volume. Although the thin layer of platinum introduces some additional damping to our system, the overall influence on the plasmonic response is weak.Figure 2 shows typical extinction spectra of the different hydrogenation states of yttrium nanoantennas measured with a commercial Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy system (Bruker FTIR) and an incident electric field polarization parallel to the rods. Here, the rods have dimensions of 385 \u00d7 160 nm and a height of 50 nm yttrium plus 6 nm platinum.Pure yttrium is a metal with a relatively low electrical conductivity, 31,32 and therefore Y nanoantennas do not exhibit  a distinct plasmonic response in the visible and near-IR spectral region (gray dotted line in Figure 2). The decrease in extinction toward longer wavelengths can be attributed to the tail of a very strong and broad electronic resonance at about 3.1 eV (400 nm). 33 In contrast to Y, YH 2 is a good metal with a markedly different atomic and electronic structure.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I(1-x)Br(x))3 (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of \u03b3-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer. The process involves five stages, as depicted in Fig. 1c. First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate. Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent. Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min (Fig. 1b). As is apparent from Supplementary Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWhen the perovskite was deposited using a mixture of GBL and DMSO, followed by a toluene drip while spinning, extremely uniform and dense layers were formed. This solvent-engineering technology enabled a fully solution-processed perovskite solar cell with a certified 16.2% power-conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions.Figure 1 presents a schematic diagram of the cell architecture and deposition of perovskite materials by the solvent-engineering technology by means of spin-coating, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting coatings. The cell architecture (Fig. 1a) reveals a bilayer structure comprising mesoscopic and planar structures, and is effective for sufficiently absorbing light and collecting charges. Atop the mp-TiO 2 layer lies a highly uniform perovskite active layer (100-300 nm thick). Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Au metal were next deposited on the active layer as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1b). As is apparent from Supplementary Fig. 1, the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness.

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBL acknowledges the United Kingdom BBSRC (BB/D522403) for funding.

The distance criteria for acceptable hydrogen-bond length are under user control. Additionally, a test for acceptable sphericity of the electron density is performed.4.4.2. Add terminal residue. The MolProbity ', distribution is used to generate a set of randomly selected ', pairs.To build additional residues at the N-and C-termini of protein chains, the MolProbity ', distribution is used to generate a set of positions of the N, C , O and C atoms of the next two residues. The conformation of these new atoms is then scored against the electron-density map and recorded. This procedure is carried out a number of times (by default 100). The best-fitting conformation is offered as a candidate to the user (only the nearest of the two residues is kept).4.4.3. Add alternate conformation. Alternate conformations are generated by splitting the residue into two sets of conformations (A and B).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe mechanism in Coot addresses a number of ligand-fitting scenarios and is a modified form of a previously described algorithm (Oldfield, 2001). It is common practice in 'fragment screening' to soak different ligands into the same crystal (Blundell et al., 2002). Using Coot one can either specify a region in space or search a whole asymmetric unit for either a single or a number of different ligand types. In the 'whole-map' scenario, candidate ligand sites are found by cluster analysis of a residual map. The candidate ligands are fitted in turn to each site (with the candidate orientations being generated by matching the eigenvectors of the ligand to that of the cluster). Each candidate ligand is fitted and scored against the electron density. The best-fitting orientation of the ligand candidates is chosen.Ligands often contain a number of rotatable bonds. To account for this flexibility, Coot samples torsion angles around these rotatable bonds. Here, each rotatable bond is sampled from an independent probability distribution.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

By combining two short perpendicularly polarized pulses with frequencies centered at \u03c91 and \u03c92, where (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92)/\u03c91 \u226a 1, we can create a pulse with polarization that sweeps from circular through linear back to circular. It is possible to make the duration of the segment of the pulse capable of emitting short-wavelength radiation so small that emission is possible only for a time less than the period of the fundamental. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(3)  Those electrons that return to the vicinity of the ion emit harmonic radiation in a coherent interaction between the portion of the wave function remaining in the ground state and the returning portion (coherent spontaneous recombination to the ground state). In what follows we use the semiclassical version of this model 5 to describe the approach to producing attosecond pulses. The more comprehensive quantum treatments of the induced dipole moment gives substantially the same results, but, although it is more rigorous, the quantum treatment loses some of the transparency of the semiclassical description.Both the semiclassical and the quantum analyses indicate that, if viewed through a filter that passes only the highest harmonics, a sequence of short pulses [Fig. 1(a)], would be seen, much like the output of a mode-locked laser. We performed this calculation, assuming a 25-fs pulse of 800-nm light interacting with neon with a peak laser intensity of 6 X 1014 W/cm 2 . The filter had the transmission characteristics of 200-nm-thick silver film. 7 The filter ensures that frequencies below 100 eV are filtered out.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n9 The bandwidth of the two components can easily be broad enough to permit the synthesized pulse to fall sufficiently in intensity before the linear polarization condition can reappear, thus ensuring that harmonic emission is very weak at all times except near t = 0. Measurement of the time duration of subfemtosecond pulses also seems feasible. Since it is as complex as the production process it will be addressed elsewhere.' 3 Our approach to attosecond pulse generation is a special case of a much more general phenomenon, namely, coherent control of strong-field atomic processes. Here we have described how control over the trajectory of a continuum electron can modulate the high-order susceptibility in time. The same physics can be applied to the control of the atomic susceptibility in space. In fact, a relatively weak (control) beam of circularly polarized light propagating along the direction of the electric-field vector of the fundamental light will deflect an electron so that it misses the ion. Therefore the control beam can ensure that any atom illuminated by the control beam will be unable to emit harmonic radiation, thus permitting quasi-phase matching. We foresee its application to harmonic generation using ions.Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy combining two short perpendicularly polarized pulses with frequencies centered at aol and to 2 , where ((ol -wJ 2 )/wI << 1, we can create a pulse with polarization that sweeps from circular through linear back to circular. It is possible to make the duration of the segment of the pulse capable of emitting short-wavelength radiation so small that emission is possible only for a time less than the period of the fundamental.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nSince the development of the laser, obtaining shorter and shorter pulses has been a major emphasis of laser science. To approach the limit of 10 fs, at which short-pulse lasers currently operate,\" 2 nonresonant (Kerr) nonlinearities are used. However, the development of short-pulse coherent sources of less than 1-fs duration will require shorter-wavelength radiation and a new nonlinearity. In this Letter we introduce a method for producing pulses with durations approaching 1 atomic unit of time based on highharmonic emission from atomic gases.High harmonics have been extensively studied.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage size of 3.8 nm and the highest pore volume of 2.8 cm(3) g(-1) among reported Zr-MOFs. Moreover, PCN-777 shows excellent stability in aqueous environments, which makes it an ideal candidate as a support to incorporate different functional moieties. Through facile internal surface modification, the interaction between PCN-777 and different guests can be varied to realize efficient immobilization. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[5] Hence, their largest pores reach 31\u00c5 and 29\u00c5 respectively although the organic linkers are relatively small. Moreover, the metal nodes in these MOFs are based on trivalent metal species. The strong interaction between carboxylates and high valent metal species accompanied with the small organic linker endows these frameworks with excellent chemical stability.Despite these advantages, the pore size still restricts further application of these MOFs when it comes to larger guests such as nanoparticles or enzymes. Therefore, synthesis of mesoporous materials with larger pore size which also maintain excellent chemical stability is highly desired. Application of a ligand larger than those in the MIL-100 and MIL-101 MOFs to create zeotype frameworks would be an effective way to generate extra-large pores, while avoiding complicated organic synthesis to make the linker extremely large.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[1,2]  Due to their readily adjustable structures and tunable functionalities inside the frameworks, mesoporous MOFs facilitate the performance of those materials through heterogenization or isolation. However, the majority of reported MOFs are microporous. Difficulty in organic linker extension, variation of synthetic conditions in isoreticular structures, framework interpenetration and challenges in activation all hamper the development of novel mesoporous MOFs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nmechanical and the chemical stability of the framework decrease gradually. [3] Furthermore, the working environments of those immobilized moieties are usually harsh, which requires the frameworks to be chemically very stable. The requirement of a combination of good chemical stability and large pores means that very few candidates are widely utilized. MIL-101 and MIL-100 are two extraordinary examples that exhibit both properties and are suitable supports. [4] MIL-100 and MIL-101, both of which have zeotype mtn topology (zeotype refers to structures sharing the same topology with zeolites), contain super-tetrahedral cages to substitute for the tetrahedral unit in zeolites.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUnfortunately, there are several challenges in the way of extending these mtn topological MOFs: First, the M 3 O(COO) 6 (M= Fe(III), Al(III), Cr(III), In(III), V(III), Sc(III)) building block is not the thermodynamically favored form, which makes the controllable formation of target products difficult; [6] second, even if the inorganic building block can be obtained, competitive framework isomers, such as the MIL-88 structure, still dominate as the major products; moreover, most of the synthesis needs to be conducted under hydrothermal conditions, which is infeasible for large organic linkers with poor water solubility. Therefore, searching for other zeotype frameworks, which can be synthetically controlled more easily, is one promising strategy.Through a topological analysis, we herein present a zeotype mesoporous Zr-MOF, namely PCN-777, which has the \u03b2-cristobalite type structure. PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage (3.8nm) and the highest porosity (2.8cm 3 /g) among all the reported Zr-MOFs.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

By using \u03b1-Fe2O3/Ppy as the anode materials with iron foil as the current collector, the unique structure affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/diintercalation for Li-ion battery. A relatively high specific capacity of 0.42 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at 0.1 mA/cm2 even after 100 charge/discharge cycles, with a plateau potential of 1 V and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, suggesting the feasibility to use this unique 3D nanostructured hybrid composite for microbattery in both small and large scale applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe appearance of the strong peak at 1590 cm \u00c01 , weak peaks at 982 cm \u00c01 and 930 cm \u00c01 , which are assigned to C =C backbone stretching and ring-in plane deformation of PPY, respectively, indicating the successful polymerization of polypyrrole [16]. Similarly, the decrease in intensity of the typical X-ray diffraction peaks of a-Fe 2 O 3 is clearly observed in Figure 2  S5 andS6).

In Figure 1(c), it is clear that micrometersized flakes with thickness around 10-30 nm are generally pointed perpendicular to the plane of Fe foil. The nanoflakes are separated by distance in the range of 60-300 nm. A thin Ppy film is uniformly deposited onto the surface a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes array, forming a conformal coating around each nanoflakes without any coalescence between them (Figure 2d). The enlarge SEM image in Figure 2 clearly shows self-supported discontinuous nanoarchitectured a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composite.

Herein, a highly active and stable electrocatalyst of MoC encapsulated by graphitized carbon shells (nanoMoC@GS) has been developed via an in situ carburization of a Mo-based metal\u2013organic framework (Mo-MOF) with the atomic periodic structure. The ultrafine MoC nanoparticles (\u223c3 nm) confined by 1\u20133 layered graphite shells significantly favor the efficient HER in both acidic and basic media. In particular, a low overpotential (\u03b710 = 124 and 77 mV at a current density of \u221210 mA cm\u22122), a small Tafel slope (43 and 50 mV dec\u22121) and a high exchange current density (j0 = 0.015 and 0.212 mA cm\u22122) are achieved on nanoMoC@GS in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Such remarkable activity, outperforming most current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, stems from the cooperative/synergistic effects of ultrafine MoC nanostructure, ultrathin and conductive graphitized carbon shells, and enriched porosity.

Moreover, the smallest Tafel slope (46 mV dec \u00c01 ) was also obtained for nanoMoC@GS(700), suggesting that the reaction proceeds through the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism in which the electrochemical desorption step was rate limiting. 3,13 By extrapolating the Tafel plot, the exchange current density (j 0 ) of nanoMoC@GS(700) was calculated as 13.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 mA cm \u00c02 , which was also much higher than that of the other two samples derived from higher temperatures (Table S2 \u2020), re\ue104ecting the lower reaction resistance in this former sample.The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is directly related to the HER activity, but its accurate measurement for MoC x is difficult due to its unclear capacitive behavior. 21,22 Hence, the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (C dl ) measured by the CV method (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs shown in Fig. 6a, nano-MoC@GS(700) presented a much lower charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) value (14.5 U) than nanoMoC@GS(800) (28.6 U) and nanoMoC@GS(900) (69.5 U), indicating a faster electron transfer rate in the HER process. This lower R ct should be related to the con\ue103ned geometry in nanoMoC@GS materials, which would enhance the close interface contract of MoC nanoparticles with the ultrathin graphitized carbon shell and allow rapid charge transfer kinetics during the electrochemical process by improving the conductivity of electrocatalysts. The lowest R ct value for nanoMoC@GS(700) might result from its relatively large quantity of graphitized carbon (Table S1 \u2020).

Inhibitors that target the EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinases show therapeutic effects against LADCs containing EGFR gene mutations and ALK gene fusions, respectively. Recently, we and others identified the RET fusion gene as a new targetable driver gene in LADC. The RET fusions occur in 1-2% of LADCs. Existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of RET tyrosine kinase show promising therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as in a few patients. Clinical trials are underway to investigate the therapeutic effects of RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as vandetanib (ZD6474) and cabozantinib (XL184), in patients with RET fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(2) The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is activated by single amino acid substitution mutations or in-frame amino acid deletion mutations in 10-20% of LADC cases in the USA and in 30-40% of cases in East Asia. (2) Tumors harboring these EGFR mutations respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib and gefitinib, thereby improving progression-free survival and quality of life. (5,6) In addition, 3-5% of LADC harbor fusions that result in the activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene; such mutations are mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations. Inhibitors, such as crizotinib, that target ALK tyrosine kinase show marked therapeutic effects against ALK fusion-positive LADCs.

This is possible using conjugate-gradient techniques for energy minimization, and predicting the wave functions for new ionic positions using subspace alignment. This approach avoids the instabilities inherent in quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations for metals based on the use of a fictitious Newtonian dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity and allows us to perform simulations over several picoseconds. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTechnical parameters for each simulation can be found in Table 1. The F point only was used for the Brillouin-zone (BZ) sampling, resulting in a rather inaccurate description of the differential DOS (i.e., pseudogaps in the DOS), but it seems to be sufficient for a good description of the interatomic forces. Li, Na and Ge were initially equilibrated using simple pair potentials [32,33]; AI was melted from a simple cubic phase. For Na we have performed two model calculations, differing in the number of atoms. For the 54-atom ensemble, the Fermi-level falls into a pseudogap separating the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied band at the F-point. Therefore, the characteristic difficulties in handling metallic systems do not appear. The 60-atom ensemble on the other hand is metallic. We found no differences in the conservation of the free energy, demonstrating that our techniques works equally well in both situations. In addition, the comparison demonstrates that the influence of the boundary conditions is small.\nDiscussion\nSimple metalsIn Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNevertheless, it is interesting to do such calculations (i) to test the accuracy of the LDA and its finite temperature extension and (ii) to see whether our technique (i.e., exact evaluation of the groundstate at each timestep) works fast and reliably. This is not clear per se and the first CP calculations for metals had to face serious problems (see Section 2).We have performed ab initio MD simulations for three typical free-electron metals, Na, A1 and liquid Ge, and also for Li. The electronic density of states (DOS) for Li shows a significant deviation from a a Using modified RRKJ scheme [27,3,15]. b Using Vanderbilt scheme [31]. c Using ultrasoft pseudopotential [27,3,15].free electron parabola and therefore our results might serve as a critical benchmark for calculations using classical pairpotentials.

[3]) which can be used to perform complex calculations for many problems (i.e., bulk, surfaces, liquid systems, molecules). In this paper we give a short review of existing methods, describe our approach and present new results for liquid Li, Na and A1.

However, despite its ability to control matter with near-atomic precision, the technique is overlooked in most histories of nanoscience and nanotechnology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs the theorist in a small semiconductor research group, he proposed \"a non-stoichiometric mixed crystal of different semiconductors with different energy gaps\" 6    \nBUILDING NEW NANOSTRUCTURESThroughout the 1960s, researchers grappled with the challenge of making new crystalline materials for semiconductor applications. A good deal of the most significant work was done at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, between 1968 and 1973. At Bell Labs, for example, John R. Arthur Jr published a paper in July 1968 that described construction of epitaxial gallium arsenide layers using molecular beams of these elements 8 , and he filed a patent application for his work in the same year. Managers at Bell and IBM viewed GaAs, with its wide bandgap and high electron mobility, as a good candidate for high-speed electro-optical devices, and researchers liked the fact that the lattice constant of GaAs closely matches that of aluminium arsenide, another III-V semiconductor.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn October 1981 two physicists at Bell Labs, Horst St\u00f6rmer and Daniel Tsui, started to characterize a sample of Al-doped GaAs that Gossard's team had fabricated with its MBE machine. St\u00f6rmer and Tsui went on to discover the fractional quantum Hall effect, for which they shared the Nobel prize in 1998 (along with Robert Laughlin, who did the theory). In their Nobel lectures, both physicists acknowledged the pivotal role that Gossard's instrumental expertise had played in their discovery, with St\u00f6rmer calling such \"creators of materials\u2026the true heroes of our trade\" 13 .\nTHE VALUE OF HIDDEN HISTORIESMBE's success as a research tool and as a commercial process that provides the basis for billions of dollars of commerce seems to be partly responsible for its relative invisibility in the history of nanotechnology. MBE originated more than three decades ago at prestigious corporate laboratories that explored the basic science behind the microelectronic devices upon which their business rested. Over time, it matured to become a common yet flexible tool that was essential for research in many areas of nanoscience and technology.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nConsequently, structures built of alternating layers of AlAs and GaAs would figure prominently in early MBE studies.Alfred Y. Cho, an ambitious Chinese scientist who is sometimes called the 'father of MBE' , started working with John Arthur soon after he joined Bell Labs in 1968 (Fig. 1). Together they blended basic science with instrumental engineering as they improved their fabrication technique and studied the properties of the new materials they made. Cho had previously worked on ion-beam propulsion for space applications, which, he later explained, was the reason why his \"MBE systems all look like ion engines!\" 9 . At first, however, they could only produce a few hundred angstroms of GaAs per day, grown in layers that were too thin to accurately characterize.Over at IBM, meanwhile, Leo Esaki and Ray Tsu were grappling with a theoretical concept known as a superlattice. Whereas the heterostructures proposed by Kroemer contained just two layers of different materials, superlattices could be made of many very thin layers of two or more different semiconductors.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The general synthesis strategy is based on a sol-gel process associated with nonionic block copolymer as templates in ethanol solvent. Small-angle XRD, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption results show that these mesoporous aluminas possess a highly ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure, which is resistant to high temperature up to 1000 degrees C. Ordered mesoporous structures with tunable pore sizes are obtained with various precursors, different acids as pH adjustors, and different block copolymers as templates. These mesoporous aluminas have large surface areas (ca. 400 m2/g), pore volumes (ca. 0.70 cm3/g), and narrow pore-size distributions. The influence of the complexation ability of anions and hydro-carboxylic acid, acid volatility, and other important synthesis conditions are discussed in detail. Utilizing this simple strategy, we also obtained partly ordered mesoporous alumina with hydrous aluminum nitrate as the precursor. FTIR pyridine adsorption measurements indicate that a large amount of Lewis acid sites exist in these mesoporous aluminas. These materials are expected to be good candidates in catalysis due to the uniform pore structures, large surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and large amounts of surface Lewis acid sites. Loaded with ruthenium, the representative mesoporous alumina exhibits reactant size selectivity in hydrogenation of acetone, D-glucose, and D-(+)-cellobiose as a test reaction, indicating the potential applications in shape-selective catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThen 1.4-1.6 mL of 67 wt % nitric acid (or 1.4-1.6 mL of 37 wt % hydrochloric acid plus 0.5 g citric acid) and 2.04 g (10 mmol) of aluminum iso-propoxide were added into the above solution with vigorous stirring. The mixture was covered with PE film, stirred at room temperature for about 5 h, and then put into a 60 \u00b0C drying oven to undergo the solvent evaporation process. After 2 days of aging, the solution became a light-yellow solid (when hydrochloric acid and citric acid were used, white solids were obtained). Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0C min -1 ramping rate) and by heating at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h in air.

The highly ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores along [001] direction and the alignment of cylindrical pores along [110] direction are observed. With the samples prepared in different batches, more images (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) display the similar well-ordered pore network observed for the sample Al-1 calcined at 400 \u00b0C and show the consistence between the same sample viewed from different areas and between the samples prepared in different batches.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[44][45][46] The amount of absorbed pyridine on Lewis acid sites is estimated by integration of the band (V 19b mode) around 1450 cm -1 .

The 4th edition of the WHO classification incorporates new information that has emerged from scientific and clinical studies in the interval since the publication of the 3rd edition in 2001, and includes new criteria for the recognition of some previously described neoplasms as well as clarification and refinement of the defining criteria for others. It also adds entities-some defined principally by genetic features-that have only recently been characterized. In this paper, the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia is highlighted with the aim of familiarizing hematologists, clinical scientists, and hematopathologists not only with the major changes in the classification but also with the rationale for those changes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n21,77 Despite the dilemma and controversy regarding how to incorporate recently described and clinically important genetic lesions into the revised scheme, the framework of the classification proved flexible enough so that new, well-defined entities could be incorporated as could provisional entities-those for which more data need to be collected so that they can be better characterized. Table 2 shows the revised AML classification. In the subgroup of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, 3 entities included in the previous edition are retained: (1) AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1; (2) AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16; 16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11; and (3) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMore study is needed to clarify these questions, thus RCC is considered as a provisional entity. \nSignificant changes in the diagnosis and classification of MDS\nAcute myeloid leukemia and related precursor neoplasmsThe previous edition of the WHO classification ushered in the era of incorporation of genetic abnormalities into diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of AML. The 4 abnormalities initially included in the subgroup \"AML with recurring genetic abnormalities\" involved rearrangements of genes (RUNX1, CBFB, RARA, and MLL) that encode transcription factors and that are associated with fairly distinct clinical and morphologic features. Since the publication of the 3rd edition of the classification, it has become more widely appreciated that multiple genetic lesions-including not only microscopically detectable chromosomal rearrangements or numerical abnormalities but also submicroscopic gene mutations-cooperate to establish the leukemic process and influence its morphologic and clinical characteristics.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOne of the lively discussions at the CAC meeting was whether to recommend continued subclassification within this group by criteria similar to those of the previous French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme for AML, or to designate all such cases merely as AML, NOS. The argument that specific genetic abnormalities may yet be found that will further characterize some AML, NOS subgroups prevailed as a reason for maintaining the subclassification. Furthermore, for prognostic purposes, it may still be important to recognize some disorders such as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis, and pure acute erythroleukemia. However, it is important to note that the information used to characterize the subgroups in this category, such as epidemiologic or clinical outcome data, is often based on older studies that included patients who would now be assigned to different WHO diagnostic categories. Therefore, such information may no longer be reliable for patients now classified in this subgroup.Three additional myeloid neoplasms in the AML listing include myeloid sarcoma, the myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome, and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

First discovered in the context of transverse gain-guided semiconductor lasers [4] and subsequently generalized [2,[5][6][7][8][9][10], this factor arises from the non-Hermitian nature of the laser wave equation, due to the presence of the gain medium as well as the openness of the laser cavity (i.e. spatially non-uniform outcoupling loss). It always leads to an enhancement of the linewidth, even with uniform gain and no gain-guiding. Typically, it is calculated from the non-orthogonal passive cavity resonances asK = dr |\u03d5(r)| 2 dr \u03d5(r) 2 2 ,(2)where the integrals are taken over the cavity [11]. In effect, the Petermann factor changes the ST linewidth by the replacement \u03b3 2 c \u2192 K\u03b3 2 c . This is a significant correction for lasers with large outcoupling, in the range 1.1-1.6 for the conventional semiconductor lasers studied in Ref. [2].\n\nExcerpt 2: \n42\n\t\t\t\t\t55\n\t\t\t\t\tZz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nA formula for the laser linewidth of arbitrary cavities in the multimode non-linear regime is derived from a scattering analysis of the solutions to semiclassical laser theory. The theory generalizes previous treatments of the effects of gain and openness described by the Petermann factor. The linewidth is expressed using quantities based on the non-linear scattering matrix, which can be computed from steady-state ab initio laser theory; unlike previous treatments, no passive cavity or phenomenological parameters are involved.

It is the most important property of lasers which arises from the quantization of the electromagnetic field.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[2]. We shall refer to the standard theory, inclusive of the Petermann factor, as the Schawlow-Townes-Petermann (STP) theory.The extensive and impressive literature on the Petermann factor [2,[4][5][6][7][8][9][10]12] has, with one major exception [9], only treated single-mode lasing near threshold, neglecting the effects of spatial hole-burning. And apart from a recent paper by Schomerus [12], the literature has exclusively treated one-dimensional or waveguide lasers, and thus is not directly applicable to the wide variety of complex laser cavities developed during the past twenty years, such as microdisk and deformed-disk, photonic crystal, and random lasers. In this Letter, we derive a general formula for the intrinsic laser linewidth in arbitrary cavities, which is valid far from threshold, with strong spatial hole-burning, and in the multimode regime.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTranscribed strand information was assigned to the individual reads based on knowledge of the fragment type (left or right) and the aligned strand of the genome. Both Cufflinks (version 0.9.3) 2 and Scripture 3 (version VPaperR3, obtained from Scripture author Manuel Garber) were executed on these alignments.\nEvaluation of published de novo methodsIllumina reads were de novo assembled using ABySS 1 (version 1.2.1), SOAPdenovo 6 (version 1.04) or Trans-ABySS 27 . Command-line parameters used with ABySS were \"abyss-pe k=25 E=0 n=10 in= 'left.fa right.fa' \", employing a K-mer length of 25. Likewise, a 25-mer length was employed with SOAPdenovo along with other default parameters. Trans-ABySS 27 was run on Mouse and S. pombe using a set of k-mers including 26, 31, 36, 41, and 46 followed by merging the results by running the 1 st stage of the trans-ABySS analysis pipeline.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n5a). Trinity performed well across a range of 10M to the full 150M input sequence reads, while the alternative methods tended to peak at ~50M pairs or smaller inputs (Supplementary Fig. 6a online). In mouse (RefSeq annotation set, Fig. 5b), Trinity (8185 transcripts, 7749 genes) outperformed the other de novo assembly methods ABySS (5561, 5500), Trans-ABySS (7025, 6598) and SOAPdenovo (761, 760), with the mapping-first programs Cufflinks (9010, 8536) and Scripture (9086, 8293) exhibiting better sensitivity. Furthermore, Trinity and Cufflinks appear best-tuned in their sensitivity across the broadest range of expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). Unlike Trinity, several of the de novo methods did not perform well in fully reconstructing transcripts within the highest expression quintiles (Supplementary Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFull-length reference annotation mappings were defined as having at least 95% sequence identity covering the entire reference coding sequence and containing at most 5% insertions or deletions (cumulative gap content). In evaluating methods that leverage the strand-specific data (Trinity and Cufflinks), proper sense-strand mapping of sequences was required. Transcripts reconstructed by the alternative methods (Scripture, ABySS, and SOAPdenovo) were allowed to map to either strand. Fusion transcripts were identified as individual reconstructed transcripts that mapped as full-length to multiple reference coding sequences and lacked overlap among the matching regions within the reconstructed transcript. One-toone mappings were required between reconstructed transcripts and reference transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms, with the exception of fusion transcripts.\nAnalysis of alignment-inferred introns and splicing patterns from reconstructed transcriptsReconstructed transcripts were mapped to genome sequences using GMAP, reporting only the single top scoring alignment per sequence. Individual introns and complete splicing patterns were extracted from each of the alignments and compared to reference annotations using custom PERL scripts. Unique introns (missing from the reference annotations) were required to contain consensus dinucleotide splice sites (GT or GC donors and AG acceptors).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify (1) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., areas of natural \"resistance\" to bleaching) and (2) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred (i.e., areas of natural community \"resilience\"). These \"target areas,\" where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, Salm et al. (2001) have proposed that through thoughtful planning and strategic care of reefs within existing and future marine protected areas (MPAs)*, it may be possible to take advantage in two broad ways of the natural properties of coral reef ecosystems to mitigate the negative impact of bleaching on coral reef biodiversity:(1) Identify and manage specific patches of reef where local conditions are likely to result in reduced temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., coral assemblages with a high level of \"resistance\") to protect them from direct anthropogenic impacts. (2) Enhance the capacity for coral reef recovery (\"resilience\") by maintaining conditions optimal for larval dispersal and recruitment to damaged sites (requires minimizing other stresses at these sites [abatement of direct localized impacts] and analyzing larval dispersal [connectivity] to maximize recolonization).An understanding of which local environmental factors are predictors of greatest resistance and resilience to coral bleaching would help managers identify, design, and manage networks of MPAs in order to maximize overall survival of the world's coral reefs in the face of global climate change.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nConfirmation of environmental factors that afford protection from bleaching mortality may necessitate consideration of additional site-selection criteria from a new category: survivability and resilience to climate change. That is, when evaluating existing MPAs or planning new ones, MPA managers should consider site-selection criteria that will allow coral communities that are reliably influenced by one or more protective environmental factors to be carefully monitored and adaptively managed. Managers should also manage sites down-current of these areas to enhance conditions for larval settlement and recovery of these dependent areas.\nConclusionsIn the context of existing monitoring programs, managers could begin by surveying reefs inside and outside MPAs for the presence of reef areas with one or more reliable factors. They could then begin a process to exert higher levels of control at these locations, either by modifying management activities and zoning schemes in existing MPAs or by establishing increased protection for newly defined target areas. At the same time, the efficacy of these policies should be tested by including these sites in the suggested hypothesis-driven monitoring program to test the reliability and significance of the resistance and resilience factors.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe most useful approach would be one that utilizes natural processes rather than expensive technological fixes and helps managers focus local management and enforcement efforts on the most criti-cal areas. Given the limited capacity and funding available for management in many coral-reef countries, what is especially needed are simple tractable strategies that any manager could begin to adopt immediately to maximize long-term survival of the broadest range of coral communities and reef types.We confine our discussion to local-scale resistance that occurs despite the presence of \"mass bleaching conditions\" in an area or region. This resistance is distinct from avoidance, in which large areas or regions may never be tested by bleaching conditions at all due to larger-scale climatological and oceanographic phenomena ( Done 2001 ). Although the latter is an important area of ongoing research, here we focus on determinants of local-scale resistance within areas or regions that have experienced bleaching conditions, because this is an important scale at which local managers work. Therefore, building on the work of Salm et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To identify the genetic alterations in this tumor type, we searched for copy number alterations using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and microRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 MBs. We found that, on average, each tumor had 11 gene alterations, fewer by a factor of 5 to 10 than in the adult solid tumors that have been sequenced to date. In addition to alterations in the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, our analysis led to the discovery of genes not previously known to be altered in MBs. Most notably, inactivating mutations of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase genes MLL2 or MLL3 were identified in 16% of MB patients. These results demonstrate key differences between the genetic landscapes of adult and childhood cancers, highlight dysregulation of developmental pathways as an important mechanism underlying MBs, and identify a role for a specific type of histone methylation in human tumorigenesis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMost recently, frequent mutations of the chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A have been discovered in ovarian clear cell carcinomas (20,35); of note, one ARID1A mutation was discovered in our MB patients (table S4). A link between histone methylation genes (although not MLL2 or MLL3) and MB has also previously been hypothesized based on the observation that copy number alterations affecting chromosomal regions containing histone methyltransferases or demethylases occur in a subset of MBs (36).The mechanism(s) through which MLL genes contribute to tumorigenesis are not known but some clues can be gleaned from the literature. The MLL family of histone H3K4 trimethylases includes seven genes (MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, MLL5, SET1A and SET1B) (37). MLL-family genes have been shown to regulate HOX gene expression (38,39), and an attractive possibility is that they normally downregulate OTX2, an MB oncogene (6,7,40).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis genetic evidence is consistent with functional studies showing that knock-out of murine MLL3 results in ureteral epithelial cancers (29). These genes are large and have been reported in the COSMIC database to be altered in occasional cancers, but not at a sufficiently high frequency to distinguish them from passenger alterations (and with no evidence of a high fraction of inactivating mutations) (30). Interestingly, inactivating germline mutations of MLL2 have recently been identified as a cause of Kabuki syndrome, a multiple malformation disorder without known cancer predisposition (31).The general role of genes controlling histone methylation has become increasingly recognized as a common feature of human cancers. For example, inactivating mutations of the histone H3K27 demethylase gene UTX have been observed in multiple myelomas, esophageal cancers and renal cell cancers (32). In addition, a small fraction of renal cell cancers contain mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2 and the histone demethylase gene JARID1C (33), and the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 has been found to be mutated in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (34).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt should thus be informative to characterize the methylation status of histones and DNA in MBs with and without MLL2/MLL3 gene alterations, as well as to determine the expression changes resulting from these gene mutations. These data highlight the important connection between genetic alterations in the cancer genome and epigenetic pathways and provide potentially new avenues for research and disease management in MB patients.    \u2020 Based on 21 nonhypermutable tumors analyzed in (19). \u2021 Based on 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors analyzed in (16,17).\u00a7 Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total non-silent mutations. ^Ratio of observed to expected nonsense alterations is dependent on mutation spectra in each tumor type (21). ** Includes synonymous as well as nonsynonymous point mutations identified in the indicated study. \u2020 \u2020 Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total substitutionsFig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.\nResults: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.\nAvailability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThese quality issues can be seen clearly in the FastQC plots, shown in the Supplementary Figure S1, compared with the much higher average quality of the post-filtered data, as shown in Supplementary Figure S2.Not surprisingly, trimming is even more critical to achieving acceptable alignment rates with these data. The final part of Table 1 shows that 51.5% of the reads align in strict mode, which requires a perfect match, while just 7% of the reads can be aligned when allowing for one mismatch. Even with the liberal default settings, allowing nine mismatches,525% (197 933 reads) can be aligned. However, after trimming, almost 78% of the reads align perfectly.\nDe novo assemblyBoth datasets also showed considerable improvement in a de novo assembly scenario. For the first dataset, the contig N50 size increased by 58% (95 389 versus 60 370 bp) after preprocessing, while the maximum contig size improved by $28%.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nQuality filteringTrimmomatic offers two main quality filtering alternatives. Both approaches exploit the Illumina quality score of each base position to determine where the read should be cut, resulting in the retention of the 5 0 portion, while the sequence on the 3 0 of the cut point is discarded. This fits well with typical Illumina data, which generally have poorer quality toward the 3 0 end. These two approaches are described in the following sections.\nSliding Window quality filteringThe Sliding Window uses a relatively standard approach. This works by scanning from the 5 0 end of the read, and removes the 3 0 end of the read when the average quality of a group of bases drops below a specified threshold. This prevents a single weak base causing the removal of subsequent high-quality data, while still ensuring that a consecutive series of poor-quality bases will trigger trimming.\nMaximum Information quality filteringA novel alternative approach was motivated by the realization that, for many applications, the incremental value of retaining additional bases in a read is related to the read length. Intuitively, it is clear that short reads are almost worthless because they occur multiple times within the target sequence and thus they give only ambiguous information.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAlso, the assembly from unfiltered data contained a 34-bp perfect match to an adapter sequence, while no adapters were found in the filtered assemblies.The second dataset showed even greater benefits after trimming, with $77% improvement in N50 contig size (177 880 versus 100 662 bp) and $55% increase in maximum contig size. Perhaps surprisingly, no adapter sequences were found in the assembly of the untrimmed version of this dataset.\nComparison with existing toolsWe also compared the performance of Trimmomatic with a variety of existing adapter and quality filtering tools in similar referenced-based scenarios, as described in the Supplementary Methods. The tools selected were AdapterRemoval (Lindgreen, 2012), and Scythe/Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/), which fully support paired-end data and EA-Utils (Aronesty, 2013), which maintains read pairing but loses singletons (reads whose mate has been filtered).

Our results suggest that close-packed electrodes may become not only instrumental for neuroscience, but also for understanding the basic principles of electrode design when scaling to large channel counts is required. We note that our current technologies are not designed for long-term recording, which may benefit from probes that are coated with alternative materials [27], as well as thinner probes that may be more flexible [28]; our main focus here was on the principles of scalability, as well as acute recordings. Future work may enable such scalable devices to be deployed in both chronic and acute settings, as well as allow integration with other technologies such as 3-D light delivery for optogenetics [29]- [31], and the ability to connect spatial localization of neurons with detailed anatomical mapping via high-resolution microscopy [32].Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1. Close-packed recording sites on a silicon shank, for spatially oversampled neural recording.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nfrom a dense array [12]- [15]. In this paper, we demonstrate a close-packed silicon microelectrode technology that enables a tight continuum of recording sites along the length of the shank (Fig. 1), rather than discrete arrangements of tetrode-style pads or widely spaced sites. This arrangement, thus, enables tetrodelike spatial oversampling continuously running down the shank, so that sorting of spikes recorded by such densely packed electrodes can be facilitated for all the sites of the probe simultaneously. We use advanced lithography tools to create these close-packed arrangements in a scalable fashion, demonstrating probes with 1000 electrode pads situated on five shanks with 200 recording sites per shank. A key challenge with the traditional silicon electrode designs has been that wiring to the recording sites occupied a large fraction of the available shank width. This is problematic because scaling up the number of recording sites forces the shank geometry to widen, placing an upper bound on the number of sites practical for a single shank of a given width. We here reduced the wire geometry and, thus, the overhead that the wiring places on the shank width by creating submicron wires with high-speed electron beam lithography (EBL).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules associate in vivo.

In this model, CG18292 (or DOC1 in mammalian cells) might either interact with PMMR by itself or as part of the CS complex.In summary, our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of the complete and functional NuRD complex via preformed and active sub-modules. The fact that the sub-modules retain similar enzymatic activities and are present in different cellular compartments when expressed at endogenous levels is consistent with the idea that they may have independent activities in both the nucleus and the cytosol.\nMaterials and MethodsProduction and purification of NuRD complexes Endogenous NuRD complex was purified from Drosophila S2 Schneider cells using stable cell lines and a metallothionein-induceable promoter (Thermo Fischer Scientific) as described in Supplementary Data.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOn the other hand, under the FF null model NODF identified only three empirical matrices as being nested. NODF also indicated that nestedness in species occupancy (mean 054.0) is significantly lower than nestedness in species composition among sites (mean 060.6; Z 0(9.25, pB0.001).\nDiscussionWhy another metric?The occurrence of nestedness in ecological systems provides clues about the processes that affect species distributions among different sites and that shape interspecific interactions (Lomolino 1996, Leibold and Mikkelson 2002, Thompson 2005, 2006, Lewinsohn et al. 2006, Guimara \u02dces et al. 2007b). In addition, its quantification can be used to guide conservation strategies (Atmar and Patterson 1993, Cutler 1991, 1994, Boecklen 1997) and to understand the fragility and co-evolution of networks of ecological interactions (Thompson 2005, 2006, Jordano et al. 2006). Therefore, it is fundamental to measure such structure properly.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs NODF can be used to quantify nestedness only among columns and only among rows, we also evaluated: (1) whether more endemic species occupied a subset of the sites where more widespread species were found, and (2) whether species-poor sites had proper subsets of the species found in more species rich ones. This second metacommunity feature is what most nestedness metrics aim to quantify. However, T measures whether 1's are located at the upper-left side of a matrix, and it cannot distinguish the two above cited metacommunity features. On the other hand, measures based on Brualdi and Sanderson's (1999) discrepancy and Nc quantify nestedness only among columns or rows.Null models, simulated matrices and nestedness measures were generated and calculated by the software applications Aninhado (Guimara \u02dces and Guimara \u02dces 2006 Bwww.guimaraes.bio.br !), Cooc (Ulrich 2007), Nestedness (Ulrich 2006a), Matrix (Ulrich 2006b), and Nestedness programme (Acknowledgments).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNestedness in empirical metacommunitiesOur analysis of empirical matrices compiled by Atmar and Patterson (1995) showed that the degree of nestedness obtained by NT, NC and Nd1 are significantly higher than those calculated through NODF. A simple possible explanation for these differences is that a perfect nested matrix according to NODF needs to have 50% of 1's whereas the other metrics adjust their maximum values for the observed fill. However, this seems not be the case. These differences were also verified when we measured NODF exclusively for columns or for rows. Given that perfect nestedness only for columns or for rows do not need to have matrix fill close to 50%, the above mentioned analytical explanation does not prevail. In fact, a probable reason for these differences is the high number of columns and rows with identical marginal totals in the empirical matrices. These pairs of columns and of rows with identical marginal totals have no degree of nestedness according to NODF, but they can be perfectly nested according to the other metrics.We also showed that the degree of nestedness for species composition is higher than that for species occupancy.

However, single-cell differences have been largely neglected in the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation. Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function--such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells--are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n10). Forty-eight cells in each of 30 samples (15 baseline and 15 perturbed cell lines) were assayed using a combination of flow cytometry and microfluidic gene expression chips 8 (Online Methods).We observed variability both in the average gene expression values as well as distribution of expression values between the 15 individuals in both the unperturbed and inhibitor-treated cell populations (Fig. 1b,c). A number of parameters can be deduced from these data and the correlation of these to genetic variants tested.Considering gene expression phenotypes in terms of single-cell distributions provides important information about gene regulation, as the noise from the regulation of transcription can be considered separately from the noise of RNA turnover (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus constitutively expressed genes, for example, are expected to be less noisy, demonstrating mostly the thermodynamic noise of RNA turnover in the absence of variable regulation (Supplementary Fig. 1). Analyzing four, public, single-cell RNA sequencing data sets 6,7 , we found that this is indeed the case (Supplementary Notes, section 1).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe refer to these variants as single-cell quantitative trait loci (scQTLs).To demonstrate the importance of cell-to-cell variability, we measured gene expression of selected genes in fresh, naive B lymphocytes from three individuals. Gene expression typically had much greater variability between cells within an individual than between individuals, and the distribution of gene expression values is very different between individuals for some genes. (Fig. 1a). The currently understood reasons for this large cell-to-cell noise are thermodynamic, regulatory and cellular (Supplementary Fig. 1).As a basis for studying the association of single-cell phenotypes with genetic variants, we first sought to generate high-quality data in a large population of cells (1,440 cells). We measured gene expression using highly parallel qPCR validated with digital PCR, as single-cell RNA sequencing still faces notable technical challenges 6,7 . We focused on 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling, a major regulator of the cell cycle that has been highlighted as a key pathway in clinical GWAS and cancer epidemiology (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis is most commonly seen when cancer somatic variations result in pronounced transcriptomic changes. Theoretical discussions around concepts such as self-organizing criticality 3 have proven popular as attempts at explaining this observed complexity of gene expression and its regulation. The same lack of 'smoothness' can be seen with the environmental perturbation of gene expression-as recently demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-exposed immune cells 4 -and is likely to become an important theme in the pharmacogenomics of gene function.Although a number of disease-associated genetic variants have been shown to be linked to eQTLs 5 , in most cases no such correlation exists. We hypothesize that instead of influencing the average gene expression of a gene in a whole organism or a specific cell type or tissue, these variants might change the cell-to-cell variability, temporal dynamics or cell cycle dependence of gene expression at the single-cell level.Here we explore whether studying individual cells can begin to provide greater mechanistic insights into how SNPs quantitatively affect gene function, as opposed to just assaying their effects on average tissue expression.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The ignimbrite is crystal rich (20\u201330%), of rhyodacite to low-silica rhyolite composition and lacks any consistent compositional zonation. Pumice whole-rock and glass compositions and crystal rim chemistries imply that the final erupted magma body was, to a first order, homogeneous, with the only variations reflecting crystal:glass proportions in analysed clasts. Crystals from pumices can be divided into two populations based on textural and chemical signatures: those that are inferred to have grown within the final erupted magma body (82% of plagioclase, 88% of orthopyroxene, 17% of amphibole), and those that originated in a chemically heterogeneous mush zone (18% of plagioclase, 12% of orthopyroxene, 83% of amphibole). Crystal-rich microcrystalline clasts, and clots within pumices, provide direct samples of parts of this heterogeneous source region. Amphibole model temperatures and pressures, coupled with in-situ trace element concentrations suggest that the mush region extended to ~ 15 km depth, near the base of the quartzofeldspathic crust and was rich in amphibole. Amphibole plus subordinate plagioclase and orthopyroxene, as well as antecrystic zircon were extracted from the crystal mush and ascended to a final storage region. Model temperatures and pressures from amphibole rims and Fe\u2013Ti oxide model temperatures imply that the final erupted magma body was stored between 770 and 840 \u00b0C at 4\u20136 km depths. Homogenisation of the magma body occurred through convective stirring accompanying gradually rising temperatures induced by less-evolved magma(s) emplaced at deeper levels. Plagioclase records a steady core-to-rim increase in An content, implying that a gradual heating and/or increase in H2O in the final erupted magma body occurred over some significant period prior to the eruption. No signals of a rapid defrosting or rejuvenation event that could be considered as an eruption trigger are recorded by the crystal phases. The Ongatiti ignimbrite has features both common to, and distinct from crystal rich \u2018monotonous intermediates\u2019 and crystal-poor compositionally zoned rhyolites. As such, the Ongatiti ignimbrite demonstrates that \u2018monotonous rhyolites\u2019 can also be developed on a large scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n11b).The range in modelled pre-eruptive conditions, and the contrast in modelled pressures and temperatures between rims and cores correspond well with independently determined in-situ trace element concentrations. The lower depth of pre-eruptive conditions (~6 km) is marked by a significant change in amphibole chemistry at Al T values of ~0.4 and Eu/Eu* of ~0.3 (dashed line in Fig. 8). The maximum estimated depth of ~15 km is consistent with the estimated depth (~16 km) of the base of the quartzo-feldspathic crust beneath much of the central TVZ (e.g., Harrison and White, 2006). The exact depth of the crust beneath Mangakino (to the north west of modelled seismic arrays) is, however, not well constrained. The validity of model amphibole temperatures and pressures was assessed using cation abundances calculated following the method of Leake et al. (2004). Evidence for both temperature (edenite and Ti-Tschermak) and pressure (Al-tschermak) sensitive atomic substitution mechanisms are found across the whole amphibole dataset (cf.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese temperature and oxygen fugacity estimates fall between the NNO and FMQ buffer curves (Fig. 11a).\nAmphibole temperature and pressureAmphiboles have the potential to record magmatic temperature and pressure changes during growth of the crystal (Johnson and Rutherford, 1989;Rutherford and Devine, 2003). Estimates of apparent temperature and pressure were made on amphiboles using the method of Ridolfi et al. (2010). Amphibole cores display a large and continuous range in apparent temperatures and pressures from 780 to 970 \u00b0C and 110 to 390 MPa (Figs. 11b andS5). Model temperatures and pressures of rims are significantly restricted in comparison, and range from 780 to 840 \u00b0C and 110 to 170 MPa (Figs. 11b andS5). These conditions correspond to model depths of amphibole core crystallisation between ~4 to 15 km and final pre-eruptive depths (crystallisation of rims) at shallower crustal levels between ~4 to 6 km (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe zircon age record coupled with the diversity in crystal core compositions supports the notion of a large crystal-rich (mush) body with subordinate melt that was present for the 1-2 \u00d7 10 5 year period prior to eruption.Within the Ongatiti magma system, model temperatures and pressures from high-Al cored amphiboles suggest that a thermally and chemically variable crystal mush/source may have reached to depths close to the base of the quartzofeldspathic crust (~15 km).Controversies about the role of melt chemisty, H 2 O and \u0192O 2 in influencing model temperatures and pressures yielded by the single-phase model of Ridolfi et al. (2010) may mean that some values are unrealistic (e.g., Coombs et al., 2013, citing Browne, 2005). In addition to evidence of temperature and pressure controlled cation exchange in amphibole (Fig. S6), three factors suggest that the model figures may be valid to a first order. First, at all stages the amphiboles appear to have cocrystallised with plagioclase, so ensuring that Al contents in the melt were buffered.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The exact reaction process by which they originate is still debated and their hybrid nature is controversial. We show that textural and chemical inheritances of the pre-existing mantle are preserved in olivine-rich troctolites recently sampled at the Central Indian Ridge. The occurrence of a large orthopyroxene of a probable mantle origin suggests that these rocks formed through the reactive overprint of a mantle peridotite. Combining our data with those of olivine-rich troctolites worldwide, we show that the clinopyroxenes from these rocks follow chemical trends slightly distinct to those of the oceanic gabbros. These chemical trends can be ascribed to crystallization from melts assimilating mantle peridotites, suggesting that a \u201cmantle flavor\u201d can be locally retained in these hybrid rocks. The present distribution of Ol-rich troctolites suggests that melt-mantle reaction processes by which these rocks originate is likely to be more diffuse at slower spreading environments, where extensive melt-rock reactions within a thick thermal boundary layer enhances the conversion of the shallow oceanic mantle into hybrid crustal rocks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe case for reactive crystallization at mid-ocean ridges\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLCollier\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPBKelemen\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Petrology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t51\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEvidence from oceanic gabbros for porous melt migration within a crystal mush beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLACoogan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADSaunders\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPDKempton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJNorry\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEarth and Planetary Science Letters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t176\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe lower oceanic crust\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLCoogan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTreatise on Geochemistry 3.19\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKKTurekian\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKDHolland\n\t\t\n\t\tAmsterdam\n\t\t\n\t\t\tElsevier\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA neodymium and strontium isotopic study of the Mesozoic calc-alkaline granitic batholiths of the Sierra Nevada and Peninsula Ranges, California\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDJDepaolo\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Geophysical Research\n\t\t\n\t\t\t86\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1981\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMelt-rock reaction in the lower ocean crust and its implications for the genesis of mid-ocean ridge basalt\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJLissenberg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHJ BDick\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEarth and Planetary Science Letters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t271\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2008\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPervasive reactive melt migration through fast-spreading lower oceanic rust (Hess Deep, equatorial Pacific Ocean)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJLissenberg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKAHoward\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJMacleod\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGodard\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEarth and Planetary Science Letters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t361\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIgneous, alteration and exhumation processes recorded in abyssal peridotites and related fault rocks from an Oceanic Core Complex along the Central Indian Ridge\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTMorishita\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKHara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKNakamura\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTSawaguchi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTamura\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSArai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKOkino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKTakai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHKumagai\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Petrology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2009\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis is in agreement with the evidence that the extreme Zr/Nd fractionations are documented exclusively in the rim/interstitial/filmlike Cpx grains, which likely crystallized at the final stages of the interaction process (Drouin et al., 2009). Given the number of variables arbitrarily fixed in this calculation (e.g. compositions of the initial melt and of the assimilated phases), we cannot demonstrate that this AFC process is the only contributor to the incompatible element budget of the Cpx from the Ol-rich troctolites. However, our calculation supports the idea that the different Zr, Nd and Yb variations of the Cpx in Ol-rich troctolites and those in gabbros may be related to different melt-rock reaction scenarios, respectively in mantle and lower crustal environments.In agreement with the occurrence of a relict mantle Opx, the chemistry of the Cpx from Ol-rich troctolites worldwide suggest that these rocks most likely formed by melts buffered by the dissolution of a preexisting Opx-bearing mantle peridotite.

Our calculations show a band structure close to the free-electron-like limit due to the high electronic kinetic energy induced by pressure. Bands are properly described even in the independent electron approximation fully neglecting the electron-electron interaction. Linear-response harmonic calculations show a dynamically stable phonon spectrum with marked Kohn anomalies. Even if the electron-electron interaction has a minor role in the electronic bands, the inclusion of electronic exchange and correlation in the density response is essential to obtain a dynamically stable structure. Anharmonic effects, which are calculated within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, harden high-energy optical modes and soften transverse acoustic modes up to a 20% in energy. Despite a large impact of anharmonicity has been predicted in several high-pressure hydrides, here the superconducting critical temperature is barely affected by anharmonicity, as it is lowered from its harmonic 318 K value only to 300 K at 500 GPa. We attribute the small impact of anharmonicity on superconductivity to the absence of softened optical modes and the fairly uniform distribution of the electron-phonon coupling among the vibrational modes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHowever, in the analyzed pressure range we are still close to the dissociation/metalization pressure 23 and the problem is not as simple as one could imagine a priori.Fig. 2a shows the electronic band structure of I4 1 /amd hydrogen at 500 GPa. The bands present a huge dispersion, associated to the dominating kinetic term in the energies of the electronic states. The calculated band structure is not far from the free-electron approximation, the main difference being the band gaps opened at the border of the BZ and whenever band crossing occurs due to the interaction of the electrons with the proton lattice. It is interesting to point out that if we consider the independent electron approximation, just keeping the V e,p term that gives the electron-proton interaction in the V scf selfconsistent potential and neglecting the V H Hartree and V xc electron-electron interactions (see Appendix for details), the resulting bands match almost perfectly with the DFT ones. Therefore, we can conclude that main differences with the free-electron approximation are due to the large proton-electron interaction, and that the interaction between the electrons is not giving any significant contribution to the band structure.

However, typical examples are chemically unstable and lack intrasheet \u03c0-conjugation, thereby significantly limiting their applications. Here we report a chemically stable, electronically conjugated organic framework with topologically designed wire frameworks and open nanochannels, in which the \u03c0 conjugation-spans the two-dimensional sheets. Our framework permits inborn periodic ordering of conjugated chains in all three dimensions and exhibits a striking combination of properties: chemical stability, extended \u03c0-delocalization, ability to host guest molecules and hole mobility. We show that the \u03c0-conjugated organic framework is useful for high on-off ratio photoswitches and photovoltaic cells. Therefore, this strategy may constitute a step towards realizing ordered semiconducting porous materials for innovations based on two-dimensionally extended \u03c0 systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTwo-dimensional (2D) COFs are characterized by their periodically ordered columnar p arrays and aligned one-dimensional nanochannels  , which are rarely available in other molecular architectures. In addition to traditional boronate [7][8][9]11,[13][14][15][17][18][19][20][21]23,[25][26][27] and boroxine 7,10 linkages, hydrazone 12 , imine 16,22 and squaraine 24 linkages have been developed for the solvothermal synthesis of COFs. Especially, covalent triazine frameworks synthesized by the trimerization of nitrile units under ionothermal conditions in the presence of molten salt such as ZnCl 2 [30][31][32][33][34] or by microwave reaction 35 offer a molecular platform to construct carbon nitrideconjugated networks, which exhibit outstanding properties and functions.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nExploration of new linkage and new reaction for the synthesis of COFs is a key to achieve the further advancement of functional porous materials.By virtue of their three-dimensional orderings at the atomic scale, 2D COFs have shown a great potential to perform core functions in organic electronics such as light emission 9,10 , charge transfer and separation 23,27 , and semiconduction 9,10,17,[19][20][21]23,26,28,29 . However, typical COFs lack intrasheet p-conjugation and chemical stability, which significantly limit their practical utility. To address this shortcoming, a chemically stable yet fully pconjugated COF is highly desirable. Such a framework with threedimensionally ordered chain alignment may provide a solution for the long-standing daunting challenges in semiconducting polymer technology [36][37][38] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOur COFs introduce a new strategy and direction in the quest for high-performance-conjugated polymers and may pave a way for innovations and applications in fields from organic electronics to energy storage, and fuel cells.\nResultsSynthesis and characterization. Figure 1 shows the structure of a chemically stable, electronically p-conjugated COF (CS-COF; CS stands for conjugated and stable). We selected C 3 -symmetric triphenylene hexamine (TPHA) 57 and C 2 -symmetric tertbutylpyrene tetraone (PT) 58 as building blocks for the topological ring fusion reaction and prepared the crystalline phenazine-linked CS-COF in isolated yields of 86-90% under solvothermal conditions.

The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDynamic covalent self-assembly of mechanically interlocked molecules solely made from peptides\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHVSchro \u00a8der\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJLink\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/s41557-021-00770-7\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

A conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process: we call this approach reticular synthesis. This chemistry has yielded materials designed to have predetermined structures, compositions and properties. In particular, highly porous frameworks held together by strong metal-oxygen-carbon bonds and with exceptionally large surface area and capacity for gas storage have been prepared and their pore metrics systematically varied and functionalized. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHere we take selected examples to highlight the ideas involved, with emphasis on our own work on MOFs in which structural and thermal stability characterization have been combined with in-depth studies of surface area and gas sorption capacities. The subject of metal-organic frameworks has a long history, however, so we begin by giving some perspectives on the field.\nPerspectives and challengesThe Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) documents the crystal structures of more than 11,000 extended metal-organic compounds in which a metal ion or cluster has been linked by an organic moiety in which the linking functionality is a cyanide, pyridyl, phosphate or carboxylate. Of these, nearly 3,000 compounds have threedimensional (3D) structures and about double that number have 2D structures. MOFs composed of the first-row transition metals and organic links such as cyanide 15,16 , glutamate 17 , formate 18 , triazole 19 , oxalate 20 , 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylates 21 and squarates 22 have long been known.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA lthough the synthesis of new materials has long been recognized as the most essential element in advancing technology, it generally remains more of an art than a science-in that the discovery of new compounds has mostly been serendipitous, using methods referred to by critics as 'shake and bake', 'mix and wait' and 'heat and beat'. For much of the twentieth century, this worked well for the synthesis of important solid-state materials, and we expect that it will continue to yield interesting compounds. However, it is becoming increasingly urgent to produce materials designed to perform highly specific and cooperative functions 1,2 .Recent extensive research into the design and synthesis of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) has led to numerous practical and conceptual developments in that direction [3][4][5][6][7] . Specifically, the chemistry of MOFs has provided an extensive class of crystalline materials with high stability, tunable metrics, organic functionality, and porosity. Here we present some of the important developments that have shaped this rapidly growing field and propose a general conceptual framework, which serves as a useful tool in designing materials constructed from molecular building blocks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is different from retrosynthesis of organic compounds 10 , because the structural integrity and rigidity of the building blocks in reticular synthesis remain unaltered throughout the construction process-an important aspect that could help to realize fully the benefits of design in crystalline solid-state frameworks. Similarly, reticular synthesis should be distinguished from supramolecular assembly 11 , because in the former, building blocks are linked by strong bonds throughout the crystal.In this context, it is worth noting that a plethora of extended structures successfully prepared by copolymerization of metal ions with organic links have been reported and reviewed under the rubric of 'crystal engineering', a term which has mutated somewhat over the years and which is now rather broadly defined [12][13][14] . We use the more precise term reticular synthesis (or chemistry) to describe the logical approach to the synthesis of robust materials with predesigned building blocks, extended structures, and properties. Thus, it might be considered a subclass of crystal engineering.Research in the area of MOFs and, to a lesser extent, inorganic frameworks, has recently progressed far enough to provide examples which show the feasibility of the building-block approach and the scope of reticular synthesis.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We identified a mechanism of intrinsic multi-drug resistance based on the survival of a tumor cell subpopulation. Treatment with various drugs, including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (OXPHOS) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a two-tiered approach combining anti-cancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis concept is gaining prominence in the field of cancer research, with several studies reporting the enrichment of quiescent cancer stem cells after chemotherapy. For example, slow-cycling glioblastoma cells survive temozolomide treatment (Chen et al., 2012). Accordingly, if cell subpopulations can act as major drivers for tumor maintenance and mediate universal therapeutic resistance, approaches that target this phenotype could increase the efficacy of treatment regimens and reduce the risk of melanoma relapses.We have recently demonstrated that, even within highly proliferative melanomas, there is a slow-cycling cell subpopulation that is identifiable by the expression of the histone 3 K4 demethylase JARID1B (Roesch et al., 2005(Roesch et al., , 2010)).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe histone demethylase KDM5b/JARID1b plays a role in cell fate decisions by blocking terminal differentiation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBKDey\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLStalker\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tASchnerch\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMBhatia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJTaylor-Papidimitriou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCWynder\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMol.

Here, we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics, and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial genetic evidence supporting the concept that lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications can be used for prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n10c).\nDiscussionIn concert, we have exploited natural genetic variation to test a collaborative model for enhancer selection and function, and conversely explored the ability of this model to explain strain-specific differences in transcription factor binding and epigenetic features associated with functional enhancers in macrophages. These studies provide genetic evidence that lineage-determining transcription factors are dependent on collaborative binding to variably spaced DNA recognition motifs in order to select enhancers and enable binding of signaldependent transcription factors. Notably, the variable motif distances observed at co-bound LDTF loci suggests that collaborative binding does not generally require direct proteinprotein interactions between the involved transcription factors. The proposed hierarchical LDTF collaborative model provides a conceptual framework for prioritization of non-coding disease-associated regulatory variants. While all cells express hundreds of transcription factors, a large fraction of functional enhancers (~70% in macrophages) are characterized by collaborative interactions involving relatively small sets of lineage determining transcription factors (e.g., PU.1, AP-1 and C/EBPs). The requirement for collaborative binding interactions provides an explanation for why transcription factor binding is lost at sites where mutations do not occur in the cognate recognition motif.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, by collecting a relatively limited set of genomic binding data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications, this analytical approach can be exploited to explain a greater extent of variation in enhancer selection and function than previously possible 7,10 . To further increase the specificity and sensitivity for detecting functional variations, identification of transcription factor motifs that permit binding but diverge from the consensus PWM, i.e. \"weak\" motifs, needs to be improved, as such sites are more likely to be affected by mutation 29,30 . In addition, transcription factors less abundant than LDTFs likely play individually small but collectively significant roles. At a larger scale, non-cisacting, long-range epigenetic mechanisms may also be important for enhancer selection. A major goal for the future will be to extend these approaches to understanding natural genetic variation associated with human disease.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPrioritization of functional intergenic variants remains challenging due in part to an incomplete understanding of how regulation is achieved at the nucleotide level in different cell types and environmental contexts [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] . While recent studies have described important roles for lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs), also referred to as pioneer factors or master regulators, in selecting cell type-specific enhancers [12][13][14][15] , the sequence determinants that guide their binding are poorly understood. Previous findings in macrophages and B cells suggest a hierarchical model of regulatory function 6 , where a relatively small set of LDTFs collaboratively compete with nucleosomes to bind DNA in a cell type-specific manner (Fig 1a, i->ii). The binding of these factors is proposed to 'prime' DNA by initiating deposition of histone modifications that are associated with cis-active regulatory regions (Fig. 1a, ii -> iii) and enable concurrent or subsequent binding of signal-dependent transcription factors that direct regulated gene expression (Fig. 1a, iii ->iv) 6,13,15,16 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

But their ultra-short lifetime, typically 100 fs or less, and correspondingly short transport length-scale in the nanometre range constrain real-space investigations. Here we report variable temperature and voltage measurements of the nonlocal manipulation of adsorbed molecules on the Si(111)-7 \u00d7 7 surface in the scanning tunnelling microscope. The range of the nonlocal effect increases with temperature and, at constant temperature, is invariant over a wide range of electron energies. The measurements probe, in real space, the underlying hot electron dynamics on the 10 nm scale and are well described by a two-dimensional diffusive model with a single decay channel, consistent with 2-photon photo-emission (2PPE) measurements of the real time dynamics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTypically carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering brings a population of hot carriers into a Fermi-Dirac distribution with some characteristic hot electron temperature T e within 10 s of fs (refs 43,51,52). We inject at currents of B100 pA and therefore have, on average, one-electron injected every 1 ns. Given the 180 fs lifetime of the electrons within the 2.0 eV state, we rule out carrier-carrier scattering. Further carrier-phonon scattering brings the mean energy of the electron distribution down to ultimately thermalize with the lattice. In our case, this carrierphonon scattering appears to occur within the high-lying 2.0 eV state since we have a temperature dependence of the nonlocal range. Subsequent scattering, here in a time of 180 fs, removes the electron from this state to lower lying states. There is therefore a competition between electron-phonon scattering thermalizing the hot-electron within the 2.0 eV state and scattering that electron into a lower lying state.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe range of the nonlocal effect increases with temperature and, at constant temperature, is invariant over a wide range of electron energies. The measurements probe, in real space, the underlying hot electron dynamics on the 10 nm scale and are well described by a two-dimensional diffusive model with a single decay channel, consistent with 2-photon photo-emission (2PPE) measurements of the real time dynamics.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nT he dynamics of hot electrons, those with energies perhaps hundreds of times greater than the available thermal energy, is central to understanding the properties of many electronic devices. For example, they contribute to leakage currents across CMOS transistors and may fundamentally limit their downsizing [1][2][3] and they are intrinsic to solar cells, where high energy photons generate hot electrons that consequently generate a photocurrent [4][5][6] . Hot electrons can also, for example, be induced through plasmonics [7][8][9] and offer a route to instigate non-thermal chemical reactions 10 . Hot electron charge transport is thus the subject of major scientific research, both experimentally and theoretically [11][12][13][14] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBut the experiments are constrained by the ultra-short lifetime of hot electrons, typically 100 fs or less, and hence their corresponding transport length-scale of a few nm (refs 15,16). Direct pump-probe measurements with ultra-fast lasers typically provide little or no spatial information. Recently a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) coupled to terahertz radiation reported 0.5 ps and 2 nm resolution 17 . Here we employ the technique of STM-induced nonlocal atomic manipulation on an atomically precise surface to show that the nonlocal effect is a direct manifestation of hot electron dynamics.

They are predicted to exist in a vortex core of superconducting topological insulators. However, it is extremely difficult to distinguish them experimentally from other quasiparticle states for the tiny energy difference between Majorana fermions and these states, which is beyond the energy resolution of most available techniques. Here, we circumvent the problem by systematically investigating the spatial profile of the Majorana mode and the bound quasiparticle states within a vortex in Bi(2)Te(3) films grown on a superconductor NbSe(2). While the zero bias peak in local conductance splits right off the vortex center in conventional superconductors, it splits off at a finite distance \u223c20 nm away from the vortex center in Bi(2)Te(3). This unusual splitting behavior has never been observed before and could be possibly due to the Majorana fermion zero mode. While the Majorana mode is destroyed by the interaction between vortices, the zero bias peak splits as a conventional superconductor again. This work provides self-consistent evidences of Majorana fermions and also suggests a possible route to manipulating them. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAnomalous Zero-Bias Conductance Peak in a Nb -InSb Nanowire -Nb Hybrid Device\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMTDeng\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1021/nl303758w\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNano Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t6414\n\t\t\t2012\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tZero-bias peaks and splitting in an Al-InAs nanowire topological superconductor as a signature of Majorana fermions\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADas\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/nphys2479\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

Several transport measurements revealed a signature of MFs, i.e., a sharp zero-bias peak in differential conductance spectrum, in various NW/SC junctions [10][11][12][13] . In InSb/Nb junction, an unconventional fractional a.c. Josephson effect was observed and attributed to the existence of MFs 14 . However, alternative explanations of these transport results based on disorder and/or band bending in the NWs have been proposed [15][16][17][18] . As yet, no conclusive evidence has been established for the existence of MF.In contrary, the disorder alone is unlikely to induce a zero-bias peak in a TI/SC heterostructure, which can be used to detect MFs without complications mentioned above.Proximity effect induced superconductivity in a TI surface has been demonstrated in several TI/SC heterostructures [19][20][21][22] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs the field reaches 0.18T, the zero-bias peak becomes much weaker. In a conventional s-wave SC the vortex density is proportional to the magnetic field below a critical field H c2 . A single vortex structure is not sensitive to the external field and the LDOS near a vortex core is essentially unchanged as the field increases. The bound states of a vortex in NbSe 2 do not show the abrupt change when the magnetic field increases from 0.025T to 1.25T (Fig. 3B). The dramatic change in the zero-bias peak intensity in 5QL Bi 2 Te 3 film is interpreted as the result of the coupling between adjacent vortices. At a small field, the distance between vortices is much larger than the vortex size, so the interaction between the vortices can be neglected. As the field increases to 0.18T, the distance between two adjacent vortices is reduced to about 110nm (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the higher magnetic field suppresses the superconducting gap and coherence length becomes longer, so the interaction between the vortices becomes strong enough to destroy the Majorana modes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Key uncertainties in kilonova modeling include the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products\u2014non-thermal beta-particles, alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays\u2014and the efficiency with which their kinetic energy is absorbed by the ejecta. The radioactive energy emitted, along with its thermalization efficiency, sets the luminosity budget and is therefore crucial for predicting kilonova light curves. We outline uncertainties in the radioactivity, describe the processes by which the decay products transfer energy to the ejecta, and calculate time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We determine the net thermalization efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process yields\u2014in particular, the production of \n-decaying translead nuclei\u2014and on ejecta mass, velocity, and magnetic fields. We incorporate our results into detailed radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated kilonova light curve predictions. Thermalization effects reduce kilonova luminosities by a factor of roughly 2 at peak, and by an order of magnitude at later times (15 days or more after explosion). We present analytic fits to time-dependent thermalization efficiencies, which can be used to improve light curve models. We revisit the putative kilonova that accompanied gamma-ray burst 130603B, and estimate the mass ejected in that event. We find later time kilonova light curves can be significantly impacted by alpha-decay from translead isotopes; data at these times may therefore be diagnostic of ejecta abundances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor our fiducial model, the predicted luminosity is lower by a factor of \uf0882 at peak, and by 10 days is lower by an factor of 5.18.

The curves are dimmer in the newer models, reflecting the reduction in thermalized energy, but relationships between the light curves in the various bands is mostly unchanged, so the kilonova colors are preserved.Figure 19.

The reason for CO2 promotion is not sufficiently understood at the particle level due to the catalyst complexity and the high demands of characterization under true reaction conditions. Herein, we applied operando synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and modulated-excitation infrared spectroscopy on a commercial catalyst to gain insights into its morphology and surface chemistry. These studies unveiled that Cu and ZnO agglomerate and ZnO particles flatten under CO/H2 and/or CO2 /H2 . Under the optimal CO/CO2 /H2 mixture, sintering is prevented and ZnO crystals adopt an elongated shape due to the minimal presence of the H2 O byproduct, enhancing the water-gas shift activity and thus the methanol production. Our results provide a rationale to the CO2 promotion emphasizing the importance of advanced analytical methods to establish structure-performance relations in heterogeneous catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[6] As af irst step in this direction, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD), and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at (sub)ambient pressure have been applied over Cu supported on ZnO,e videncing that copper forms disc-like particles wetted by Zn atoms under strongly reducing gas mixtures (CO/H 2 )a nd spherical particles in the presence of H 2 Oa nd/or CO 2 .

[8] In addition, key intermediates of CO 2 hydrogenation could be detected on an industrial Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) at 3.0 MPa and 373-473 K.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[16] We therefore explain the top of the cycle (Figure 1) mainly as aresult of the depleted contacts between Cu particles and polar ZnO facets due to the elongation of the latter along the hexagonal prism axis (0001) under the optimal CO/CO 2 /H 2 mixture boosting the WGS and consequently the CO 2 promotion.In conclusion, our study established correlations between the Cu and ZnO particle size and morphology,t he reaction mechanism, and the activity of acommercial Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst upon methanol synthesis under various gas compositions and industrial conditions.O perando SXRPD elucidated that Cu particles retained their cuboctahedral shape but sintered under CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 .T his phenomenon was associated with the segregation of Cu from ZnO upon CO hydrogenation and with the presence of H 2 Ou pon CO 2 hydrogenation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[5] As indicated recently,t his reaction appears to be favored over the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) on ac omposite obtained by mechanical mixing of large particles of Cu and Al 2 O 3 with ZnO in aplate-like shape with respect to the case of am ixture containing rod-like ZnO crystallites, [5d] based on the stronger electronic interactions between ZnO and Cu in the former catalyst. However,the relevance of the structure-function relationships derived in these works is limited by the use of model materials and/or ex situ characterization. Indeed, it has conclusively been demonstrated that only in situ and operando methods enable the detection of dynamic changes in the structure of heterogeneous catalysts at work which may be linked to the reaction mechanism.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The adsorption mechanism of water on MOFs is known. Water initially adsorbs at specific hydrophilic sites (uncoordinated metal sites, OH-groups on inorganic clusters, or functional groups on the organic ligand). Subsequently, additional water clusters around these initially adsorbed water molecules, after which the pores are filled via volume filling (d p < D c ) or capillary condensation (d p > D c ). In silico prediction of water adsorption in MOFs is deemed not yet mature enough for accurate selection of MOF structures.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn the following sections, MOF performance will be compared to selected benchmark materials to further elucidate the possible benefits of using MOFs for the application at hand. To do so, a more detailed understanding of an ideal heat pump cycle is required (section 6.2). On the basis of this cycle, the governing equations of the thermodynamic model can subsequently be described (section 6.3). This model requires some thermodynamic properties as input. Their determination and/or estimation is briefly mentioned (section 6.4), followed by a detailed discussion of the results (section 6.5).\nSelected Working PairsThe MOFs that show promise for application in adsorptiondriven allocation of heat and cold are listed in Table 6.

[504][505][506] In short, MOFs with water as working fluid show improved thermodynamic efficiency and volumetric adsorption capacity in comparison to commercially available benchmark materials for adsorption-driven allocation of heat and cold. MOF potential is further strengthened by the availability of low temperature, environmentally benign, and even solvent-free synthesis protocols and the possibility of synthesizing these materials directly on heat exchanger surfaces. MOFs thus have a bright future for application in adsorption-driven heat pumps and chillers.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[3] In spite of versatile advantages of porous MOFs, which include tailor-made pore structures and controllable porosity by change of organic ligands and metal subunits, [2] most MOFs suffer from a lack of hydrothermal stability. [4] Structural damage to a MOF caused by moisture at processing conditions or during regeneration will strongly limit the utilization of a MOF as a sorbent for industrial applications. [4] Conversely, highly porous MOFs with good hydrothermal stability represent candidates for industrially useful water sorbents.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis suggests that most of the water molecules are physisorbed on MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe) with a low host-guest interaction (close to the energy of liquefaction) except for the coordinated water molecules, allowing for the low-temperature desorption of water.  designed for a prototype simulation of a household desiccanttype dehumidifier than that with a zeolite rotor, which is commercially available. The detailed results will be published elsewhere.In conclusion, we have unambiguously demonstrated that hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks, MIL-100 and MIL-101 with mesoporous cages behave as advanced water adsorbents applicable to energy-efficient dehumidification. Elaborate investigations of their water sorption properties have shown huge sorption uptakes even at 40 \u00b0C as well as high desorption rates below 80 \u00b0C together with hydrothermal stability. In comparison with the water sorption behaviors of commercial adsorbents such as zeolite NaX, SAPO-34, and silica gel, the improved performance in MIL-100 and MIL-101 demonstrated here suggests commercially viable applications including energyefficient desiccant dehumidification and fresh water production.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nCubic mesoporous metal(III) di-or tri-carboxylates with hierachical pore structures labeled MIL-101(Cr), MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr), and MIL-100(Al) (MIL stands for Materials of Institut Lavoisier) using trivalent octahedral metals and the simplest aromatic carboxylates such as terepthalate and trimesate have been discovered. [5,6] Based on this requirement, the exceptional hydrothermal stability and large sorption uptakes known for MIL-101 and MIL-100 encouraged us to assess their applicability for water sorption applications. [5,6] Despite studies done on water adsorption in MOFs, [7] reports dealing with MOFs as water adsorbents are still scarce [8] and there is a particular need to evaluate their low temperature desorption properties, i.e., below 80 \u00b0C for application to energy-efficient dehumidication systems.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

S7), in line with previous findings of a positive correlation between the dendritic spine density of memory engram cells and memory expression triggered by natural recall cues [citation 25].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Labelling and optical erasure of synaptic memory traces in the motor cortex \nAbstract: Dendritic spines are the major loci of synaptic plasticity and are considered as possible structural correlates of memory. Nonetheless, systematic manipulation of specific subsets of spines in the cortex has been unattainable, and thus, the link between spines and memory has been correlational. We developed a novel synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2d). Notably, synaptic fluorescence of AS-PaRac1 just after training (0 day) strongly correlated with the change in spine size upon training (Fig. 2f). It is unlikely that the accumulation of AS-PaRac1 caused the potentiation or labelled the spines primed for potentiation such as for the 'tagged synapse' 35,36 , because the initial quantity of AS-PaRac1 before learning (-1 day) did not correlate with the change in spine size after learning (Fig. 2g). Analysis of AS-PaRac1 puncta in the dendritic shaft suggested that the majority of AS-PaRac1 signal was located in the dendritic spines, and the labelling of shaft synapses was negligible (Extended Data Fig. 5). When we set the threshold of AS-PaRac1 at 1 a.u. (Fig. 2f, green shaded area, 0 day), AS-PaRac1 detected spine formation and enlargement with sensitivities of 83 \u00b1 7.9% and 69 \u00b1 3.0% (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean), respectively (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2h), whereas labelling in other spine types was 2.3 \u00b1 0.12%. Since Arc::AS-PaRac1 was induced only in the AS-PaRac1-positive neuron, the labelling properties in the AS-PaRac1-positive neuron was also calculated, which turned out that the sensitivities for formation and enlargement were 94 \u00b1 2.7% and 95 \u00b1 4.8%, respectively, while the false labelling in other spine types was 12.9 \u00b1 4.2 % (306 spines, 6 AS-PaRac1positive neurons in 3 mice). Therefore, AS-PaRac1 is a reliable marker of the potentiated spines in vivo.Next, we performed wide-view mapping of task-evoked potentiation using this probe (Fig. 2i, learning period), and we found that the task-evoked potentiation was elicited in 2.3 \u00b1 0.13% of spines and 16.4 \u00b1 2.8% of neurons in the imaged area. We tracked an almost whole image of neurons (Extended Data Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n4d).To characterize the synaptic retention of AS-PaRac1 for photoactivation (PA) experiments in vivo, the individual spines that acquired AS-PaRac1 were tracked, and were separately iconized from the day of AS-PaRac1 appearance (Fig. 2c andi). We noticed that persistence of synaptic AS-PaRac1 and the structural potentiation markedly varied among spines: some were preserved beyond 1 day after training (Fig. 2c, dendrite #1), while others disappeared (Fig. 2c, dendrites #2 and #3). Importantly, the structural potentiation and AS-PaRac1 labelling triggered during the 'Learning' period were more likely to be preserved than those triggered during the training-free period (Fig. 2j, 'Before' and 'After-1'). Consistently, longitudinal imaging of the structurally potentiated spines revealed that the majority of those with the retention of AS-PaRac1 for 24 h maintained structural potentiation for at least 48 h (Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Besides being easy and cheap, the catalyst synthesis is flexible enough to allow further optimization of the porosity and surface area.To date, the true dependence of the structure on the reactivity remains unclear, and further investigations are needed. However, as a comparable material synthesized at higher temperatures (1000 \u00b0C) supports the four-electron process, certain assumptions can be made: (1) Consistent with simulations of Okamoto, 22 an increased nitrogen content may favor the two-electron process. (2) The \"radical\" character of nitrogen-bound carbon, which is essential for the two-electron process, 21 may be more pronounced for meso-BMP-800 because of the lower degree of delocalization.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n3,4 Therefore continuous research on improving the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide is carried out, [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] but electrocatalysts still suffer from high costs, limited selectivity or low activity. We herein show ionic liquid-derived mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon to be a highly active, cheap, and selective metal-free catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide with the potential to establish a safe, sustainable, and cheap flow-reactor-based production method.With the synthesis of novel mesoporous metal-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in hydrogen fuel cells with activities in basic media comparable to those of commercial platinum catalysts, we and others could recently endorse the thesis of highly ORR-active nitrogen-doped carbon. 13,14 However, our nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts also possess considerably high catalytic activity in the acidic media of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). 13 Mechanistic analysis of the electrochemical process showed that the number of transferred electrons was not always four, as theoretically expected for the complete reduction of O 2 to H 2 O; in some cases, lower, uneven values were calculated.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAdditionally, the method is very inexpensive (regarding electricity 2.4 EUR cents kg H 2 O 2 -1 at 10 EUR cents kWh -1 industry price), while costs for the transport of liquid hazardous H 2 O 2 could be avoided. As such, precise attribution of the catalytic activity to a specific binding site seems rather speculative. Besides the importance of an increased nitrogen content retaining sufficient conductivity (see ref 22), another possible factor affecting the reactivity is the degree of graphitization. Here, the polarizability of the graphitic layers should influence the adsorption properties, while the elongation of the conjugated \u03c0 system could determine crucial electronic properties. As the radical character of nitrogen-bound carbon may support the two-electron process, less-conjugated \u03c0 systems should be more favored for hydrogen peroxide synthesis. 21 However, nitrogen-doped carbon materials have also received great attention as support materials for metal and metal alloy catalysts, for example, in the methanol oxidation reaction or oxygen reduction to water.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

NaChBac inactivation kinetics show strong, bell-shaped voltage dependence with characteristic time constants ranging from approximately 50 ms at depolarized voltages to a maximum of approximately 100 s at the inactivation midpoint. Activation and inactivation parameters for four different covalently linked tandem dimer or tandem tetramer constructs were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type channel. Point mutations in the outer part of the pore revealed an important influence of the S195 residue on the process of inactivation. For two mutants (S195D and S195E), the maximal and minimal rates of inactivation observed were increased by approximately 2.5-fold, and the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, compared to the wild-type channel. Our data suggest that pore vestibule structure is an important determinant of NaChBac inactivation, whereas the inactivation mechanism is independent of the number of free cytoplasmic N- and C-termini in the functional channel. In these respects, NaChBac inactivation resembles C-type or slow inactivation modes observed in other voltage-gated K and Na channels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nINTRODUCTIONOne of the common properties of voltage-gated channels is their ability to inactivate in response to membrane depolarization. Two general mechanisms of inactivation have been characterized. The first mechanism is usually typified by relatively fast inactivation during a sustained depolarization, effected at the molecular level by a ''ball and chain'' (1)(2)(3)(4)(5) or ''hinged-lid'' mechanism (6). Molecular mechanisms of this type of inactivation, called N-type inactivation, have been studied in detail in K and Na channels. The groups responsible for this type of inactivation are localized at the cytoplasmic side of the channel. For example, in Shaker K-channel, the N-terminal region of the channel plays the role of the ''ball'', which occludes the inner part of the pore after channel activation and thus closes the channel (7). A similar mechanism has been described for Na channels.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA similar mechanism has been described for Na channels. In this case channel block is probably provided by the III-IV interdomain linker latched by a triplet of hydrophobic residues (IFM motif) to form a hinged lid (8).A second type of inactivation process, usually with significantly slower kinetics, has been observed in a number of channels (9)(10)(11). This type of inactivation is called C-type or slow inactivation, with yet a third inactivation process (P-type) also recognized in potassium channels (12). Although the detailed mechanisms of slow inactivation processes are incompletely understood, it is believed that rearrangement of the pore, rather than motion of a cytoplasmic region of the channel, is likely to play a central role (13)(14)(15).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUltra-slow inactivation in m1 Na 1 channels is produced by a structural rearrangement of the outer vestibule\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHTodt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSCDudleyJr\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWKyle\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRJFrench\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHAFozzard\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBiophys.

ZnO nanorods were grown on the ZnO seed layer from solution, and their diameters and lengths were controlled by precursor concentration and growth time. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite infiltrated ZnO nanorods showed a power conversion efficiency of 11.13% with short-circuit current density Jsc of 20.08 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage Voc of 991 mV and fill factor of 0.56. Square spectral feature of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was observed, where EQE exceeded 80% in almost the entire wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, and the integrated current density of 20.03 mA/cm2 calculated from EQE data was in good agreement with the observed Jsc. Compared to the perfect spectral response of ZnO nanorods, a perovskite solar cell based on TiO2 nanorods exhibited an integrated current density (16 mA/cm2) much lower than the measured Jsc (20.9 mA/cm2). In addition, time-limited photocurrent response under 530 and 700 nm monochromatic beams at 10 Hz showed that device signal amplitude, associated with charge collection, was rapidly saturated for the ZnO nanorod-based device whereas charge collection was not fully detected for the TiO2 nanorod-based device because of slow collection rate. The current results suggest that ZnO nanorod is an effective charge collection system in CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTwo-step spin coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in the 1 \u03bcm long TiO 2 nanorod film results in J sc of 20.92 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 869 mV, FF of 0.55, and PCE of 10.02%, which is higher than the previous result for the similar TiO 2 length 9 because of the different coating procedure for the perovskite as mentioned previously. Compared to the ZnO  nanorod, the slightly lower PCE is due to lower V oc , associated with lower conduction band position for the rutile TiO 2 structure and/or enhanced recombination. It is also noted that absolute EQE is lower in spite of high J sc , and as a result, the integrated J sc of about 16 mA/cm 2 is far lower than the measured J sc at 1 sun illumination. In addition, APCE in Figure 9d is lower than that of ZnO (Figure 7d) in spite of similar LHE in Figure 9c.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n4 Recent progress pushed PCE of perovskite solar cell up to 15%. 5,6 Thanks to the high open-circuit voltage V oc of perovskite solar cell exceeding 1 V, a PCE of 20% is predicted from perovskite solar cell, 7,8 which indicates that organometal halide perovskite is a very promising solar cell material.There are two branches in developing perovskite solar cell; one is based on electron-injecting nanostructured oxide layer, and the other is based on nonelectron-injecting scaffold layer (meso-superstructure) or pn junction type planar structure. For the case of the electron-injecting oxide system, except for the TiO 2 nanoparticles, one-dimensional TiO 2 [9][10][11] and ZnO 12,13 were investigated. Although electron transport in ZnO was observed to be faster than that in TiO 2 , 13 photovoltaic performances of ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells were inferior to those of TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cells.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFigure 9 shows J-V curve, EQE and APCE spectra of TiO 2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell along with LHE of perovskite coated TiO 2 nanorod film, and cross-sectional SEM images of bare TiO 2 nanorods and full cell. Length of the solution-grown TiO 2 nanorods is about 1 \u03bcm, and their width is 80-90 nm, as can be seen in Figure 9e. TiO 2 compact layer is clearly seen between TiO 2 nanorods and FTO. A thin spiro-MeOTAD HTM layer is formed over the TiO 2 nanorod film (Figure 9f).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We report that single iron sites embedded in a silica matrix enable direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane, exclusively to ethylene and aromatics. The reaction is initiated by catalytic generation of methyl radicals, followed by a series of gas-phase reactions.

Light olefins, which are key chemical feedstocks, are currently made from methanol, which itself is made through multistage catalytic transformations via syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) (2,3), although there is also ongoing research to convert syngas directly to light olefins (4,5). However, in all such approaches, either CO or H 2 is needed to remove oxygen from CO, resulting in a carbon-atom utilization efficiency below 50%. Despite their low efficiency, high capital and production costs, and enormous CO 2 emissions, syngas routes dominate current and near-term industrial practices for natural gas conversion (6, 7).Direct conversion of CH 4 is potentially more economical and environmentally friendly but is challenging because CH 4 exhibits high C-H bond strength (434 kJ/mol), negligible electron affinity, large ionization energy, and low polarizability (8).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1126/science.1253150\u2022Source:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe efficient use of natural gas will require catalysts that can activate the first C-H bond of methane while suppressing complete dehydrogenation and avoiding overoxidation.

The presence of ethane substantially enhanced methane conversion (fig. S2) ( 22), and ethane is almost completely converted, although a small amount of coke is formed at 1173 K and a space velocity of 4.84 liter gcat -1 h -1 .The unprecedented efficiency of the catalytically initiated CH 4 conversion process is attributed to the high activity of the coordinatively unsaturated iron sites toward the C-H bond of CH 4 (28,29). The isolated nature of these sites, as evidenced by sub-angstrom-resolution high-angle annular-dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), precludes surface C-C coupling and, hence, coke formation.

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread pathogen responsible for generally asymptomatic and persistent infections in healthy people. Recent evidence indicates that HCMV gene products are expressed in over 90% of malignant type glioblastomas (GBM). In addition, the HCMV Immediate Early-1 protein (IE1) is expressed in >90% of tumors analyzed.\nMethods: RhoA, RhoB and RhoC were individually depleted in U373MG glioblastoma cells as well as U373MG cells stably expressing the HCMV IE1 protein (named U373MG-IE1 cells) shRNA lentivirus vectors. Cell proliferation assays, migration as well as wound-healing assays were performed in uninfected and HCMV-infected cells.\nResults: The depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC protein resulted in significant alterations in the morphology of the uninfected cells, which were further enhanced by the cytopathic effect caused by HCMV. Furthermore, in the absence or presence of HCMV, the knockdown of RhoB and RhoC proteins decreased the proliferation rate of the parental and the IE1-expressing glioblastoma cells, whereas the knockdown of RhoA protein in the HCMV infected cell lines restored their proliferation rate. In addition, wound healing assays in U373MG cells revealed that depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC differentially reduced their migration rate, even in the presence or the absence of HCMV.\nConclusion: Collectively, these data show for the first time a differential implication of Rho GTPases in morphology, proliferation rate and motility of human glioblastoma cells during HCMV infection, further supporting an oncomodulatory role of HCMV depending on the Rho isoforms' state. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe above observations are consistent with earlier studies depleting the same Rho isoforms both in prostate and breast cancer cells [59,62]. The overexpression of HCMV IE1 protein alone did not bring about any additional effect regarding the phenotype of the Rho knockdown cells, thus excluding any direct modulatory role of IE1 on cell morphology. The morphological changes induced in the glioblastoma cells after RhoA and RhoC depletion remained evident, even in the context of HCMV infection, despite the cytopathic effect caused by the virus, highlighting an imposing role Rho GTPases on cell shape. Although Rho GTPases have been shown to enhance malignant transformation and proliferation rate, RhoB is rather assumed as a negative regulator of these processes [63,64]. However, recent data have shown that RhoB expression is induced under conditions such as DNA damage, or treatment with growth factors or cytokines, suggesting that under particular circumstances, RhoB may favor towards human malignancy, including glioblastoma tumors [65,66].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn this study, we display that downregulation of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC proteins in infected glioblastoma cells decreases their proliferation rate and their migration status and inhibitsFig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

The expression of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC were determined in (A) U373MG cells and (B) U373MG-IE1 cells by Western Blot from whole protein extracts derived from each cell line after transduction with the indicated TRIPZ shRNA lentivirus vectors, induction with doxycycline and selection with puromycin. Actin served as loading control.\u03a4he stable expression of IE1 in U373MG-IE1 cells was also confirmed. (C) U373MG cells, transduced with the lentivirus empty vector and induced with doxyxyclynine, were infected with the recombinant HCMV AD169/IE2-EGFP virus at MOI=3 pfu/cell. Cells were fixed 8 hours after infection and nuclei were stained with DAPI.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn the present study, we show that when RhoB is silenced, both parental and their derivative-IE1 cells show a reduction in spread area compared to the RhoA or RhoC knockdown cells, an effect which has attributed to subsequent reduction of total surface levels of b1 integrin [67,68]. Moreover, in the presence of HCMV, an increased number of cellular projections was formed, a phenomenon which has also been observed in HCMV infected primary HFF cells, particularly at the late stages of lytic infection [49]. These findings further corroborate the idea of a key role for RhoB in the regulation of cell shape.Regarding to the proliferation rate of uninfected parental and IE1-expressing glioblastoma cells, the deficiency of RhoB or RhoC resulted in a significant inhibition of their proliferation state while RhoA deficiency reduced the cell growth of both U373MG and U373MG-IE1 cells to a lower degree. This difference reflects the evidence that RhoA regulates actin polymerization, cell adhesion and myosin activity [7,69] whereas RhoB and RhoC control cell survival and cell proliferation, respectively [70].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Research has mainly focused on increasing the crystallinity of conjugated polymers as a strategy to improve the long-range charge transport properties. Here, we demonstrate that local aggregation over very few chains is a sufficient mesoscopic structure to ensure high mobility, with charge transport mainly occurring along the polymer backbones, and that extended crystallinity is not necessary. These results provide an explanation for the high mobilities observed in seemingly disordered polymers and set molecular-design guidelines for next-generation conjugated polymers. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nResearch should be shifted to the molecular level with a focus on the interchain coupling in the aggregates and/or the design of molecules that afford delocalization and minimize trapping (38).\nMaterials and MethodsOFET Device Fabrication. Corning Eagle 2000 glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min each, following by drying with nitrogen. Source-drain electrodes patterns were fabricated using a conventional evaporation procedure through metal shadow mask (channel length 30 \u03bcm, channel width 500 \u03bcm). Five-nanometer-thick Ti was used as adhesion layer of the Au electrodes on glass. The semiconducting polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) (ActivInk N2200; Polyera Inc.) and PS (molecular weight 100 kDa; Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 1,2dichlorobenzene, both at the concentration of 8 mg/mL. P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS solutions were obtained by mixing the two above-mentioned solutions in volume ratios.

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe actual impossibility of cloning photons, shown below, thus prohibits superluminal communication by this scheme. That such a scheme must fail for some reason despite the well-established existence of long-range quantum correlations 6 on an incoming photon with polarization state Is):IAo)ls)-+ IA.)lss) (1)Here lAo) is the 'ready' state of the apparatus, and lAs) is its final state, which mayor may not depend on the polarization of the original photon.

Let us suppose that such an amplification can in fact be accomplished for the vertical polarization It) and for the horizontal polarization 1-). That is,(2)  According to quantum mechanics this transformation should be representable by a linear (in fact unitary) operator.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIf it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine Its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters\u2022. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.Note that if photons could be cloned, a plausible argument could be made for the possibility of faster-than-light communication 2 \u2022 It is well known that for certain non-separably correlated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of photons, once an observer has made a polarization measurement (say, vertical versus horizontal) on one member of the pair, the other one, which may be far away, can be for all purposes of prediction regarded as having the same polarization 3\u2022 If this second photon could be replicated and its precise polarization measured as above, it would be possible to ascertain whether, for example, the first photon had been subjected to a measurement of linear or circular polarization. In this way the first observer would be able to transmit information faster than light by encoding his message into his choice of measurement.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n299 28 October 1982Milonni (unpublished work) has shown that the process of stimulated emission does not lead to quantum amplification, because if there is stimulated emission there must also be-with equal probability in the case of one incoming photon-spontaneous emission, and the polarization of a spontaneously emitted photon is entirely independent of the polarization of the original.It is conceivable that a more sophisticated amplifying apparatus could get around Milonni's argument. We have therefore presented the above simple argument, based on the linearity of quantum mechanics, to show that no apparatus, however complicated, can amplify an arbitrary polarization.We stress that the question of replicating individual photons is of practical interest. It is obviously closely related to the The study of supernovae is hampered by an insufficient knowledge of the initial stellar mass for individual supernova. Because of large uncertainties in estimating both the total mass of a remnant (including the pulsar or black hole) and any mass loss during the pre-supernova stages, the main sequence mass of the progenitor cannot be accurately determined from observations alone. To calculate an initial mass, one must rely on a combination of both theory and observation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we review recent progress in this field that demonstrates great potential of PFM for the investigation of static and dynamic properties of ferroelectric domains, nanofabrication and lithography, local functional control, and structural imaging in a variety of inorganic and organic materials, including piezoelectrics, semiconductors, polymers, biomolecules, and biological systems. Future pathways for PFM application in high-density data storage, nanofabrication, and spectroscopy are discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n11 Further experiments in a wide variety of relaxor systems [31][32][33][34][35] established PFM as a unique method that allows  access to many otherwise unreachable phenomena, including the grain size effect, 33,34 local variability of the correlation length (Figure 6), 33 the role of nanodomains in the macroscopic piezoresponse, 31 bias-induced phase transitions, 32,36 and domain nucleation. 37\nPFM Imaging of Functional MaterialsCoupling between electrical and mechanical phenomena is common in a wide range of inorganic and organic materials, including piezoelectrics, semiconductors, polymers, biomolecules, and biological systems. The ability of PFM to probe electromechanical coupling on the nanometer scale opens a new approach to the delineation of local structure and functionality of these materials. Recently, PFM has been extensively used to study domain structures in polar III-V nitrides and biopolymers, as summarized in the text that follows.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCoupling between electric fields and mechanical strain underpins a broader range of phenomena in ferroelectrics and other polar materials. This article highlights recent examples in which PFM directly probes electromechanical interactions in systems ranging from complex ferroelectric materials and piezoelectric compounds to biological tissues. These examples also illustrate that creative variants of PFM or a quantitative approach to data analysis contribute to a fundamental understanding of complex phenomena in solids.\nImaging of Ferroelectric Domains: Statics and DynamicsPFM utilizes a basic experimental setup of atomic force microscopy in which a conducting tip at the end of a cantilever is brought in contact with a piezoelectric sample. When a voltage is applied to the tip, the resulting deformation of the sample is monitored through the mechanical displacement of the cantilever-piezoresponse. methods that require comprehensive fielddependent measurements to extract the wall dynamics unambiguously.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe color encoded vector piezoresponse map (vector PFM), shown in Figure 8f, clearly delineates the helical structure, visualizing the electromechanically active protein fibril conformation in real space.\nPFM Manipulation and LithographyPatterning ferroelectric domains to engineer devices is a relatively recent phenomenon. In the early 1990s, the literature on pattering nonlinear optical materials with a variety of macroscopic approaches evolved. The goal was to use periodic variations in the dielectric constant to realize quasi-phase matching for applications involving optical wave guiding, secondharmonic generation, and surface acoustic wave devices. For these applications, typical feature sizes are on the order of several micrometers. Simultaneously, advances in thin-film deposition techniques and the invention of PFM converged to suggest a potential for nanometer-sized domain manipulation with high spatial resolution. 44 The two primary avenues that exploit PFM in the manipulation of ferroelectric polarization are nanostructure fabrication and highdensity information storage, as summarized in the following text.\nHigh-Density Data StorageThe PFM capability of effective control of ferroelectric domains stimulated efforts on the generation of domain structures for applications in high-density data storage and nanofabrication.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We found that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, is a ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 23 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], high Curie temperature of 426 kelvin (above that of BTO), large dielectric constant, and low dielectric loss. DIPAB exhibits good piezoelectric response and well-defined ferroelectric domains. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to perovskite ferroelectrics and ferroelectric polymers in sensing, actuation, data storage, electro-optics, and molecular or flexible electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFerroelectricity was originally discovered in Rochelle salt (8) in 1921 and later in a few other molecular systems (9), but the rapid development of ferroelectrics took place only after the discovery of ferroelectricity in perovskite barium titanate (BTO) (10) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) (11). Relative to BTO and PZT, most  molecular ferroelectrics suffer from low spontaneous polarization (P s ), low melting temperature and phase transition temperature (Curie temperature, T c ), small dielectric constant, and weak piezoelectricity; their advantages include light weight, mechanical flexibility, and environmentally friendly processing as they are lead-free. Ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers (12) share some of the drawbacks of molecular ferroelectrics, which limits their applications. The recently reported croconic acid (6) has a high spontaneous polarization of around 23 mC cm -2 ; however, evidence for a ferroelectric phase transition, piezoelectric response, or ferroelectric domains has not been reported.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe piezoresponse is measured to be as high as 360 pm under only 1 V ac, comparable with most other ferroelectrics, thus confirming its excellent piezoelectricity. Lateral PFM overlaid on 3D topography shows phase (Fig. 4C) and amplitude (Fig. 4D) mappings in good correspondence with the vertical mappings, despite the out-of-plane polarization direction of the sample. This can be understood from the piezoelectric tensor d of a C 2 point group, with nonzero d 22 and d 25 and spontaneous polarization P 2 (29), which induces normal and shear piezoelectric strains simultaneously under an electric field applied along the polar axis, whereas for BTO and PZT with out-ofplane polarization, only normal response is expected from symmetry. In this sense, the terms vertical and lateral PFM are somewhat misleading, and it is more appropriate to describe the data in terms of normal and shear PFM. Switching PFM was also carried out, with dc voltage applied on top of the ac voltage to switch the polarization, resulting in characteristic hysteresis and butterfly loops (Fig. 4, E andF).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe found that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, is a ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 23 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], high Curie temperature of 426 kelvin (above that of BTO), large dielectric constant, and low dielectric loss.

RNA provides a compatible material for in vivo nucleic acid based construction (10). It can be produced via the transcription machinery, and forms stable interactions. RNA has been used to build higher-order assemblies in vitro (11,12) and can potentially be used in vivo to engineer the intracellular environment.Here, we engineered synthetic RNA modules that assemble into functional discrete, one-, and two-dimensional scaffolds in vivo, and used them to control the spatial organization of bound proteins (Fig. 1A).

The extraordinary mechanical properties exhibited by these materials are enabled by an integration of toughening mechanisms that maintain high elasticity and dissipate mechanical energy within the protein networks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[29] By simply controlling the concentrations of the proteins (CCP, MCP1, and MCP2) and the crosslinkers (THPC and Zn 2+ ), it is possible to synthesize extremely strong, tough, stretchable, and self-adhesive hydrogels (Figure 3A,B). As a control, we found that a crosslinked network containing only CCP (no MCP1/2 nor ZnSO 4 ) results in a hydrogel that can sustain uniaxial strain no more than 39% at room temperature (Figure 3C and see Figure S9, Supporting Information, for details of the mechanical tests). Hydrogels containing a lower concentration of crosslinked CCP and either MCP1 or MCP2, in the absence of ZnSO 4 , demonstrated improved stretchability over the above control (average uniaxial strain of 94% and 72%, respectively) at the cost of reducing the ultimate strength by approximately an order of magnitude.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe enhancement of mechanical properties is more pronounced in CCP/MCP1 and CCP/MCP2 than in CCP-alone, potentially due to the combined effects of metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions within CCP/MCP1 and CCP/MCP2 networks (Figure 3C). [30] For example, a hydrogel with 20 wt% CCP and 5 wt% MCP1 crosslinked by 10.8 \u00d7 10 -3 m THPC and 1.5 m Zn 2+ can achieve an average tensile strength of 2.6 MPa at an average uniaxial strain of 549%. As demonstrated in Figure 3B, a segment of our hydrogel with a 40 mm 2 cross-sectional area can easily hold a weight of 0.5 kg.The design of tough materials generally relies on implementing mechanisms to dissipate mechanical energy and maintain high elasticity. [13,31] In this study, the CCP network enables high elasticity, while the dissipation of mechanical energy results from the reversible crosslinks from metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions (Figure 1C)-a mechanism that is distinct from the unfolding of structured domains utilized in many previous studies of protein hydrogels.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nB) Force-extension profiles of individual molecules show similar elasticity. Each molecule follows the worm-like chain model for an unfolded polypeptide with a persistence of 0.365 nm, which is indicative of an unstructured polypeptide.

Tough hydrogels are formed, depending on the concentration of ZnSO 4 present in the system. D) When the interpenetrating network hydrogel is stretched and relaxed, the phase transitioned ELP can be disrupted and reformed, respectively. Reversible decrosslinking/ crosslinking also occurs within the MCP network while the CCP network maintains elasticity throughout.opaque at room temperature (Figure 2B and Figure S13, Supporting Information) due to the effect of the kosmotropic salt lowering the cloud point of the aqueous ELP to a temperature below ambient.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A modular and tunable approach towards design of built-to-order nanoparticle systems, spray coating on PRINT\u00ae particles is demonstrated to achieve technologies capable of targeted interactions with cancer cells for applications in drug delivery. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA range of polyelectrolyte multilayers were explored, including poly-L-lysine (PLL)/hyaluronic acid (HA) [PLL/HA 500K ], PLL/dextran sulfate (DXS) [PLL/DXS], PLL/poly(acrylic acid) [PLL/PAA], chitosan/HA [Chit/HA 500K ], and chitosan/PAA [Chit/PAA] (see Supplemental Figure 4), further illustrating a primary advantage of LbL as a means of tailoring the surface properties of these NP systems. These films, while diverse in the range of materials incorporated, behaved similarly in coating the NP systems without compromising the particle shape or significantly increasing the size beyond a few tens of nanometers.Recovered and purified particles visualized by electron microscopy, including SEM and TEM, are displayed in Figures 3 and4. Figures 3A and3B are representative of the uncoated, crosslinked PRINT\u00ae PLGA 200\u00d7200nm particle array, along with the corresponding recovered particles observed by both SEM (Figure 3C) and TEM (Figure 4B).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis effectively demonstrates the capability of Spray-LbL as a means of tuning film thickness by incorporating higher molecular weight polymers with more bilayer coatings. Additional parameters to tune film thickness are longer spray times and higher concentrations of material sprayed.As an additional test of particle functionalization, the polycationic layer, poly-L-lysine (PLL), was labeled with a Cy5.5 dye (Lumiprobe, Cy5.5-NHS ester). Deposition was tracked using fluorescence imaging and shown to significantly increase following layers 1 and 3, consistent with the subsequent addition of PLL Cy5.5 . This is also demonstrated by directly comparing PLL/DXS films cast both with and without PLLCy5.5 using confocal microscopy (Supplemental Figure 6).While particle functionalization is clearly demonstrated and in a reproducible manner, questions regarding biological functionality remained as this component of the carrier system is critical to the translational relevance of the technology. Using the labeled PLL Cy5.5 Spray-LbL functionalized NP systems, particles were incubated with a triple negative breast cancer cell line, BT-20.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis step therefore allowed for the deposition of water-based polyelectrolytes using Spray-LbL.As shown in Scheme 1, Spray-LbL on PRINT\u00ae nanoparticles, following vapor-phase crosslinking of the PVA support films, is achieved by spraying an aqueous solution of cationic polyelectrolyte is sprayed onto the NP containing films for 3 seconds and, after briefly rinsing with water (3 seconds), an anionic polyelectrolyte is subsequently sprayed onto the films (3 seconds). This cycle can then be repeated indefinitely to control the thickness of the polyelectrolyte coating. In the final step, the particles are harvested by sonicating the films in water, which causes the particles to detach from the PVA substrate.Using AFM, the shape, persistence and uniformity of the particles were monitored with each processing step, beginning with the initial NP array, followed by crosslinking, and subsequent Spray-LbL deposition, as shown in Figure 2 (corresponding amplitude images shown in Supplemental Figure 3).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Phonons in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were recently found to exhibit unique thickness dependence due to the interplay between short and long range interactions. Here we report Raman spectra of atomically thin sheets of WS2 and WSe2, isoelectronic compounds of MoS2, in the mono- to few-layer thickness regime. We show that, similar to the case of MoS2, the characteristic A1g and E2g(1) modes exhibit stiffening and softening with increasing number of layers, respectively, with a small shift of less than 3 cm(-1) due to large mass of the atoms. Thickness dependence is also observed in a series of multiphonon bands arising from overtone, combination, and zone edge phonons, whose intensity exhibit significant enhancement in excitonic resonance conditions. Some of these multiphonon peaks are found to be absent only in monolayers. These features provide a unique fingerprint and rapid identification for monolayer flakes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt should be noted that resonance Raman features are also seen with 473 nm excitation but to a lesser degree (See Supporting Information for details).Figure 5b highlights that a peak at ~ 310 cm -1 , which is consistently observed for multilayer flakes of WS 2 , is absent in monolayers. The origin of this mode is not clear, however, its absence in monolayers suggests that it may be related to rigid layer shear.Relatively large frequency of this peak suggests that it is a combination of low-frequency modes 26,45 with another phonon mode. Figure 6b shows that similar behavior is observed in a peak located around 308 cm -1 for WSe 2 . This peak is absent in monolayers and shows clear softening with increasing thickness. Thus, it is possibly a combination mode of a shear and \nMethodsBulk crystals of 2H-WS 2 and 2H-WSe 2 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT).

Here we analysed variation at eight microsatellite loci to assess the genetic structure and to infer patterns of larval dispersal for a brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, at an isolated system of reefs in northern Western Australia. Spatial autocorrelation analyses show that populations are locally subdivided, and that the majority of larvae recruit to within 100 m of their natal colony. Further, a combination of F- and R- statistics showed significant differentiation at larger spatial scales (2-60 km) between sites, and this pattern was clearly not associated with distance. However, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled. Individual assignments of these migrants to the most likely populations suggest that the majority of migrants were produced at the only site that was not decimated by a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching event. Furthermore, the only site that recovered to prebleaching levels received most of these immigrants. We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nConsequently, the conclusion that the majority of brooded larvae produced by S. hystrix settle very close to their natal colony is now well supported in two very different ecological systems, irrespective of local environmental conditions and history.Disturbance, broader scale dispersal, and source/sink dynamics Despite this preponderance of local recruitment over scales of tens of metres, we have also presented evidence that S. hystrix larvae periodically disperse over much greater distances. The pairwise F-and R-statistics indicated that some sites separated by relatively large distances were more closely related than those that were nearer to each other. For example, the pairwise R ST comparison between SL4 and SS3 was not significant. Thus, sufficient gene flow over the 40 km of open water between Seringapatam and Scott Reef has prevented genetic differentiation, assuming that the mutation process conforms to the stepwise mutation model. This pattern contrasts dramatically with the strong and significant differentiation of SS1 and SL1, which occur on the same reef and are separated by only three kilometres. In contrast to microsatellite variation of S. hystrix in the Red Sea (Maier et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2005a;Underwood et al . 2006). Here, we present biological data utilizing the microsatellites developed by Underwood et al . (2006) to investigate the pattern of genetic connectivity among populations of the brooding pocilloporid Seriatopora hystrix within the Scott Reef system in northern Western Australia.The life history characteristics and genetic structure of S. hystrix suggest that the majority of dispersal is local. Larvae are produced sexually through internal fertilization of the eggs, are brooded within the polyp, and then released into the water column at an advanced developmental stage. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that larvae are competent to settle within hours and that most will settle within one or two days of release, provided suitable substrata are available (Harrison & Wallace 1990). In addition, it is unlikely that sperm survive for more than 10 h (Wallace & Willis 1994).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nConsequently, the potential for long distance dispersal over tens of kilometres or more of sperm or larvae via ocean currents seems limited.Data from allozymes of S. hystrix on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) support this conclusion (Ayre & Dufty 1994;Ayre & Hughes 2000). Levels of genetic differentiation are extraordinarily high ( F ST = 0.43 in both studies), and inbreeding and localized recruitment appear to be central features of these populations. The authors concluded that individual reefs depend primarily upon self-seeding for maintenance of populations, and that longer distance dispersal is rare over ecological time. Further, data from three microsatellite loci on S. hystrix from the Red Sea also indicated high levels of localized subdivision and spatially restricted dispersal over scales less than 20 km (Maier et al . 2005). However, because distances between individual S. hystrix colonies within sampling sites were not recorded in these studies, the finest scale of genetic subdivision and recruitment (i.e.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Partially reduced nickel interfaced with nickel oxide results from thermal decomposition of nickel hydroxide precursors bonded to carbon nanotube sidewalls. The metal ion-carbon nanotube interactions impede complete reduction and Ostwald ripening of nickel species into the less hydrogen evolution reaction active pure nickel phase.

These networks of observations are always undergoing change. Changes of particular importance include: (i) an increasing amount of ocean data from buoys, which are slightly differ-ent than data from ships; (ii) an increasing amount of ship data from engine intake thermometers, which are slightly different than data from bucket sea-water temperatures; and (iii) a large increase in land-station data that enables better analysis of key regions that may be warming faster or slower than the global average.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nStrengthening of ocean heat uptake efficiency associated with the recent climate hiatus\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMWatanabe\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYKamae\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMYoshimori\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAOka\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSato\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMIshii\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTMochizuki\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMKimoto\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/grl.50541\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGeophys.

The resulting integration improves spatial coverage over many areas, including the Arctic, where temperatures have increased rapidly in recent decades (1). We applied the same methods used in our old analysis for quality control, time-dependent bias corrections, and other data processing steps (21) to the ISTI databank to address artificial shifts in the data caused by changes in station location, temperature instrumentation, observing practice, urbanization, siting conditions, etc. These corrections are essentially the same as those used in the GHCN-Monthly version 3 dataset (22, 23), which is updated operationally by NOAA's NCEI.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe number of descriptors has an immediate impact on the feasibility of any ML potential, as it does not only restrict the efficiency of the energy evaluation but also determines the dimensionality of the coordinate space to be mapped by the training sets. On the other hand, the number of descriptors must be sufficiently large to enable an unambiguous distinction of different structures. In Secs. II B 1-II B 4 several descriptors which have been developed for ML potentials are discussed. This list is by far not complete, and there are plenty of new interesting approaches, which have been proposed recently, like moment tensors, 30 scattering transforms, 31 and many others.\nB. Descriptors for machine learning potentials\nAtom centered symmetry functionsA ML approach applicable to high-dimensional systems containing large numbers of atoms has been proposed by Behler and Parrinello in 2007 employing NNs. 32 As in many conventional empirical potentials, the potential energy E is constructed as a sum of local atomic energies E i of all atoms i in the system,E = N atoms \ued70 i=1 E i .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n45,46 Starting with NNs 32 in 2007, several different ML approaches suitable for high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms have now become available 38,40 and are still evolving rapidly. 10,47,48 An overview about the increasing use of different ML techniques to the construction of PESs is shown in Fig. 1.In this section, several ML methods along with their use in the construction of PESs are outlined, which in principle could be combined almost arbitrarily with the descriptors discussed above. Still, currently there are a few dominant combinations of descriptors and ML methods, but this is not because of the compatibility or incompatibility of the different approaches, but it is mainly a consequence of the personal preferences of the developers. \nB. Neural networksArtificial neural networks are the oldest ML method 49 and they have first been developed to understand the signal processing in the brain. They also represent the first ML method which has been used to fit a DFT PES by Doren and coworkers in 1995, 26 and to date a large number of NN potentials have been developed for many molecular and condensed systems.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n7 also be used to accurately identify amorphous and crystalline structures in MD simulations. They found that this approach is superior to conventional methods for structure identification like Steinhardt parameters, 53 which supports the suitability of ACSFs for the distinction of different structural motifs. This application, which is very useful on its own, can be viewed as an intermediate step of the construction of the NN PES, since the proper characterization of the atomic environments is a mandatory ingredient for obtaining a reliable structure-energy relation in NNPs.Finally, it should be noted that NNs are currently experiencing an enormous boost in development under the name \"deep learning,\" which is essentially based on very large NNs.\nC. Gaussian approximation potentials and kernel methodsGaussian approximation potentials (GAPs) 38,54 are an important example for kernel-based ML potentials, which are obtained by combining a suitable structural descriptor and a kernel establishing the connection between structure and energy. In case of GAPs, the atomic energies E i in Eq.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The key concept involves self-generation of auxiliary evanescent fields which facilitate the required local power conservation, without interfering with the device performance in the far field. We demonstrate our scheme by presenting exact reactive solutions to the challenging problems of reflectionless beam splitting and perfect reflection, verified via full wave simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIndeed, the formulation in [18] showed that sufficient conditions to ensure passive and lossless design in this case include local power conservation and local wave-impedance equalization, requiring at least one additional diffraction mode, e.g. specular reflection. Although this reflection is minor for small-tomoderate angle refraction, it becomes significant when wide-angle refraction is considered.These observations raised serious questions regarding previously-reported achievements.Primarily, could passive lossless metasurfaces achieve truly-reflectionless engineered refraction? In a recent paper, Wong et al. [20] provided a positive answer to that question. Relying on generalized scattering matrix theory, the authors showed that an asymmetric stacking of three reactance sheets could be designed to simultaneously match the wave impedance of both the incident and refracted plane waves, leading to zero reflections even in the case of wide-angle refraction. This approach was generalized in [21], showing that this structure corresponds to an omega-type bianisotropic metasurface (O-BMS). In O-BMSs, meta-atoms exhibit electric and magnetic polarizabilities as in HMSs, but also feature magnetoelectric coupling [2,22].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nControlling vector Bessel beams with metasurfaces\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCPfeiffer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAGrbic\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPhys.

Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles, birds (sampled with point-counts PC and mist net-MN), saplings, and trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and recurrent-burned forest were higher than between control and once-burned forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation communities in recurrent-burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms acting behind them. Policy-makers need to explicitly address protection of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2008, McMichael et al. 2012). However, in recent decades, especially in Brazil and Indonesia, fire-return intervals have become decadal or even shorter in some forests (Cochrane 2003, Langner & Siegert 2009). This increase in fire prevalence is primarily caused by an increase in ignition sources from agricultural activities that use fire as a tool for land management (Laurance 2004, Cardoso et al. 2008, Morton et al. 2013) and an increase in forest flammability from other human activities, such as logging and fragmentation (Cochrane 2001, Siegert et al. 2001). In addition, fires are often associated with severe droughts (Chen et al. 2011). For example, around 2.6 million hectares and 3.9 million hectares of forest were burned during El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in Indonesia and Brazilian Amazon (Siegert et al. 2001, Alencar et al. 2006, respectively).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2001, Alencar et al. 2006, respectively). Most of the predictions of fires associated to climate changes and human land uses in general, state that such events may occur more often in the coming years (e.g., Cochrane & Barber 2009, Fu et al. 2013), affecting not only Amazon forest, but also the hyper-fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, the interactions between human economic activities, climate change, and fire pose a serious threat for tropical forests.One of the consequences of this increase in fire-return intervals is an increase in the area of forests being subjected to repeated burns, which can alter forest structure and composition when compared to single burns (Barlow & Peres 2008). For example, when tropical forests are burned for the first time (or when fire-return intervals are millennial), it is a surface fire that usually burns just a thin layer of available fuels, such as the leaf litter and small fallen branches, as well as some small trees and saplings (Cochrane et al. 1999). Although these fires are relatively small, they kill a large proportion of trees and aboveground bio-mass (Cochrane et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2002, Barlow & Peres 2008, Silveira et al. 2013, respectively), reduce sapling, seedling and tree densities (Clearly et al. 2006), and cause substantial reptile mortality (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998). Existing studies on the impacts of recurrent fires are primarily focused on plants (e.g., Cochrane & Schulze 1999, Barlow et al. 2003a,b, Haugaasen et al. 2003a, Slik & Eichhorn 2003, Toma et al. 2005, Barlow & Peres 2008, Slik et al. 2008) and secondly on birds (e.g., Barlow & Peres 2004, Adeney et al. 2006, Mestre et al. 2013).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Nevertheless, dendrite growth, side reactions and infinite relative volume change have prevented it from practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a promising metallic lithium anode design by infusing molten lithium into a polymeric matrix. The electrospun polyimide employed is stable against highly reactive molten lithium and, via a conformal layer of zinc oxide coating to render the surface lithiophilic, molten lithium can be drawn into the matrix, affording a nano-porous lithium electrode. Importantly, the polymeric backbone enables uniform lithium stripping/plating, which successfully confines lithium within the matrix, realizing minimum volume change and effective dendrite suppression. The porous electrode reduces the effective current density; thus, flat voltage profiles and stable cycling of more than 100 cycles is achieved even at a high current density of 5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 in both carbonate and ether electrolyte. The advantages of the porous, polymeric matrix provide important insights into the design principles of lithium metal anodes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOn one hand, the use of solid electrolytes to suppress dendrite propagation remains premature in the current stage [15][16][17] , for they often fall short of meeting the high-power requirement at ambient temperature due to limited ionic conductivity 18,19 , together with issues such as large interfacial impedance 20,21 . On the other hand, the most common approaches to dendrite mitigation in liquid electrolyte focus on the stabilization of SEI via adjusting the electrolyte composition and additives [22][23][24][25][26] . Though proven to be effective, most additives will be continuously consumed during battery cycling so that the suppression effect is not fully sustainable [27][28][29] . Alternatively, the application of a mechanically stable artificial SEI coating such as polymer or solid-state blocking layers has been proposed [30][31][32][33] . For example, a promising nanoscale interfacial engineering approach has been demonstrated recently based on interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres, ultrathin two-dimensional boron nitride or oxidized polyacrylonitrile fibres to control the dendrite growth and improve the cycling CE [34][35][36] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe synergetic effect of lithium polysulfide and lithium nitrate to prevent lithium dendrite growth\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWLi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

However, dendrite growth and limited Coulombic efficiency during cycling have prevented its practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we report that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt enables the high-rate cycling of a lithium metal anode at high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.1%) without dendrite growth. With 4\u2009M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the electrolyte, a lithium|lithium cell can be cycled at 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 6,000 cycles, and a copper|lithium cell can be cycled at 4\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4%. These excellent performances can be attributed to the increased solvent coordination and increased availability of lithium ion concentration in the electrolyte. Further development of this electrolyte may enable practical applications for lithium metal anode in rechargeable batteries. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nZheng et al. 8 used interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres to stabilize Li surface with a CE of B99% for 4150 cycles. However, no electrolytes have been reported to date that simultaneously overcome all of the challenges-dendritic metal deposition, low CE during Li deposition/stripping processes and poor rate performance-of Li metal electrodes. Most of the approaches reported to date mainly worked at relatively low current densities (o1 mA cm \u00c0 2 ), which are insufficient to meet the requirements for many practical applications (43 mA cm \u00c0 2 ) 2,8,10,11 . Therefore, new electrolytes that can lead to the high rate and stable cycling of the Li metal anode are urgently needed for the further development of rechargeable Li metal batteries.Here we demonstrate that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the salt lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI or LiN(SO 2 F) 2 ) 30 results in the dendrite-free plating of Li metal at high rates and with high CE.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFailure mechanism for fast-charged lithium metal batteries with liquid electrolytes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDLv\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/aenm.201400993\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAdv.

Multi-geochemical proxies, including different iron speciation and relevant ratios (FeHR/FeT, FeP/FeHR and FeT/Al ratios) and molybdenum concentrations, were used to reconstruct the paleo-depositional environment of this black shale horizon. The ratios of different iron species (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR < 0.80) suggest an overall anoxic conditions (ferruginous) over the deposition of the black shales, although intermittent euxinic (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR \u2248 0.80) and oxic (FeHR/FeT < 0.38) intervals could have occurred. Furthermore, FeT/Al ratios (FeT/Al \u2264 0.51) confirm that water column may not be persistent euxinia during the deposition of the Datangpo black shales. Meanwhile, molybdenum concentrations show a decreasing trend towards the top of the black shales, reconciling the gradual oxygenating trend during this period as stated above. Compared to \u03b434SPy values in the Mesoproterozoic deep ocean, more positive \u03b434SPy values of this study may result from a small size of sulfate reservoir. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIntroductionThe Neoproterozoic Era (1000-542 Ma) was an important interval subjected to dramatic climatic changes and biological evolutions in Earth's history. The Snowball Earth hypothesis suggested that the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets during the Neoproterozoic glaciation epoches (Hoffman et al., 1998). In the aftermath of glaciations, several lines of evidence, including iron chemistry and sulfur isotopic data from China, Canada, Oman and Australia, indicate stepwise oxygenation of the postglacial Ediacaran ocean (635-542 Ma), stimulating the evolution of early animal life (Canfield et al., 2007;Fike et al., 2006;Komiya et al., 2008;Maruyama and Santosh, 2008;McFadden et al., 2008).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n820 Ma and 542 Ma (Li et al., 2003;Wang and Li, 2003;Wang et al., 2009). A southeast-facing (present orientation) passive continental margin on the Yangtze Block was subsequently developed in the course of breakup of the Rodinia Supercontinent (Fig. 1A). Thermal subsidence related to the post-rift extension of South China Block created significant accommodation space in which thick Middle-to-Late Neoproterozoic successions were deposited (Jiang et al., 2003;Wang and Li, 2003).Neoproterozoic stratigraphic successions in South China comprise well exposed, relatively unaltered glacial and interglacial deposits (Fig. 1B). The Cryogenian Group unconformably overlies the slate rocks of the Banxi Group. Two main Cryogenian diamictite successions, the lower Jiangkou Group and the upper Nantuo Formation, have been recognized in South China.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA Neoproterozoic snowball earth\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPFHoffman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJKaufman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGPHalverson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDPSchrag\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tScience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t281\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1998\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNeoproterozoic stratigraphic comparison of the Lesser Himalaya (India) and Yangtze block (south China): Paleogeographic implications\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGQJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLESohl\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNChristie-Blick\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGeology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t31\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2003\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLow marine sulphate and protracted oxygenation of the Proterozoic biosphere\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLCKah\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWLyons\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTDFrank\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t431\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2004\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMicrobiological fractionation of sulfur isotopes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIRKaplan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSCRittenberg\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

In stage 4 (1965\u20131981), the extent of Neoproterozoic glaciation was rethought in light of plate tectonics. Distinctive chemical sediments (iron\u00b1manganese formations and cap carbonates) were identified. In basic climate models, modest lowering of solar luminosity resulted in global glaciation due to ice-albedo feedback, and deglaciation due to greenhouse forcing resulted from silicate-weathering feedback in the carbon cycle. Neoproterozoic glacial geologists were blind to these ideas. In stage 5 (1982\u20131997), reliable palaeomagnetic data combined with glacial marine sedimentation models confirmed that Neoproterozoic ice sheets reached sea level close to the palaeoequator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1144/M36.2\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nNeoproterozoic glacial records have been discovered on 23 palaeocontinents, their rate of discovery changing little since 1871.

The history of research before 1998 is described in five stages defined by publication spikes; subsequent work is not covered because historical perspective is lacking. In stage 1 (1871-1907), 'Cambrian' (now Neoproterozoic) glaciation was recognized successively in Scotland, Australia, India, Norway, Svalbard and China. Criteria for recognition included faceted and striated pebbles in matrix-supported conglomerates resting on ice-worn bedrock pavements.

It was evident that glaciation 'at or just before the beginning of the Cambrian' had been more extreme than in the Pleistocene, possibly equal to the composite Late Palaeozoic glaciations of Gondwanaland. These findings were highlighted in a Symposium on Palaeozoic and Pre-Cambrian Climates at the 17th IGC (1937) in Moscow.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTen substantial papers describe Neoproterozoic glacial deposits in different parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and North America. Highlights include first-hand accounts of various pre-Dwyka glacial deposits throughout southern Africa (Gevers & Beetz 1940), the vast extent of the Nantuo Tillite in South China (Lee & Lee 1940) and the existence of glacial deposits in central Africa close to the equator (Davies 1940;Robert 1940). A consensus emerged that 'eo-Cambrian' glaciation was matched only in the late Palaeozoic, and that invertebrate animals arose following retreat of the ice sheets.However, the rejection of continental drift in the late 1920s following intense debate (Newman 1995;Oreskes 1999) had a chilling effect on pre-Pleistocene palaeoclimate research. If late Palaeozoic glaciation was allowed to remain 'a hopeless riddle', as Wegener put it, what chance was there to understand glacial periods twice their age?\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As suggested previously, a turbulent flow is driven by geothermal heating at the seafloor, which is balanced by a similar heat loss through the ice sheet above. It is argued that the expected horizontal inhomogeneities in these heat fluxes are sufficient to generate baroclinic instability, which drives geostrophic turbulence. Turbulent eddies then transport heat upward and poleward along isolines of constant density, thereby maintaining a statically stable stratification, contrary to previous findings from numerical models that do not adequately resolve the geostrophic turbulence. The kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is expected to be controlled by a balance between the potential energy input by the diabatic forcing and frictional dissipation in the bottom boundary layer. The resulting characteristic flow speed is estimated to be on the order of 1 cm s\u22121, which is in agreement with previous numerical simulations. Eddy diffusivities are estimated to be on the order of 100 m2 s\u22121, which is smaller than in the present-day ocean but probably within one order of magnitude. Because of the weak forcing, the resulting gradients of temperature and salinity would be much smaller than in the present-day ocean, with global-scale potential temperature variations on the order of 0.1 K, again in agreement with previous numerical simulations. The presented theoretical arguments may also be relevant to other planetary bodies with an ice-covered ocean. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBecause of the weak forcing, the resulting gradients of temperature and salinity would be much smaller than in the present-day ocean, with global-scale potential temperature variations on the order of 0.1 K, again in agreement with previous numerical simulations.

These periods are commonly referred to as ''snowball Earth'' events. While many studies have simulated the atmospheric and climate dynamics of snowball Earth events (e.g., Wetherald and Manabe 1975;Pierrehumbert 2005;Abbot and Pierrehumbert 2010;Voigt and Marotzke 2010;Voigt et al. 2012;Abbot et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs in Ashkenazy et al. (2013Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) ) and Ashkenazy and Tziperman (2016), the focus here will be on the so-called hard snowball scenario, where the entire ocean is covered by an ice sheet. Possible implications of the results for a ''Waterbelt'' (Hyde et al. 2000) or ''Jormungand'' (Abbot et al. 2011) state with incomplete ice cover will be discussed in the conclusions.\nTheoretical considerationsIn this section, we will consider what the appropriate boundary conditions for a snowball Earth ocean are and infer constraints for the expected circulation. The inferences will be tested in idealized process-oriented simulations in section 3.\na. Boundary conditions and ocean heat transportAssuming that the ocean was entirely covered by sea ice, the heat budget of the global ocean would most likely be dominated by a balance between geothermal heating at the seafloor and heat loss through the ice sheet (see sketch in Fig. 1).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nConvection with rotation in a neutral ocean: A study of open-ocean deep convection\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHJones\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMarshall\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1175/1520-0485(1993)023<1009:CWRIAN>2.0.CO;2\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

Graphene has been recently explored as a two-dimensional nanoscale material, and has demonstrated simple device functions based on conventional top-down fabrication. However, the synthetic approach to encoding electronic functionality and thus enabling an entire integrated graphene electronics in a chemical synthesis had not previously been demonstrated. Here we report an unconventional approach for the synthesis of monolithically-integrated electronic devices based on graphene and graphite. Spatial patterning of heterogeneous catalyst metals permits the selective growth of graphene and graphite, with controlled number of graphene layers. Graphene transistor arrays with graphitic electrodes and interconnects were formed from synthesis. These functional, all-carbon structures were transferrable onto a variety of substrates. The integrated transistor arrays were used to demonstrate real-time, multiplexed chemical sensing, and more significantly, multiple carbon layers of the graphene-graphite device components were vertically assembled to form a three-dimensional flexible structure which served as a top-gate transistor array. These results represent a substantial progress towards encoding electronic functionality via chemical synthesis and suggest future promise for one-step integration of graphene-graphite based electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nGraphene transistor arrays with graphitic electrodes and interconnects were formed from synthesis.

These results represent a substantial progress towards encoding electronic functionality via chemical synthesis and suggest future promise for one-step integration of graphene-graphite based electronics.We demonstrate that differences in carbon solubility of metal catalyst films can be used to synthesize different thicknesses of graphene and graphite, and such catalyst films can be patterned to enable graphene and graphite patterns in localized and selected areas. For example, a Ni or Co film has relatively high solubility of carbon (> ~1.3 at.% at 1000 \u00b0C) and can produce graphite by segregation and precipitation of the carbon on the metal surface 18,19 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn addition to contact properties of graphite electrode to graphene channel, advantages of the graphite, compared to metals, lie in its superb mechanical flexibility. We observed that even when graphite electrodes were distorted up to strain of ~2 %, I-V characteristics remained the same (Fig. 2f).The synthetic method facilitated the creation of a large-scale field-effect sensor arrays composed of monolithic graphene-graphite, which were transferred onto 285-nm SiO 2 / Si wafer. One block of the array contained nine of 2-4 layer graphene field-effect sensors with graphite single common source and independent drains. The sensor chip had four of these blocks composed of 36 sensor devices total, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The graphite electrode parts were covered with a 2 \u03bcm-thick SU8 passivation layer with openings around the 2-4 layer graphene channels. The current change measured while sweeping Ag/AgCl water-gate voltage at different pH solution is presented in Fig. 3b. The charge neutrality point shifted positively with increasing pH, and the pH sensitivity was ~17 mV/pH.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe believe the capability to synthesize monolithic graphene-graphite integrated electronics provides a promising strategy towards flexible, wearable electronics and implantable biosensor devices, and also suggests substantial promise towards future graphene-based electronics in both two and three dimensions.\nMethodsSpatially patterned, heterogeneous catalyst metal films were prepared by photolithography and thermal evaporation, and atmospheric CVD was carried out for the synthesis of the monolithic graphene-graphite structures. After the metal layers were removed in solution, the monolithic graphene-graphite structures were transferred onto Si substrate with 285 nmthick SiO 2 . For the fabrication of monolithic top-gate FETs, 400 nm-thick SiO 2 layer was evaporated as a gate dielectric and graphite film (6-8 graphene layers) was transferred and patterned as top-gate electrodes.

In this article, we map the allosteric network in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A using NMR spectroscopy. We show that positive allosteric cooperativity is generated by nucleotide and substrate binding during the transitions through the major conformational states: apo, intermediate, and closed. The allosteric network is disrupted by a single site mutation (Y204A), which also decouples the cooperativity of ligand binding. Because protein kinase A is the prototype for the entire kinome, these findings may serve as a paradigm for describing long-range coupling in other protein kinases. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe 50 residues comprising the C terminus wrap around the two lobes, docking into a hydrophobic pocket located in the small lobe (3,4).Despite sharing a highly conserved core, protein kinases are remarkably diverse in terms of their regulation, activation, and substrate recognition. Crystal structures suggest that kinases are highly dynamic, with allosteric networks that radiate throughout the molecule. Unfortunately, these structures are static and often only include the kinase core. Although there have been extensive studies of kinases in solution, including hydrogen/ deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (H/D-MS), fluorescence anisotropy (5-7), and small-angle x-ray scattering (8,9), these results lack atomic-level resolution and offer an incomplete picture of protein dynamics and recognition mechanisms, presenting a substantial limitation in understanding the enzymatic cycle of kinases, and leaving many questions unanswered. How do these enzymes discriminate cognate and noncognate substrates? What is the role of the nucleotide in substrate recognition?\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese residues make contact with the evolutionarily conserved ''spine'' (L106, L95, F185, and Y164) recently identified by Kornev et al. (42), to form a hydrophobic lining about the adenine ring (Fig. 4). Sensing and positioning of the nucleotide at this region could act as a trigger for signaling, which is propagated across a network of residues away from the active site. Perturbations \u03fe0.05 ppm are traceable across conserved residues within van der Waals radii from the hydrophobic lining (Fig. 4). Several contiguous pathways of intramolecular cross-talk can also be traced from the hydrophobic lining to residues, which can propagate signals to and from the glycine-rich, activation, Asp-Phe-Gly, and peptide-positioning loops at the entrance of the active site. We also detected noncontiguous propagation for a small subset of residues in distal sites, for which no clear pathway of interaction can be traced. In the wild-type enzyme, two regions display relatively large \u232c\u2426 values.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis region contains highly conserved loops, including the DFG loop, which has been proposed to be a switch between active and inactive kinase conformations (16). The resonances belonging to the DFG loop (F185, G186, and F187) were broadened beyond detection (see * , Fig. 2), indicating conformational interconversion between multiple states, which were silent to the x-ray analysis. Significant changes are observed for residues T201 and G200, which became exchange-broadened; these residues are conserved throughout the Ser/Thr kinase family (17). The large perturbations at the peptide positioning loop, with concomitant changes in the DFGand glycine-rich loops, reveal that the nucleotide affects both the small and large lobes, perhaps priming the enzyme for substrate binding. This is supported by x-ray studies carried out by Johnson et al. (18) that show ligand-induced conformational changes at these domains. The F helix located near the peptide-positioning loop also has large \u232c\u2426 values that gradually decrease toward the C terminus where a third region is sensitive to binding.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As a consequence, we are willing to use huge amounts of energy to produce it. Solid-state lighting (SSL) is an emerging technology that promises performance features and efficiencies well beyond those of traditional artificial lighting, accompanied by potentially massive shifts in (a) the consumption of light, (b) the human productivity and energy use associated with that consumption and (c) the semiconductor chip area inventory and turnover required to support that consumption. In this paper, we provide estimates of the baseline magnitudes of these shifts using simple extrapolations of past behaviour into the future. For past behaviour, we use recent studies of historical and contemporary consumption patterns analysed within a simple energy-economics framework (a Cobb\u2013Douglas production function and profit maximization). For extrapolations into the future, we use recent reviews of believed-achievable long-term performance targets for SSL. We also discuss ways in which the actual magnitudes could differ from the baseline magnitudes of these shifts. These include: changes in human societal demand for light; possible demand for features beyond lumens; and guidelines and regulations aimed at economizing on consumption of light and associated energy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch unenclosed outdoor areas (e.g. streets, parks and other recreation and public spaces) could all be rendered more useful if better illuminated in the evening hours (albeit at the cost of reducing the contrast of the night sky due to light pollution (Boyce 2003)). And there is a natural human tendency to gaze out (we value windows, not just because they are a portal for incoming light, but because of the view they afford (Boyce 2003)) into faraway spaces, even if we do not directly occupy those spaces.We conclude that it is possible that the average unshared illuminated area is nearing a saturation point, but plausible arguments can be made that the saturation point may yet be a factor 10\u00d7 or greater away.\nDemand for features beyond lumensAlthough the primary demand for light is to illuminate our environment, there are many other features of light that are important to the consumer. Arguably, these features were just as important as decreased cost in the historical increases in consumption of light as one lighting technology gave way to the next. They therefore counter the possible saturations in consumption of light that were discussed in section 5.1.For example, the transitions within chemical-fuel-based lighting (e.g.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, an increase in the cost of energy associated with lighting, which would normally reduce both human productivity and energy consumption, can be mitigated by an increase in the efficiency of lighting: energy consumption can be held constant while maintaining some human productivity increase or energy consumption can be reduced without a decrease in human productivity.Whether history can be used in this case to predict the future cannot be known, of course, and there are at least two ways in which this growth might be moderated. First, as discussed in section 5.1, demand for light may be nearing saturation, both in terms of illuminances (lm m -2 ) as well as in terms of the per-capita illuminated areas surrounding people. Second, as discussed in section 5.3, even if intrinsic demand for light is not nearing saturation, non-legislated guidelines and legislated regulations aimed at efficient lighting system designs and light usage may nonetheless bring about a saturation.However, reasonable arguments can also be made that as a human society we are not near a saturation in consumption of light.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSaturation in demand for raw lumensAs has been discussed, at current levels of per-capita consumption of light, there is no evidence that we have reached a saturation in the demand for light. It is nevertheless an open question whether we will approach such a saturation in the future or whether per-capita consumption of light will continue to scale linearly with gdp/CoL. To understand this question more quantitatively, we decompose per-capita consumption of light into the product of three factors: I N , the average illuminancefoot_11 (or light per unit area, in units of lm m -2 ) that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours; \u03c4 on /(\u03c4 on + \u03c4 off ), a dimensionless illumination duty factor that accounts for how many hours per year the area around a person is actually illuminated and a N /(1 + a N \u03c1 N ), the average unshared illuminated area (in units of m 2 ) that a person is surrounded by 24 . In other words,\u03d5 = I N \u2022 \u03c4 on \u03c4 on + \u03c4 off \u2022 a N 1 + a N \u03c1 N .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It has 22 spectral bands including the day/night band (DNB), which is a panchromatic reflective solar band (RSB) covering a wavelength range of 500\u2013900 nm. Similar to other RSBs, the radiometric calibration of the DNB is in reference to the sunlight reflected from an onboard solar diffuser (SD). As an independent validation to the SD measurement, lunar calibration has been regularly scheduled at nearly constant lunar phase. In this paper, the lunar calibration strategies developed for RSB are extended to DNB. The on-orbit gain coefficient, or the so-called F factor, is derived for DNB low-gain stage (LGS) from lunar data for each lunar calibration event. Its on-orbit change is compared with the change of the LGS SD F factor. For more accurate comparison, the impact of the on-orbit relative spectral responses (RSR) change, caused by the wavelength-dependent degradation of the optical throughput of VIIRS telescope mirrors, must be considered. This impact is more significant for DNB than other RSBs because of its wider bandwidth, and the impact to the SD and lunar calibrations are different due to different scene spectra. Simulation results show a gradually increased deviation of 1% between SD and lunar trends since launch till now and 0.3% deviation since 2 April 2012 lunar calibration, when the lunar F factor was firstly calculated, till now. Taking this effect into account, the on-orbit changes of the SD F factor and lunar F factor agree with each other in less than 0.3%. Our results validate the stability of the DNB SD calibration while demonstrating how the on-orbit RSR change should be considered in the radiometric calibration and data usage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSimilar to other RSBs, the radiometric calibration of the DNB is in reference to the sunlight reflected from an onboard solar diffuser (SD).

While OLS is not radiometrically calibrated, the absolute calibration requirement specification for the DNB is 5% at half maximum radiance and 10% at maximum radiance [Geis et al., 2012].The DNB sensor data record (SDR) of Earth view (EV) scene radiance is converted from the detector response in digital number (DN) using the calibrated detector gain coefficient or F factor. The calibration of the DNB LGS uses the solar diffuser (SD) view, and the procedure is similar to the one used for the other RSBs [Lei et al., 2015a;Lei et al., 2015b]. As has been demonstrated for other RSBs as well, the Moon can be used as a source to independently perform the calibration and track the stability of the SD calibration [Xiong et al., 2015].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn this paper, the deviation is estimated and verified by the measurement.

Many examples of bio-inspired hard materials can be found in the literature; far less attention has been devoted to soft systems. Here we introduce deterministic routes to low-modulus thin film materials with stress/strain responses that can be tailored precisely to match the non-linear properties of biological tissues, with application opportunities that range from soft biomedical devices to constructs for tissue engineering. The approach combines a low-modulus matrix with an open, stretchable network as a structural reinforcement that can yield classes of composites with a wide range of desired mechanical responses, including anisotropic, spatially heterogeneous, hierarchical and self-similar designs. Demonstrative application examples in thin, skin-mounted electrophysiological sensors with mechanics precisely matched to the human epidermis and in soft, hydrogel-based vehicles for triggered drug release suggest their broad potential uses in biomedical devices. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRugged and breathable forms of stretchable electronics with adherent composite substrates for transcutaneous monitoring\n\t\t\n\t\t\tK.-IJang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

The nanowires exhibit a uniform diameter of 2\u20133 nm. The length can reach up to several microns. It was found that Cr species produced dumbbell-like nuclei which play a pivotal role in the formation of the Pt nanowires. Such Pt nanowires can be tuned to nanocubes by simply decreasing the concentration of [Cr(CO)6]. Compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst (45 wt%, Vulcan, Tanaka) and Pt black (fuel cell grade, Sigma), the synthesized Pt nanowires exhibit superior performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with a specific activity of 0.368 mA/cm2, which was 2.7 and 1.8 times greater than that of Pt/C (0.138 mA/cm2) and Pt black (0.202 mA/cm2), respectively. The mass activity of Pt nanowires (0.088 mA/\u03bcg) is 2.3 times that of Pt black (0.038 mA/\u03bcg) and comparable to that of Pt/C (0.085 mA/\u03bcg). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPd-Pt bimetallic nanodendrites with high activity for oxygen reduction\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLim\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPH CCamargo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tECCho\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJTao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXMLu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYMZhu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYNXia\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tScience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t324\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2009\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced electrocatalytic performance of processed, ultrathin, supported Pd-Pt core-shell nanowire catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCKoenigsmann\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tACSantulli\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKPGong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMBVukmirovic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWPZhou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tESutter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSSWong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRRAdzic\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

This is the very first time both large electrochemical strains and fast response rates were achieved in the conducting polymer actuators. The large and fast electrochemical deformation resulted from the fact that the PPy film doped with large TFSI anions swelled in PC such that TFSI can insert and expel the PPy film easily, and that a high ionic conductivity in H2O/PC solution enabled to move TFSI quickly. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe PPy film was cut into a 10 mm \u00d7 2 mm strip and set in a one-compartment three-electrode cell described elsewhere [8] to measure change in length of the PPy strip by using a laser displacement meter (KEYENCE LE-4000) at typically 0.1 MPa load (under isotonic conditions) on applying potential. The definition of electrochemical strain of PPy actuators was change in length of the strip divided by the original length ( l/l 0 ). When the maximum strain was measured, potential was swept between -0.9 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + by using a potentio-galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research 263A) at 2 mV s -1 in H 2 O/PC solutions of LiTFSI. Electrochemical contraction and expansion were conducted by applying a constant potential of -0.7 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + , respectively, for 100 s except the second expansion (30 s) at room temperature.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe peak response rate was much larger than that (ca. 0.1% s -1 ) of other conventional PPy actuators [2], and that (3.2% s -1 ) of a PF 6 --doped PPy by using resistance compensation techniques [14]. Ding et al. [15] prepared a tubular PF 6 --doped PPy with a Pt helical wire, exhibiting up to 13% s -1 strain rate and 5% strain, and we reported a PPy film with a compliant Au electrode at one side, prepared from an MB solution of TBACF 3 SO 3 , showed a peak strain rate of 8.8% s -1 and the maximum strain of 12.1% [16].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe large and fast electrochemical deformation resulted from the fact that the PPy film doped with large TFSI anions swelled in PC such that TFSI can insert and expel the PPy film easily, and that a high ionic conductivity in H 2 O/PC solution enabled to move TFSI quickly.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIntroductionConducting polymers (CPs) such as PPy are promising soft actuator materials potentially applicable to artificial muscle devices because of their large electrochemical stresses (3)(4)(5)  [1][2][3][4], 10 times as large as that (0.35 MPa) [5] of mammalian skeletal muscles. The applications of CP linear actuators have been, however, quite limited due to their moderate electrochemical strains (1-3%) [1,2,6]. Recently, some PPy actuators with more than 10% electrochemical strains appeared [7][8][9][10][11][12], and some of which achieved up to 40% strain [11,12], almost same level as that of skeletal muscles.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We attribute ultralow thermal conductivity to a cluster rattling mechanism, based on strong phonon\u2013phonon scattering via the coexistence of collective motions involving various atom groups. These results call attention to the vital thermal transport processes and thermal management strategies for applications with all-inorganic halide perovskites. Further, CsSnI3 shows a rare combination of ultralow thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, so it can be a promising material for unique applications as an electrically conductive thermal insulator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nVia quantitative joint experimental-theoretical analysis, we present the unambiguous demonstration of the impact of cluster rattling mechanism on thermal transport properties: comparable and even lower k lattice of AIHPs compared with HHPs (18) (k HHP = 0.5 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 ) imply that the strength of phonon-phonon scattering induced by the cluster rattling mechanism is comparable to that originating from the individual rattlers. While the size, shape, symmetry, and vibrational modes of the organic molecule are key parameters for thermal transport properties in HHP (20), the topological pattern and bond strength distribution of the entire framework dictates thermal transport properties in AIHP.To understand other transport properties of CsSnI 3 , we measured the four-probe electrical conductivity (\u03c3) and Seebeck coefficient (S) of the exact same NW for thermal transport in Fig. 2C with the suspended microisland devices (Fig. 4A). At room temperature, \u03c3 is 282 S/cm and S is 79 \u03bcV/K. Temperaturedependent \u03c3 exhibits metallic behavior, and the positive sign of S indicates a hole-dominant (p-type) semiconductor, in agreement with previous studies (24).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBoth of these halide perovskites have been investigated for potential applications in solution-processed optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics (12,13), light-emitting diodes (14,15), and lasers (16,17). However, fundamental study of thermal transport in halide perovskites has been significantly lacking despite its practical and fundamental importance. For HHP, very few experimental studies have been performed for thermal conductivity (18,19) and an ultralow thermal conductivity value of 0.5 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 has been reported for single-crystalline CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Computational study revealed that the main reason for the ultralow thermal conductivity of HHP is rotational motions of organic CH 3 NH 3 + ions (20)(21)(22). For instance, Hata et al. computationally demonstrated the critical role of CH 3 NH 3 + rotations by comparing results with A-site cations possessing different degrees of freedom, where the elimination of the rotational degree of freedom results in greater thermal conductivity by a factor of \u223c2 (20).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhile limited investigations of thermal transport in HHP have been reported and some aspects of thermal transport in HHP are understood, fundamental understanding of thermal transport in AIHP remains largely elusive. The thermal transport mechanism in AIHP is expected to be fundamentally different from that in HHP, since vibrational density of states in organic and inorganic ions are largely mismatched for HHP, and monoatomic Cs + in AIHP does not contain rotational modes in contrast to the CH 3 NH 3 + ion in HHP (20,21). Here, we synthesize AIHP CsPbI 3 , CsPbBr 3 , and CsSnI 3 nanowires (NWs) via solution processes, measure their ultralow thermal conductivity, and elucidate fundamental thermal Significance Discovery of materials with low thermal conductivity in simple, fully dense, and single-crystalline solids has proven extremely challenging.

Using the cavity method of statistical physics and its relationship to belief propagation, we unveil a phase transition from a regime where we can infer the correct group assignments of the nodes to one where these groups are undetectable. Our approach yields an optimal inference algorithm for detecting modules, including both assortative and disassortative functional modules, assessing their significance, and learning the parameters of the underlying block model. Our algorithm is scalable and applicable to real-world networks, as long as they are well described by the block model. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUsing a cavity method analysis, we unveil a phase transition from a region where the original group assignment is undetectable to one where detection is possible. In some cases, the detectable region splits into an algorithmically hard region and an easy one. Our approach naturally translates into a practical algorithm for detecting modules in sparse networks, and learning the parameters of the underlying model.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIn many networks, ranging from online communities to food webs, metabolic networks, and genetic regulatory networks, there are communities or modules that play distinct functional roles. A fundamental problem is to detect these communities and understand what role they play in the network's structure and dynamics. In social networks, these communities are often assortative, meaning that there is a higher density of connections within communities than between them, and many approaches to detecting these communities have been proposed (see e.g. [1]). In other networks, however, these modules may consist of nodes with few connections to each other, but which connect to the rest of the network in similar ways.In this Letter we analyze a random generative model for sparse modular networks, known as the stochastic block model.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor q = 4 the best fixed point corresponds to a splitting of the two actual groups into high-degree and low-degree subgroups.The results obtained with MC, which can be easily equilibrated for such a small network, are almost identical to those of BP in terms of the parameters and marginals, and identical in terms of the estimated group assignments. This demonstrates that BP is a useful approach even on real, finite networks that are far from trees.Conclusion. We have presented a principled and asymptotically exact analysis of the detection of communities in networks generated by the stochastic block model. There is a strict limit on detectability due to a transition from a phase where the free energy landscape lets us infer the model's parameters, to a phase where it does not. In some cases the communities are detectable, but the problem is hard because the attractive region around the correct fixed point is exponentially small. Our analysis comes with an associated learning algorithm, which for large sparse networks generated from the model is able to learn the number of groups, their exact sizes, and the affinity matrix p ab .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt provides a useful playground for theoretical ideas and the analysis of algorithms, and is a popular model for functional modules in real networks. Using the cavity method developed in the physics of disordered systems [2,3] we exactly analyze the detectability of these modules in the limit of large sparse networks. As a function of the parameters, we compute the phase diagram and locate the associated phase transitions.We distinguish between a detectable phase where it is possible to learn the model's parameters and the group assignments of the nodes, and a non-intuitive undetectable phase where learning is impossible because the network's topology does not retain enough information about the original group memberships. The existence of a phase where a certain class of algorithms is unable to detect communities was previously predicted [4], but its location was only found approximately (and its size overestimated).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These methods require specification of the exact nature of the association between the network and attributes, reduce the network data to a small number of summary statistics, and are unable provide predictions simultaneously for missing attribute and network information. Existing methods that model the attributes and network jointly also assume the data are fully observed. In this article we introduce a unified approach to analysis that addresses these shortcomings. We use a previously developed latent variable model to obtain a low dimensional representation of the network in terms of node-specific network factors. We introduce a novel testing procedure to determine if dependencies exist between the network factors and attributes as a surrogate for a test of dependence between the network and attributes. We also present a joint model for the network relations and attributes, for use if the hypothesis of independence is rejected, that can capture a variety of dependence patterns and be used to make inference and predictions for missing observations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe key distinction between the previous methods and those presented here is that our method does not involve any model selection procedures and simultaneously tests and estimates first and second order dependencies between the network and attributes.Although the methods presented here are able to address questions about association between attributes and network relations based on a single cross-sectional dataset, the ultimate goal of much research in the social and biological sciences is to determine causal relationships using temporal network and attribute data. For example, sociologists are interested in determining whether students' friendships impact their health behaviors or whether health behaviors cause changes in their friendship networks (Bauman and Ennett (1996)). Snijders et al. (2007) and Steglich et al. (2010) propose methods for modeling the co-evolution of networks and behaviors using actor-oriented processes whereby actors dictate changes in their behaviors and outgoing ties. These methods focus on binary data, rely on method of moments estimation procedures, and are not applicable to cross-section datasets since they model network and attribute changes conditional on the first observation.A key advantage of the latent variable model approach here is that it warrants a formal testing procedure void of any model selection procedures.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n530BD5EE3D1708229F6AC07560B63CB4\n\t\t\t\t\t10.1080/01621459.2015.1008697\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\thypothesis test\n\t\t\t\t\tjoint model\n\t\t\t\t\tlatent variable model\n\t\t\t\t\tprediction\n\t\t\t\t\trelational data\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nNetwork analysis is often focused on characterizing the dependencies between network relations and node-level attributes.

Though such a technology does not yet exist, the technical hurdles for fabricating minimally disruptive, solid-state electrical probes have arguably been overcome in the field of nanotechnology. Nanoscale devices can be patterned with features on the same length scale as biological components, and several groups have demonstrated that nanoscale electrical probes can measure the transmembrane potential of electrogenic cells. Developing these nascent technologies into robust intracellular recording tools will now require a better understanding of device-cell interactions, especially the membrane-inorganic interface. Here we review the state-of-the art in nanobioelectronics, emphasizing the characterization and design of stable interfaces between nanoscale devices and cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDesigning over orders of magnitudeEngineering the nanoscale interaction between cells and electrodes may be the fundamental challenge to massively parallel intracellular recordings, but a complete in vivo recording system presents additional technical obstacles. For instance, each recording site must transmit information out of the brain (>millimeters) to downstream electronics, which can become logistically challenging as the number and density of the electrodes increases. While up to 512 electrodes have been accommodated by flexible connectors [19], dramatically larger numbers of electrodes are probably to require multiplexing and/or wireless transmission. Electrode arrays of up to 26,400 electrodes have been achieved in vitro with multiplexing [96], but such a demonstration has yet to be achieved in vivo. Finally, electrode micromotions within the brain can disrupt the recording if the electrode moves relative to the cell [97]. Ideally the recording site could move independently from the rest of the electronics, such as a wireless device on the brain surface [98] or a soft physical tether to the outside world [19].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nActive mechanical stabilization has been used to correct the micromotion of rigid glass microelectrodes in vivo [97], but high density recordings will more probably rely on the compliance of flexible micro-wires or nanowires arrays [99,100] to passively decouple recordings sites from recording electronics. Such a design will be particularly important for awake recordings, where animal movement requires special attention to electrode stabilization [101]. Indeed, motivated by the difficulty of interfacing rigid structures with brain, there is much ongoing work adapting flexible electronic materials for use in neuroscience [102,103]. Flexibly tethered recordings present a different problem, however, as they cannot be delivered deep within the brain without the aid of a rigid shuttle [102,103] or other means of providing reversible rigidity during insertion [104,105].\nConclusionNanoscale devices show great promise for intracellular electrical recording and have indeed already been usedNanotechnology and neurophysiology Angle, Cui and Melosh 137 for specific applications such as electrophysiological phenotyping of IPSC-derived cardiac cells [86]. Stable, non-invasive intracellular electrical recording will require much more careful attention interactions between nanoscale devices and the cell membrane.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause metallic conductors have greater than 10 7 times higher conductivity compared to typical electrolyte solutions, there is a specific scaling argument for reducing the cross-sectional area of the electrode leads by switching to solid-state devices. Finally, though impressive strides have been made toward the automation and parallelizing patch clamp technique in vivo [57], the mechanical requirements for pressure control (i.e. pipette rigidity) are not commensurate with massively parallel recordings. Nanofabrication on the other hand is designed for parallelization, routinely producing intricate structures at the same length scales as cellular components (3-30 nm), meaning that devices can be engineered to interact with cells at a subcellular level [37 ,42 ].

However, most touch panels have been developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes. We demonstrate an ionic touch panel based on a polyacrylamide hydrogel containing lithium chloride salts. The panel is soft and stretchable, so it can sustain a large deformation. The panel can freely transmit light information because the hydrogel is transparent, with 98% transmittance for visible light. A surface-capacitive touch system was adopted to sense a touched position. The panel can be operated under more than 1000% areal strain without sacrificing its functionalities. Epidermal touch panel use on skin was demonstrated by writing words, playing a piano, and playing games. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs shown in Fig. 4D, we subsequently touched from TP#1 to TP#4 on the epidermal touch panel, and the current was measured with the A1 current meter. The correlation between the measured currents and the touched position was not influenced by the attachment. The epidermal touch panel could successfully perceive various motions, such as tapping, holding, dragging, and swiping. Thus, various applications can be easily managed by integrating the panel. As shown in Fig. 4, E to G, writing words (Fig. 4E), playing music (Fig. 4F), and playing chess (Fig. 4G) were accomplished via adequate motions on the epidermal touch panel (movies S3 to S6).We have demonstrated a highly stretchable and transparent ionic touch panel. We used a PAAm hydrogel containing 2 M LiCl salts as an ionic conductor. We investigated the mechanism of position-sensing in an ionic touch panel with a 1D strip. The ionic touch strip showed precise and fast touch-sensing, even in a highly stretched state. We expanded the positionsensing mechanism to a 2D panel.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1E), the parasitic capacitance of the strip increased because of the area expansion. Thus, the baseline current and the touching current both increased compared with that of the nonstretched states. In the stretched states, the currents also showed similar negative linear correlations with the interval of the electrode and the touch points. A 2D hydrogel panel was tested in order to detect the position of the touch point. As shown in Fig. 2, A andC, a thin hydrogel film, rectangular in shape, was connected to the Pt electrodes at each corner. Four current meters were also installed between the voltage source and each corner. Two normalized distances, a and b, were used to indicate the position of the touch on the panel. The bottom left corner of the panel corresponded to (a, b) = (0, 0), and the top right corner corresponded to (a, b) = (1, 1). When the panel is touched by a finger, it can be virtually divided into four resistive sections by the touch point (Fig. 2B).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, most touch panels have been developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes.

We thoroughly investigated temperature-dependent polarization, dielectric, and impedance spectroscopies, and we found no evidence of ferroelectric effect in a MAPbI3 thin film at normal operating conditions. Therefore, the effect does not contribute to the hysteresis in PSCs, whereas the large component of ionic migration observed may play a critical role. Our temperature-based polarization and dielectric studies find that MAPbI3 exhibits different electrical behaviors below and above ca. 45 \u00b0C, suggesting a phase transition around this temperature. In particular, we report the activation energies of ionic migration for the two phases and temperature-dependent permittivity of MAPbI3. This study contributes to the understanding of the material properties and device performance of hybrid perovskites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe temperature dependence of dielectric loss and conductivity (Fig. S9) also suggests a phase transition between 40 o C-50 o C.

Such a strong dependence of dielectric permittivity, particularly at low frequencies, is not a favorable sign of a ferroelectric nature of the material. At low frequencies, the value of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032 increases with temperature, whereas at high frequencies the trend is opposite but at a much smaller rate.

Such a behavior is typical for relaxation processes, found in the generic Debye expression of permitivity. 37 Considering the low frequency and broad peak feature, this relaxation process could be a Maxwell-Wagner type interfacial polarization relaxation, possibly attributed to grain boundary effects or blocking at the contacts. The dielectric loss tangent of the material was found to be high at lower frequencies, especially at lower temperature. The peak value of loss tangent shifts toward higher frequency as the temperature is increased (~1 Hz for 10 o C to ~200Hz for 70 o C). Moreover, the loss tangent starts increasing with temperature at >100 Hz, and below this frequency the loss tangent decreases with increasing temperature.

This study presents the large-scale features of the simulated climates and compares the new model results to those of the atmospheric models from the first phase of the PMIP, for which sea surface temperature was prescribed or computed using simple slab ocean formulations. We consider the large-scale features of the climate change, pointing out some of the major differences between the different sets of experiments. We show in particular that systematic differences between PMIP1 and PMIP2 simulations are due to the interactive ocean, such as the amplification of the African monsoon at the Mid-Holocene or the change in precipitation in mid-latitudes at the LGM. Also the PMIP2 simulations are in general in better agreement with data than PMIP1 simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThese changes are very similar to the results found from PMIP1 SSTf and SSTc experiments, which suggests that the dominant factors contributing to the drying is the large-scale cooling which contribute to reduce evaporation over the tropical ocean, and the reduction of the inland moisture transport.For the Mid-Holocene, the new results confirm that the response of the ocean and sea-ice shape the changes in the seasonal cycle of the surface air temperature and precipitation. The sea-ice has a large effect in high latitudes, and in particular in the NH where its reduction during boreal summer strengthens the warming. In the tropical regions, the monsoons are enhanced both over West Africa and over the north of India. Comparison with data shows that the coupled simulations better reproduce the change in precipitation over west Africa, even though the amount of precipitation is still underestimated in most simulations and would not sustain steppe as far as 23 \u2022 N. It also shows that the ocean feedback strengthens the monsoon amplification over Africa and damps it over India. Vegetation feedbacks enhance the signal in some models, but reduce it in others.Common features emerge from the comparison of the two time periods.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMid-HoloceneChanges are modest compared to those of the LGM, but reflect the sensitivity of the climate system to changes in the mean seasonal cycle of insolation. In particular, there is nearly no simulated change in annual mean temperature or precipitation for the Mid-Holocene, consistent with no change in global annual mean insolation. The major changes for this period compared to present correspond to an enhanced (reduced) seasonal cycle of temperature in the NH (SH). The continental warming favours the deepening of the JJAS thermal low over land, which intensifies the low level    winds and moisture transport from the tropical ocean to the continent, and thereby intensifies monsoon system in the tropical regions (Kutzbach et al., 1993;Joussaume et al., 1999).All models simulate an amplification of the mean seasonal cycle of NH surface temperature. In summer, this is characterised by increased surface air temperature over NH continents and in mid and high latitudes over the ocean and the Arctic (Fig. 6). The continental warming reaches a maximum of about 2 \u2022 C in central Eurasia and over the Tibetan Plateau in the PMIP2 simulations (Fig. 6a).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAfrican and Indian monsoons at the Mid-HoloceneThe change in MH precipitation over West Africa has been a key focus of PMIP1. Figure 9a shows that the response of PMIP2 OA MH simulation in JJAS ranges from 0.2 mm/d to 1.6 mm/d (5 to 140%). Both OA and OAV simulations tend to produce larger precipitation changes in this region than PMIP1 SSTf experiments. This increase in precipitation is due to the response of the ocean and the building up of warmer conditions in the subtropics and mid latitudes in the Atlantic north of the equator and colder conditions in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 6). This strengthens the cross equatorial flow and favours the maintenance of the ITCZ to the north of its present day position in West Africa and the nearby ocean (Kutzbach and Liu, 1997;Braconnot et al., 2000;Zhao et al., 2005).The expansion of the area influenced by the Afro-Asian summer monsoon during MH is one of the most striking features shown by palaeoenvironmental data (Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We demonstrate that in space-charge limited diodes the hole mobility (micro(h)) of a large variety of organic semiconductors shows a universal Arrhenius temperature dependence micro(h)(T) = micro(0)exp(-Delta/kT) at low fields, due to the presence of extrinsic carriers from the Ohmic contact. The transport in a range of organic semiconductors, with a variation in room temperature mobility of more than 6 orders of magnitude, is characterized by a universal mobility micro(0) of 30-40 cm(2)/V s. As a result, we can predict the full temperature dependence of their charge transport properties with only the mobility at one temperature known. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFurthermore, in order to explain the observed electric field dependence within this Gaussian disorder model an additional spatial correlated potential for the charge carriers is needed, which could arise from charge-dipole interactions [6]. However, in contrast to the empirical relation Eq. ( 1) the simulations showed a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the mobility at low fields, given by / exp \u00ff 2=3kT 2 , where is the width of the Gaussian DOS [5].Recently, also the dependence of h on the carrier density in a PPV derivative has been investigated by a combined study on polymeric diodes and field-effect transistors [8]. It has been demonstrated that the hole mobility is constant for charge carrier densities typically <10 22 m \u00ff3 and increases with a power law with density for carrier densities >10 22 m \u00ff3 . In contrast to the earlier assumption [4] the enhancement of the mobility at higher voltages in SCL diodes at room temperature has been shown to be totally due to the increase of the carrier density instead of the electric field [9]. However, at lower temperatures the field dependence of the mobility becomes increasingly more important.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor sufficiently high densities [Fig. 1(b)], meaning E f > E eq , it has been demonstrated by Coehoorn that also within the Gaussian disorder model the transport is governed by an Arrhenius-like ln / 1=T behavior [12], as often observed in organic transistors [13,14]. Experimentally, the question whether the transport in organic semiconductors is better described by a ln / 1=T 2 or ln / 1=T [Eq. ( 1)] behavior has been addressed by Borsenberger et al. [15]. From time-of-flight (TOF) measurements on vapor-deposited 1,1-bis(di-4tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane they convincingly demonstrated that the non-Arrhenius ln / 1=T 2 provides a more consistent description of the charge transport. However, in the analysis of various charge transport measurements an important aspect has been ignored: in TOF studies thick samples ( > 1 m) are used with blocking contacts to prevent charge injection.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe solid line is the prediction made from Eq. ( 4). The good agreement for semiconductors that differ by 6 orders of magnitude in h 0; 300 K shows the validity of the Arrhenius-like transport in all of these SCL diodes.In conclusion, we demonstrate that the mobilities of a variety of organic semiconductors are consistent with an Arrhenius temperature dependent transport with a universal prefactor 0 30 cm 2 =V s. The carriers diffusing into the diodes from the Ohmic contact lift the Fermi level above the equilibrium level, resulting in an Arrheniuslike temperature dependence instead of the characteristic ln h 1=T 2 behavior as observed for blocking contacts. As a result, the temperature dependence of the charge transport can be predicted when the mobility at one single temperature is known.   I).

We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems there appears a gapless phase between the QSH and insulator phases in 3D which is in contrast with the 2D case. Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless points (diabolical points) in 3D, but not in 2D. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe present one example. In [7], we constructed a fourband tight-binding model for HgTe. It is a zero-gap system, but by opening a gap with uniaxial pressure, it becomes a band insulator. The question here is whether it is a simple insulator or a topological insulator (i.e. QSH). In fact, from the parities of the bands below the Fermi energy E F from the four-band model in [7], the Z 2 topological number \u03bd turns out to be even. This disagrees with the result in [18]. The reason for the disagreement is the following. This model only has four bands near the Fermi energy E F , and the other bands well below E F are discarded. In HgTe, one doubly-degenerate band just below the Fermi energy has a trivial Z 2 topological number, while the other discarded bands deep below the Fermi energy have a nontrivial Z 2 topological number; this leads to the seemingly contradicting results.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis might be attributed as an intrinsic SHE caused by near-degeneracy near the Fermi energy [6].Henceforth, we restrict ourselves to time-reversal-symmetric systems. In relation to the SHE in conducting systems, there has been a growing interest in the SHE in insulating systems. The first proposal is spin Hall insulators [7]. It was shown that in insulators such as HgTe under uniaxial pressure or in PbTe the spin Hall conductivity is nonzero. In a sense, they are ordinary insulators with spin-orbit coupling. Another proposal is quantum spin Hall (QSH) systems, both in two dimensions (2D) [8]- [10] and in 3D [11,12]. They are insulators in the bulk while the boundaries (i.e. edges in 2D or surfaces in 3D) are gapless and carry spin currents. They can be regarded as topological insulators; these gapless boundary states are topologically protected against T-symmetric perturbations [13,14]. Experimental observations are yet to be made.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn contrast, for the QSH phase (\u03bd = odd), the edge states remain gapless even in the presence of T-symmetric perturbation, including nonmagnetic impurities and/or interaction, as long as they are not too strong [13,14].There are a number of equivalent expressions for the Z 2 topological number [11,17,18], and we only explain the ones relevant for the subsequent discussions, both in 2D and in 3D. We assume that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian has a gap, within which the Fermi energy E F is located.\n4First we explain the 2D case. For I-asymmetric systems, the spectrum is doubly degenerate only at the four points k = k i \u2261 G/2 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), and non-degenerate at other points. In such systems, the Z 2 topological number \u03bd is determined as(-1) \u03bd = 4 i=1 \u03b4 i ,(1)where\u03b4 i = \u221a det[w(k i )] Pf[w(k i )] = \u00b11.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We identify signatures of this Weyl point in the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states, observable in thermodynamic properties. Tunneling between the electron and hole pockets in a magnetic field is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p-n junction in real space. This magnetic breakdown happens at a characteristic field strength that vanishes when the Fermi level approaches the Weyl point. The topological distinction between connected and disconnected pairs of type-II Weyl cones can be distinguished by the qualitatively different dependence of the quantum oscillations on the direction of the magnetic field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1). Here we investigate how this process, a momentum space manifestation of Klein tunneling [22], affects the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states (de Haas-van Alphen effect), providing a unique thermodynamic signature of the topologically protected band structure (an alternative to proposed transport signatures [9,[23][24][25]). Because the quantum oscillations are governed by extremal cross sections of the Fermi surface, one might wonder whether some symmetry is required to align the extremal cross section with the Weyl point, so that it becomes observable. Our analysis shows that a magnetic field axis for this alignment exists generically, because of the M\u00f6bius strip topology of the projective plane. We first consider Klein tunneling through a single type-II Weyl point, and then turn to pairs of Weyl cones of opposite helicity, which can be combined in topologically distinct ways [8]-with a qualitatively different dependence on the Klein tunneling probability.To first order in momentum k, the Hamiltonian of a Weyl cone has the generic form Tunneling between the pockets happens with a probability T that tends to unity when their minimal separation \u0394k \u2192 0.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAAZyuzin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRPTiwari\n\t\t\n\t\tarXiv:1601.00890\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIntrinsic anomalous hall effect in type-II Weyl semimetals\n\t\t\n\t\n\tto be published\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZYu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYYao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSAYang\n\t\t\n\t\tarXiv:1604.04030\n\t\tUnusual magneto-response in type-II Weyl semimetals\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNWAshcroft\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNDMermin\n\t\t\n\t\tSolid State Physics\n\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCengage Learning\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCMWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tH.-ZLu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tS.-QShen\n\t\t\n\t\tarXiv:1604.01681\n\t\tAnomalous phase shift of quantum oscillation in 3D topological semimetals\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInterpretation of the de Haas-van Alphen effect\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLOnsager\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1080/14786440908521019\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPhilos.

Because of the high structural and chemical variability of polymers that can be created by synthetic approaches, thin films composed of polymers are especially useful in creating a wide range of stimuli-responsive structures. Moreover, since polymer thin films can be patterned by a number of planar techniques such as photolithography, molding, or imprinting, a variety of precisely patterned 2D precursors can be used to fold-up functional structures such as tubular, spherical and polyhedral capsules, biomimetic actuators and even microsurgical tools.

To create biochemically responsive reversible self-folding structures, it would be necessary to utilize thin bi-layers or bi-strips composed of novel polymers such as glucose [63] or antigen responsive [64] gels. In doing so, it may be possible to create a range of biosensing actuators to enable autonomous functions and biomimetic behaviors. Additionally, while such stimuli responsive structures have been demonstrated at the molecular and the 100 mm to 1 cm length scales, the intermediate 0.1 to 1 mm scale remains relatively unexplored, mainly owing to challenges in patterning polymers and hydrogels with these dimensions. It is noteworthy that self-folding methods work at these size scales and 100 nm scaled metallic self-folding polyhedra have already been achieved, [65] but similarly sized stimuli responsive polymeric self-folding structures have yet to be demonstrated.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy the use of photomasks and on conditioning such SU8 films, a variety of stimuli responsive structures such as arrays of flower-like structures (Figure 4A) or metamaterial sheets were created. Metamaterials are periodic materials, often composed of heterogeneous components with a large refractive index contrast, thus featuring novel electromagnetic properties. In our studies, the contrast was achieved by patterning metallic resonators on a polymeric substrate, and the metamaterial sheets crumpled or flattened out on solvent exchange which induced solvation and desolvation of the films, and consequently reversible self-folding at differentially cross-linked hinges. The ability to create stimuli-responsive metamaterials offers the possibility for the realization of adaptive optical and electromagnetic coatings. Kim et al. have shown that differentially cross-linked NIPAM bistrips with lateral swelling heterogeneities show interesting thermally responsive shape transformations (Figure 4B) [52,53], which could potentially be utilized to create novel stimuli-responsive structures.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Numerous studies have detected significant changes in the observed occurrence of extreme heat events, irrespective of how such events are defined. Further, a number of these studies have attributed present-day changes in the risk of individual heat events and the documented global-scale increase in such events to anthropogenic-driven warming. Advances in process-based studies of heat events have focused on the proximate land-atmosphere interactions through soil moisture anomalies, and changes in occurrence of the underlying atmospheric circulation associated with heat events in the midlatitudes. While evidence for a number of hypotheses remains limited, climate change nevertheless points to tail risks of possible changes in heat extremes that could exceed estimates generated from model outputs of mean temperature. We also explore risks associated with compound extreme events and nonlinear impacts associated with extreme heat. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNote that the two mechanisms are active areas of research, and as such their theoretical basis in either the observed or future climate is not established. However, the two hypotheses would be consistent with nonlinear increases in extreme heat events. Furthermore, the hypotheses complement one another as both account for reduced summer weather variability at synoptic time scales, and there is some evidence that both are occurring in boreal summer [21].\n\"Resonant\" Circulation RegimesPlanetary wave influence on midlatitude weather in all seasons is a topic of active research. In the boreal midlatitude summer, amplifying interactions among standing (quasistationary) Rossby waves and fast-moving (free) Rossby waves of similar wavenumber (e.g., 6-8) have been proposed as being critical in producing long-standing heatwaves and other extreme events [17,18,20,21,23,37,44]. This \"quasi-resonance\" of Rossby waves is associated with a double jet stream that traps Rossby waves within a latitudinal band, or waveguide [17,21,45].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, they caution that the larger amplitude subtropical stationary waves could be due to other factors besides differential warming, such as wavemean flow interactions with an anthropogenically strengthened subtropical jet [72].Differential warming of land and ocean may indirectly impact heat waves by changing the timing and intensity of monsoons; in many regions, the arrival of the monsoon-with its cloud cover and moisture induced cooling-brings an end to the hottest period of the year, especially as defined by daytime highs. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concluded that, globally, monsoon precipitation was likely to increase this century, with increases in monsoon precipitation extremes very likely in several regions [73].\nTropical ForcingRecent studies have challenged the conventional view that Rossby waves of tropical origin only minimally impact summer midlatitude temperature anomalies (due to weaker tropical modes like ENSO and the inability of Rossby waves to propagate through the easterly wind regimes common in summer) [20,37]. Other studies (e.g., Ding et al. [55]) have demonstrated that tropical SST anomalies may warm the Arctic, which could in turn impact the midlatitudes, as described in the section \"Planetary Wave Forcing of Persistent Boreal Summer Heat Events?.\"\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor example, Xu et al. [68] project reduced duration of tropical heat waves, because aerosol cooling results in an equatorward shift of the Hadley cell edge, and thus more frequent intrusions of midlatitude air and a decrease in periods of extended stagnation.\nDifferential Warming of Land and OceanClimate change is in general expected to warm land more than ocean, which could impact heat waves in multiple ways. Model experiments have confirmed the intuition that increasing summer temperature gradients due to differential land and ocean warming can be an important source of increased summer temperature variability, locally rivaling or exceeding the individual impacts of any changes in circulation or land surface/radiative fluxes [70,71]. Shaw and Voigt [72] propose that differential land versus ocean warming is one possible explanation for an observed and modeled amplification of subtropical stationary waves in summer-a likely driver for more extreme temperatures.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It is then crucial to establish whether the constituent elements of the perovskite are present in the desired perovskite form (i.e., CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) or in other forms (PbI 3 or PbI 2 , etc.) as this would allow to compare the perovskite conversion efficiency associated with the each conversion method and environment and determine ionic diffusion testified by the presence of strong signals from iodine fragments.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIncomplete perovskite infiltration can be seen in samples A and D.

Geochronological tests of this hypothesis have been limited by a dearth of reliable age constraints bracketing these events on multiple cratons. Here we present four new Re-Os geochronology age constraints on Sturtian (717\u2013660 Ma) and Marinoan (635 Ma termination) glacial deposits from three different paleocontinents. A 752.7 \u00b1 5.5 Ma age from the base of the Callison Lake Formation in Yukon, Canada, confirms nonglacial sedimentation on the western margin of Laurentia between ca. 753 and 717 Ma. Coupled with a new 727.3 \u00b1 4.9 Ma age directly below the glacigenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate on the Congo craton (Africa), these data refute the notion of a global ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. A 659.0 \u00b1 4.5 Ma age directly above the Maikhan-Uul diamictite in Mongolia confirms previous constraints on a long duration for the 717\u2013660 Ma Sturtian glacial epoch and a relatively short nonglacial interlude. In addition, we provide the first direct radiometric age constraint for the termination of the Marinoan glaciation in Laurentia with an age of 632.3 \u00b1 5.9 Ma from the basal Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada, which is identical, within uncertainty, to U-Pb zircon ages from China, Australia, and Namibia.

The Os i data presented here confi rm enhanced weathering of juvenile crustal material prior to the onset of the Sturtian glacial epoch, consistent with a basalt weathering trigger for initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch (e.g., Godd\u00e9ris et al., 2003;Rooney et al., 2014). These ages confi rm the central prediction of the snowball Earth hypothesis of long-lived (~10 m.y.) glaciation with globally synchronous deglaciation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Sharad  Figure 1.

These data refute the evidence for an earlier global Kaigas glaciation and suggest instead that the initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch ca. 717 Ma marked the fi rst unambiguous glacial event in more than a billion years. Together with existing geochronological data, the new Re-Os ages constrain the onset and demise of the long-lasting (717-660 Ma) Sturtian glacial epoch and further bolster correlations for the end-Cryogenian Marinoan glaciation ca. 635 Ma (Fig. 3). The long duration (>55 m.y.) of the Sturtian glacial epoch implies a relatively short Cryogenian nonglacial interlude (<25 m.y.), consistent with a repeated trigger for glaciation related to the tectonic background conditions that drive weathering and the consumption of CO 2 on 1-10 m.y. time scales (Mills et al., 2011).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n850-635 Ma) strata record arguably the most extreme episodes of climate change in Earth's history. The widespread occurrence of lowlatitude glacial deposits on every paleocontinent, coupled with the unique geochemistry and sedimentology of cap carbonates (Hoffman et al., 1998;Bao et al., 2008), inspired the snowball Earth hypothesis (Kirschvink, 1992). However, the general paucity of radiometric age constraints from multiple paleocontinents for the onset and demise of Cryogenian glaciations (Sturtian ca. 717-660 Ma, and Marinoan ending ca. 635 Ma), as well as reports of putative pre-Sturtian glaciations (Frimmel et al., 1996), has fostered doubts about the synchronicity and global extent of these events (e.g., Allen and Etienne, 2008;Kendall et al., 2006).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A total of 274 sequences were analyzed and assigned 48.00% Proteobacteria, 10.30% Actinobacteria, 9.90% Bacteroidetes, 6.60% Verrucomicrobia, 4.80% Acidobacteria, 1.80% Firmicutes, 1.50% Chloroflexi, 1.50% TM7, 1.10% Deinococcus-Thermus, 0.70% Planctomycetes, 0.70% Gemmatimonadetes and 0.40% Cyanobacteria. Economically important phyla Actinobacteria was second most dominant group after Proteobacteria, in our clone library. It would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. An additional 12.8% of clone library (35 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) from 43 clones) with less than 94% similarity to any GenBank sequence could not be assigned to any known phylum and may represent unidentified bacterial lineages and suggests that a large amount of the rhizobacterial diversity remains to be characterized by culturing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHowever extra data are necessary, to prove occurrence of new phylotypes, as only a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed.The observation that sequences related to Proteobacteria phylum made up the largest fraction of clone library in this study is consistent with previous findings that the phylum Proteobacteria, which is metabolically versatile and genetically diverse, comprises the largest frac-  tion of the bacterial community in soil ecosystems, including the rhizosphere [26]. The representation of genera Devosia is interesting as, previously these genera have been detected as a nitrogen fixing nodule former in Neptunia natans (L.f.) Druce [27], other dominant phylotypes were relatives of well known genera Rhizobium/ Mesorhizobium/ Rhodoplanes. 16S rRNA gene fragments related to Rhizobium was also recovered from maize roots and it was noted that pea was grown in the field site prior to maize cultivation [28]. It is also possible that Rhizobium is a native member of non-legume rhizospheres [29]. Pseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria. Cloned 16S rRNA genes affiliated with Pseudomonas were also infrequently recovered from rhizosphere soil samples [30].Pseudoxanthomonas has been known to use as bioremediation as reported earlier by Sanchez et al. [31]. Most interestingly, the economically important phyla Actinobacteria was the second dominant group in our clone library, and among most dominant OTUs with 5 clone sequences was close relative of genera Streptomyces. This genera is of economical importance because of its antibiotic producing ability. Streptomyces, act as antagonists to many different phytopathogenic fungi, detection of chitinolytic activity of Actinomycetes also makes them promising candidates as biocontrol agents for diverse fungal diseases. Presence of phyla Actinobacteria in the rhizosphere opens the possibility of exploring them to identify members with antagonistic properties toward some economically hazardous plant pathogens. An important decomposer of plant matter in the soil, this phylum has previously been shown to be abundant in some of these soils by culture-dependent and independent techniques [32].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. Likewise bacteria within the Bacteroidetes are known to be chemoorganotrophic and especially proficient in degrading various polymers and complex substrates in media such as cellulose, chitin, and pectin [33]. It has been reported earlier that the members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia have been shown to make up 1 to 10% of the bacterial 16S rRNA in soils, although most members of this phylum remains uncultivated. Some members of this group are among the most successful human pathogens, others are abundant soil microbes, and others still are of major importance for the marine nitrogen cycle and hold much promise for sustainable wastewater treatment [34]. In the maize rhizosphere 10 OTUs belong to phylum Acidobacteria were related to uncul-tured bacteria.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show that the properties of whole ecosystems can also be shaped by artificial selection procedures. Ecosystems initiated in the laboratory vary phenotypically and a proportion of the variation is heritable, despite the fact that the ecosystems initially are composed of thousands of species and millions of individuals. Artificial ecosystem selection can be used for practical purposes, illustrates an important role for complex interactions in evolution, and challenges a widespread belief that selection is most effective at lower levels of the biological hierarchy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt has many practical applications and encourages us to look for a similar process of natural ecosystem selection. The main reason that it has not been attempted before seems to be conceptual. Perhaps because it was regarded as theoretically implausible, it simply didn't occur to biologists to look for heritable phenotypic variation at the level of ecosystems, which allows their properties to be shaped by standard artificial selection procedures.This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant DEB-9707650 to D.S.W. and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Biological Sciences grant to R.E.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

Each line consisted of 15 units and the 3 units with the highest (or lowest) value of the phenotypic trait were used as parents by combining the soil from the 3 units into a slurry that was used to inoculate the ''offspring'' generation of units. Fifteen microcosms per generation for the high and low treatments of the 6.0-g and 0.06-g inoculum sizes and two control treatments led to a total of 90 microcosms per generation for the complete experiment, which was continued for 16 35-day ecosystem generations.

Although the revolution in DNA sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic-level information, the biogeography of microbiomes is almost entirely uncharted at the micron scale. Using spectral imaging fluorescence in situ hybridization as guided by metagenomic sequence analysis, we have discovered a distinctive, multigenus consortium in the microbiome of supragingival dental plaque. The consortium consists of a radially arranged, nine-taxon structure organized around cells of filamentous corynebacteria. The consortium ranges in size from a few tens to a few hundreds of microns in radius and is spatially differentiated. Within the structure, individual taxa are localized at the micron scale in ways suggestive of their functional niche in the consortium. For example, anaerobic taxa tend to be in the interior, whereas facultative or obligate aerobes tend to be at the periphery of the consortium. Consumers and producers of certain metabolites, such as lactate, tend to be near each other. Based on our observations and the literature, we propose a model for plaque microbiome development and maintenance consistent with known metabolic, adherence, and environmental considerations. The consortium illustrates how complex structural organization can emerge from the micron-scale interactions of its constituent organisms. The understanding that plaque community organization is an emergent phenomenon offers a perspective that is general in nature and applicable to other microbiomes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWith deep sequencing, it has become clear that many taxa in the oral microbiota are shared across individuals but are abundant in some samples and almost vanishingly rare in others (19,38). These differences in abundance may result from real differences between individuals, fluctuations within a single individual over time, or a combination of the two. Whatever its cause, the lack of a consistently abundant microbial \"core\" has led to the idea that perhaps it is not organisms but genes and functions that are conserved within the microbiome, distributed across a variety of organisms whose identities are irrelevant. The discovery of hedgehog consortia argues against this idea, at least for some microbiomes. The consistency of the composition and structure of the hedgehog across many individuals suggests that organisms are highly relevant to understanding the roles, organization, and dynamics of the members of the consortium. We suggest that it is neither necessary nor desirable to disregard taxonomy and reduce the microbiome to a collection of genes or metabolites unmoored from their source organism.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAlthough the revolution in DNA sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic-level information, the biogeography of microbiomes is almost entirely uncharted at the micron scale.

Thus, the overall similarity of distribution suggests a close connection between these two spatially adjacent communities.Plaque Microbiota Is Organized into Highly Structured, Multigenus Consortia. Bacteria are micron-sized and live in a chemical and structural environment with micron-scale heterogeneity. Therefore, an understanding of the micron-scale spatial organization of bacterial communities is necessary for understanding how these communities function. A striking degree of spatial organization can become visible, even with simple procedures, when plaque samples are prepared gently to retain their structure. For example, when plaque was spread out on a slide, conventional FISH with two probes revealed clumps of Corynebacterium, with long filaments that were coated at their tips by brightly staining cocci (Fig. 2). Associations between cocci and filaments in plaque were documented over 40 years ago and have been called \"corncobs\" (22,23).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) ) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2 -eq. yr(-1) ), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n), which was evaluated by assuming that demand reduction would linearly reduce all flows. As Table 2 shows, the combination of all measures results in a substantial reduction in cropland and grazing areas, even though the individual measures cannot be added up due to the interactions between the individual compartments shown in Fig. 1, and regional disparities considered in the biomass-balance model (Erb et al., 2012a,b).In all cases, former agricultural land (i.e. cropland plus grazing land area) would become available for nonfood purposes (afforestation or bioenergy crops) if stocking densities on grazing land were increased to higher, but still sustainable, levels; the latter were derived from spatially explicit data on the productivity of grazing areas (see Erb et al., 2009Erb et al., , 2012a,b;,b;Haberl et al., 2011). Table 2 shows the GHG reductions that could be achieved in 2050 by using the spare land for afforestation, assuming a CO 2 sequestration of 11.8 t CO 2 eq ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (based on Smith et al., 2000).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntegration of perennial grasses and woody plants into monocultural landscapes can similarly improve species diversity (Dimitriou et al., 2011). Reforestation may also provide a mechanism to fund translocation of biodiverse communities in response to climate change; \u2022 Improvements in sustainable agriculture: Stubble retention and minimum tillage may also increase crop yields and reduce the amount of wind and water erosion due to an increase in surface cover (Lal, 2001); agroforestry systems will reduce wind erosion by acting as wind breaks and may increase crop production as can biomass plantations. \u2022 Restoration of degraded land: Reforestation or bioenergy systems can be used to restore or stabilize degraded land (Wicke et al., 2011;Sochacki et al., 2012). In many cases, there is no economic incentive to restore such lands, and carbon mitigation may not only provide the capital to allow this to occur but also allow it to occur at watershed or catchment scales (Harper et al., 2007). \u2022 Increase in economic activity: Economic activity can increase through an increase in the overall capital available in particular systems and thus intensification.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause many ecosystem services are lost on such conversion, it is apparent that future increases in food supply need to be met without large increases in agricultural area, i.e. to derive more agricultural products from the same area (Godfray et al., 2010;Smith et al., 2010;Smith, 2012b).The main means of intensifying crop production will be through increased yields per unit area together with  (Smith et al., 2010). Put another way, had the increases in yield of the last 60-70 years not been achieved, almost three times more land would have been required to produce crops to sustain the present population; land that does not exist except by using some that is unsuitable for cropping. So some form of sustainable intensification of food production will be required (Garnett & Godfray, 2012). Smith (2012b) and Smith & Gregory (2013) recently reviewed the literature exploring options for sustainable intensification, which are outlined below. Tilman et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Geographic distribution of global agricultural lands in the year 2000 \nAbstract: Agricultural activities have dramatically altered our planet's land surface. To understand the extent and spatial distribution of these changes, we have developed a new global data set of croplands and pastures circa 2000 by combining agricultural inventory data and satellite-derived land cover data. The agricultural inventory data, with much greater spatial detail than previously available, is used to train a land cover classification data set obtained by merging two different satellite-derived products (Boston University's MODIS-derived land cover product and the GLC2000 data set). Our data are presented at 5 min (\u223c10 km) spatial resolution in longitude by longitude, have greater accuracy than previously available, and for the first time include statistical confidence intervals on the estimates. According to the data, there were 15.0 (90% confidence range of 12.2\u201317.1) million km2 of cropland (12% of the Earth's ice-free land surface) and 28.0 (90% confidence range of 23.6\u201330.0) million km2 of pasture (22%) in the year 2000. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[34] Our final predicted cropland extent of 15.0 million km 2 in year 2000 amounts to roughly 12% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), and pasture extent of 28.0 million km 2 amounts to 22% of global land area. Thus humans are using 34% of the global land area for their agricultural needs.\nGeographic Distribution of Croplands and Pastures in Year 2000[35] We analyzed the distribution of agricultural regions by 14 different regions of the world (Table 5). The greatest proportion of croplands in the world are found in South Asia, Europe, Southeast Asia, and United States, east of the Mississippi, while the greatest proportion of pastures are found in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, Pacific developed countries, China, Mexico and Central America, United States, west of the Mississippi, and tropical Africa. The smallest proportion of croplands are found in Canada, the Pacific developed Countries, and northern South America, while the smallest proportion of pastures are found in Southeast Asia, Canada, and United States, east of the Mississippi.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNearly 40% of the planet's ice-free land surface is now being used for agriculture, and much of this land has replaced forests, savannas, and grasslands [Foley et al., 2005]. Clearing of tropical forests for cultivation or grazing is responsible for $12 -26% of the total emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere [DeFries and Achard, 2002;Houghton, 2003], and land use changes can significantly modify regional and global climate [Pitman et al., 1999;Pielke et al., 2002]. Furthermore, $20-30% of the total available surface water on the planet is withdrawn for irrigation [Cassman and Wood, 2005], and nitrogen fixation through fertilizer production and crop cultivation currently equals or even exceeds natural biotic fixation [Galloway et al., 1995;Smil, 1999].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAccording to the data, there were 15.0 (90% confidence range of 12.2-17.1) million km 2 of cropland (12% of the Earth's ice-free land surface) and 28.0 (90% confidence range of 23.6-30.0) million km 2 of pasture (22%) in the year 2000.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n1. Introduction [2] Human land use activities are a force of global significance [Foley et al., 2005]. Humans have extensively modified the Earth's land surface, altering ecosystem structure and functioning, and diminishing the ability of ecosystems to continue providing valuable resources such as food, freshwater and forest resources, and services such as regulation of climate, air quality, water quality, soil resources.[3] Agricultural activities, in particular, have been responsible for a vast majority of these land use related ecosystem consequences [Richards, 1990;Tilman et al., 2001;Green et al., 2005].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Still, there is evidence of an \u201cemerging supermarket revolution in India\u201d [citation 37], driven by domestic capital.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Surprised by supermarkets: Diffusion of modern food retail in India \nAbstract: Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the patterns and dynamics of the diffusion of modern food retail in India.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper is based on detailed sales data from retail chains in India, short case studies of retail chains, and review of literature.\nFindings\nThe article presents three surprises concerning modern food retail diffusion in India. First, modern retail has developed in three \u201cwaves\u201d, with the first wave, government retail chains, starting in the 1960s/1970s, cooperative retail chains starting in the 1970s/1980s, and private retail chains in the 1990s/2000s. All three were substantial, and internationally uniquely, all three coexist in the 2000s as segments of modern retail. Second, the rise of modern private retail in India in the past six years has been among the fastest in the world, growing at 49 percent a year on average over that period, and bouncing back to growth after a dip from the recent recession. The great majority of modern private retail has arisen in 2007\u20102010. Third, beside the uniqueness of the coexistence of three types of retail noted above, Indian private retail chain development has unique or rare characteristics: driven by domestic capital investment, \u201cearly\u201d (in terms of usual international patterns) diversification into small formats, \u201cearly\u201d penetration of small cities and even rural towns, of the food markets of the poor and lower\u2010middle class, and of fresh produce retail. These unique factors have helped to propel it quickly.\nOriginality/value\nFor the first time in the literature, the paper presents an analysis of: the three waves in Indian retail; detailed sales data for all leading chains; and its uniqueness. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNote that that 5-6 percent estimate is lower than the share of all modern retail -which includes also the government and cooperative chains, which might make the share half or more again as much.4. Third surprise: private-retail revolution with unique Indian characteristics Various characteristics, especially of the second phase of the third wave -the private retail chain boom -are surprising, both to India, and about India compared with the past two decades of developing country modern retail diffusion. The essence of the differences is twofold. First, India has done what few other developing countries have done: started a supermarket revolution with domestic capital without relying at first on the push from retail FDI. Second, India has done what most other developing countries have done -but done them \"earlier\" (in the evolution of modern retail in the country), more simultaneously, more experimentally, more variously. We lay out the surprising differences below.\nPrimarily domestic investmentIt is common for domestic (family company) capital to be important in the earliest stages of supermarket development in developing countries, but for the \"take-off\" some sector well-endowed with capital steps in and drives the investment.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCheaper food could in turn help, as David Ricardo noted in the 1800s in Britain, to make non-food goods and services more competitive.Moreover, the most heated debate related to retail at this very moment (mid 2011) is whether multi-brand retail FDI should be liberalized. We do not take a side in this debate. We simply note what our findings suggest: whether or not retail FDI is liberalized, modern retail diffusion looks on the path to continue, even at its rapid pace of several times GDP growth, for some time. The \"drivers\" on the demand and investment supply side do not look to diminish. FDI liberalization may accelerate it, would probably (by definition) multinationalize it, may increase the overall level of retail \"development\" by bringing more international experience and technologies to bear; it would probably (as it has in China and elsewhere) create more \"procurement doors\" for two way flows of imports of products, and exports of Indian agricultural goods.Researchers focussed on food industry, agricultural economics, and agribusiness have a rich agenda before them to explore empirically, with rigorous surveys, the impacts on supply chains, and their actors of the emerging supermarket revolution in India.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSometimes that sector leads and then other sectors compete in investment and thus the aggregate investment grows. Those sectors can be: first, the government itself (the impetus for the initial expansion of the Chinese supermarket sector in the first half of the 1990s, followed then by vigorous FDI, with the two capital sources propelling the sector and 150 JADEE 1,2 leading to competitive investments by domestic private companies); second, foreign capital (important in the early stages of \"take off\" in much of Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe); third, much less common, domestic capital drawing from retained earnings in retail (such as large department store chains then starting supermarket chains), from investable funds retained from a broader conglomerate (such as one sees in Russia), or borrowing from banks (such as one saw in Chile).We will show that India has taken the Russian path in the private-chain boom. Phase 1 of Indian modern-private retail development fit mainly into the foreign capital-driven and the conglomerate and department store capital driven categories. Table I shows that Phase 2 is characterized mainly by a combination of the domestic sources.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We then discuss the energetics, structural evolution, and variations in electronic and mechanical properties of crystalline and amorphous Li\u2013M alloys. Our calculations show that Li insertion is the least favorable in Si and the most favorable in Sn owing to its large effective interstitial space and softer matrix. Upon Li incorporation, the bonding strength of the host network is weakened, attributed to the transferred charge from Li. Li interstitials can migrate easily in all three host materials with a moderate migration barrier in Si and small barriers in Ge and Sn. Because of the cation repulsive interaction, Li atoms tend to remain isolated and well dispersed in M; also induced by this cationic nature is the charge redistribution toward Li, leading to the strong screening/shielding effect in Si, in which the excess charges are highly localized, and a relatively weaker effect in Sn. According to our mixing enthalpy calculations, alloying between Li and M is energetically favorable with Li\u2013Sn alloys being the most stable, followed by Li\u2013Ge and Li\u2013Si alloys.

Although the most widely used graphite anodes in LIBs have good cycling performance with a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g \u00c01 (LiC 6 ), other group IV semiconductors (Si, Ge, Sn) can offer significantly higher capacities: 4200 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4.4 Si, 1600 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4. 4 Ge, and 990 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4.4 Sn.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe then discuss the energetics, structural evolution, and variations in electronic and mechanical properties of crystalline and amorphous Li\u00c0M alloys.

For instance, the diffusivity of Li in Ge is about 400 times greater than that of Li in Si at room temperature, 17 which may contribute to faster charge/discharge rates. Thus far, there has been no comprehensive comparison study on Si, Ge, and Sn as to the dynamic behavior of Li incorporation, the stability of the host lattices, and the properties of the alloys formed during lithiation.

Using Fe@SiO2 nanoellipsoids as anisotropic building blocks, herein we demonstrate a new class of magnetically responsive photonic structures whose photonic properties can be dynamically tuned by controlling the direction of the magnetic fields they are exposed to. These novel photonic structures diffract at a minimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle, and a maximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel direction; and the diffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is moved off-angle. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[1] Easily found in nature, such as opals,b ird feathers,a nd butterfly scales,s tructural color is brilliantly iridescent, metallic,a nd free from photobleaching unlike conventional pigments or dyes.Most colloidal assembly processes mimic the formation of opals and create close-packed structures from monodisperse colloidal spheres.H owever,l iving systems often involve non-closepacked ordered assemblies of anisotropic motifs,s uch as plates and rods,t hus display significantly more complex structural color responses including strong angular dependence and polarization effect. [2] Prior efforts have been made to organizing elongated particles,s uch as polystyrene and ZnS, [3] albeit the assembly methods are rather conventional and the resulting crystals do not exhibit different photonic responses to those from spherical particles.One of the important advantages of anisotropic particles is that they often have shape-dependent physical and chemical properties,which can add more degrees of freedom for manipulating the collective properties of the resultant superstructures.This is of particular interest to the fabrication of field-responsive colloidal photonic structures,i nw hich static or dynamic structural changes are usually accompanied by switching of photonic properties.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nU sing Fe@SiO 2 nanoellipsoids as anisotropic building blocks,h erein we demonstrate an ew class of magnetically responsive photonic structures whose photonic properties can be dynamically tuned by controlling the direction of the magnetic fields they are exposed to.T hese novel photonic structures diffract at am inimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle, and am aximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel direction;a nd the diffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is moved off-angle.Colloidal assembly has been widely explored to produce artificial structural color by manipulating the light interaction with physical periodic structures.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[4a] As expected, nanoellipsoids with higher aspect ratio,a si nt he case of NE-B than that of NE-A, lead to more changes in the interplanar spacing when the orientation of the assembled crystals are switched, resulting in abroader tuning range in photonic response.Theo rientational dependence of the nanoellipsoidal assemblies can find direct use in creating photonic patterns under magnetic fields with non-uniform field directions.A s demonstrated in Figure 3f,w hen subjected to complex magnetic field produced by an on-ideal linear Halbach array which has aspatially rotating pattern of magnetization, adispersion of NE-B encapsulated in aflat glass tube exhibits ar ainbow pattern containing blue,g reen, and red stripes.

These data indicate that chloride levels started rising in the mid-19th century and began accelerating in the early twentieth century. Lake Superior's and Lake Michigan's concentrations have continued to increase steadily and currently stand at their maximum recorded levels. In contrast, lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario reached peak levels between 1965 and 1975, but then began to decline. However, recent data indicate that the chloride concentrations in these lakes are now increasing again. Because loading data are not readily available, a mass-balance model is employed to estimate the chloride inputs required to account for the concentration trends. This inverse analysis yields computed load reductions that are consistent with reported industrial load reductions during the last three decades of the 20th century. Hence, it appears that the improvements were for the most part attributable to industrial controls. The model is also used to predict that if loads are held fixed at 2006 levels, concentrations in all lakes will continue to increase with the most dramatic rise occurring in Lake Michigan which will ultimately approach the level of Lake Erie. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBeyond its utility as an indicator, chloride can also have direct adverse impacts on lakes and other freshwater ecosystems. The Canadian federal government has recommended that road salt be added to the List of Toxic Substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act because of tangible threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2001). It has also been suggested that increases of chloride and other ions could be directly harmful to the Great Lakes ecosystem by fostering the spread of less-desirable halophilic organisms (Stoermer, 1978). More generally, trends of all major anions and cations are relevant as they contribute to aspects of lake chemistry such as ionic strength, pH and acid neutralizing capacity. Finally, at sufficiently high concentrations, chloride can influence density stratification as well as degrade the taste of drinking water.Two classic papers first established that Great Lakes chloride levels had increased significantly over the past century. In a perceptive and timely data analysis, Beeton (1965) documented substantial increases, starting as early as the late 19th century, in all the lakes with the exception of Lake Superior.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nChloride itself is not directly toxic, at least not at concentrations currently observed in the offshore regions of the Great Lakes. Other, indirect effects of chloride, such as changing the lake's chemical suitability for aquatic species, or impacting the mixing ability of the water column, may be influencing Great Lakes water quality.The modeling work presented here is significant in demonstrating the backdrop against which other, non-conservative substances, may be changing in the lakes. For example, the recent chloride increases in the upper lakes that are shown here are at least partially attributable to increased loadings that occurred in the past. The recent increases in the lower lakes are shown to be in part attributable to increased road salt usage in the watersheds and possibly also new or resuming industrial inputs.Beyond their water-quality implications, the chloride trends serve as \"canaries in the coal mine\" and show that, despite many improve-ments in Great Lakes water quality, human influences continue to impact offshore water quality. Furthermore, recent impacts may be as serious as past influences, and the sources may now be more diffuse and difficult to control. Consequently, vigilant stewardship based on continuous monitoring and scientific study must be vigorously supported in order to adequately protect this treasured system.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAlthough local increases may have occurred in the Great Lakes basin over this period, there is currently no direct evidence to confirm this hypothesis.The chloride concentration of untreated municipal wastewater ranges from about 20 to 160 mg/L (O' Connor and Mueller, 1970;Sonzogni et al., 1983;Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). In the 1970s, many wastewater treatment plants in the Great Lakes basin added ferric chloride to enhance phosphorus removal. As reported by Sonzogni et al. (1983), increases in chloride effluent concentration from these additions are on the order of 10 mg/L. Hence, the addition would not significantly increase normal effluent concentrations. Because sewage effluent is a relatively small component of the total chloride load, it is doubtful that the additional ferric chloride inputs could account for the recent increases.\nNew industrial sourcesThe second way in which loading might still be increasing would be if new industrial chloride discharges had begun entering the system since 1980. Because chloride loading is currently not being monitored, there is no available evidence pointing to significant new dischargers. The U.S.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFigure 2D shows that, on average, dynamic changes in tyrosine phosphorylation occur much faster and from a lower basal level compared to serine/ threonine phosphorylation.We found phosphorylation sites on a wide variety of proteins, and about half the proteins contained more than one site (Table S2). Figure 2E shows a Gene Ontology (GO) (Zeeberg et al., 2003) analysis of the in vivo phosphoproteome. GO localization information existed for 1,589 of the 2,244 phosphoproteins. Almost half of the phosphorylation events occurred on nuclear proteins, whereas only one-third of all proteins in the database were assigned as nuclear by GO, indicating that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins. The proportion of regulated proteins closely paralleled the total number of phosphorylations of nuclear proteins. As expected, proteins annotated as extracellular were significantly underrepresented in the phosphoproteome. Although there is evidence of a mitochondrial phosphoproteome (Pagliarini and Dixon, 2006), proteins annotated as mitochondrial by GO were underrepresented, as were plasma membrane proteins.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs membrane proteins are often of low abundance and we did not specifically enrich the plasma membrane in this analysis, we are less likely to identify phosphorylation events associated with them. Conversely, proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, which are generally of higher abundance, were almost twice as likely to be detected in the phosphoproteome as compared with their proportion in the database, and they accounted for an even higher share of the regulated sites. This illustrates that, at the current state of technology, our phosphopeptide screen is still not comprehensive. We may also miss certain phosphopeptides that are either too small or too large in mass to be readily measurable in our current MS setup. Therefore, absence of a phosphorylation site from our data set does not necessarily mean that it does not exist.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs in the case of SwissProt, close to 90% of our data are novel compared with these previous studies. Taken together, our data suggest that, despite several decades of research into phosphorylation, most in vivo phosphorylation sites have still not been detected.\nPhosphoproteome DynamicsEGF signaling begins with activation of the EGF receptor and extends through a cascade of downstream kinases to mediate the increased phosphorylation of a large number of substrate proteins. The overall levels of phosphorylated proteins within a specific cellular compartment are also affected by other processes, including dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, protein degradation via ubiquitination, and translocation of the protein to another subcellular location. Our experiment measures the net effect of all these diverse processes that collectively regulate the dynamic phosphoproteome.To search for patterns in the time profiles of the regulated phosphopeptides, we explored several clustering techniques. Clustering algorithms have been applied extensively to the analysis of gene-expression data, including time-series data sets.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Ten specimens representing different joints were used and five criteria of osteoarthritis were scored. Eleven of the 38 participants ranked themselves as beginners, 13 as experienced and six as very experienced; the data were subsequently examined using the results from these 30, comparing beginners with experts.

There was little difference between beginners and experts.\nAlthough all the specimens were chosen to meet our published criteria for osteoarthritis, the experts were unanimous is agreeing the diagnosis in only three cases and the beginners in only one.\nThese results suggest that more work needs to be done to develop operational definitions for the classification of disease in palaeopathology and that great care must be taken when comparing disease frequencies between studies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe inferior facet joint (shown in Figure 1) had very obvious eburnation and scoring on the joint surface and could not possibly have been mistaken for anything other than osteoarthritis; the fact that so many people did misdiagnose it suggests that they were actually scoring the normal, superior facet joint; this, at least, is our most charitable explanation.In general, there was better agreement about the diagnosis when eburnation was present, although three of the experts and two of the beginners did not diagnose specimen 10 as having osteoarthritis even though there was an obvious area of eburnation on the inferior surface of the head of this metatarsal.O n e practical outcome of this study must be that greater efforts will need to be taken to agree on the criteria >for the classification of pathological changes in palaeopathology. What is required for palaeopathological work is the development of operational definitions, since it is not valid entirely t o rely on either clinical or radiological diagnoses. For example, we have shown that radiology is not reliable in detecting changes that are evident to the palaeopathologist.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFigure 1 .1Figure 1.

What has emerged from the study is that more than half the observers.

Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAlthough no polyhedral analysis was carried out, the usefulness of these inequalities has been demonstrated through computational experiments. A comparison with version 8.1 of CPLEX shows that the branch-and-cut algorithm proposed here reduces both the CPU time and the number of nodes explored in the branch-and-bound tree. The methodology proposed in this paper obviously cannot be used to solve large-scale instances containing hundreds or thousands of users as it is sometimes the case in large cities. It is, however, fast enough to be used as a post-processor to optimize individual routes or small subsets of routes produced by a meta-heuristic. In the presence of ride time constraints, using dynamic programming would be difficult since the states of the dynamic programming algorithm would have to take into account the individual ride time of each user. Future work will concentrate on the development of more refined separation procedures for the various types of inequalities introduced in this paper.for U 1 must visit node n + i 2 before visiting node i 1 .

Based on a combination of molecular characteristics typical of many Precambrian bitumens, their consistently and unusually high thermal maturities, and their widespread distribution throughout the Hamersley Basin, the bitumens can be characterized as \u2018probably of Archean age\u2019. Accepting this interpretation, the biomarkers open a new window on Archean biodiversity. The presence of hopanes in the Archean rocks confirms the antiquity of the domain Bacteria, and high relative concentrations of 2\u03b1-methylhopanes indicate that cyanobacteria were important primary producers. Oxygenic photosynthesis therefore evolved > 2.7 Ga ago, and well before independent evidence suggests significant levels of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. Moreover, the abundance of cyanobacterial biomarkers in shales interbedded with oxide-facies banded iron formations (BIF) indicates that although some Archean BIF might have been formed by abiotic photochemical processes or anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, those in the Hamersley Group formed as a direct consequence of biological oxygen production. Biomarkers of the 3\u03b2-methylhopane series suggest that microaerophilic heterotrophic bacteria, probably methanotrophs or methylotrophs, were active in late Archean environments. The presence of steranes in a wide range of structures with relative abundances like those from late Paleoproterozoic to Phanerozoic sediments is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean, 900 Ma before visible fossil evidence indicates that the lineage arose. Sterol biosynthesis in extant eukaryotes requires molecular oxygen. The presence of steranes together with biomarkers of oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria suggests that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in some regions of the upper water column was equivalent to at least \u223c1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) and may have been sufficient to support aerobic respiration. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs fossil dinoflagellates (and diatoms) first appear in the Mesozoic, dinosteranes discovered in Paleozoic and Proterozoic sedimentary rocks were described as products of ancestral dinoflagellates (protodinoflagellates) (Moldowan et al., 1996). However, dinosteranes of Archean age have more likely a biologically independent origin, as ancestral dinoflagellates and diatoms almost certainly appeared much later in Earth history.So, the wide structural range of steranes in the Archean bitumens in relative proportion similar to those of many younger bitumens is evidence for the presence of eukaryotes in the late Archean. But the phylogenetic status of the sterol producers within the domain Eucarya in the late Archean remains to be resolved.\nLow Levels of Change Through 3 Ga of Lipid BiosynthesisA striking feature of the 2.7-Ga-old Archean bitumens is their similarity to other Precambrian, but also Phanerozoic samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDinosteranes are abundant biomarkers in almost all Mesozoic and Cenozoic bitumens (Moldowan et al., 1996) but have also been detected in the Paleozoic and Proterozoic, albeit in lower concentrations (Moldowan et al., 1996). So far, the oldest known dinosteranes come from the \u03f31.1-Ga Nonesuch Shale, Michigan (Summons and Walter, 1990). The biologic precursor of dinosteranes is dinosterol that is commonly regarded as diagnostic for dinoflagellates (Robinson et al., 1984;Summons et al., 1987Summons et al., , 1992;;Moldowan et al., 1996;Moldowan and Talyzina, 1998), although it has also been recorded in one diatom species as a minor component (Volkman et al., 1993).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHigher concentrations of sterols with the 4-methylcholestane (C 28 ), 4-methyl-24-methylcholestane (C 29 ) and 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestane (C 30 ) skeletons are present in most dinoflagellates (Robinson et al., 1984) and less commonly in diatoms (Nichols et al., 1990). Sterols with the 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestane skeleton (C 30 ) have also been isolated from prymnesiophyte algae of the order Pavlovales (Volkman et al., 1990), and with the 4-methylcholestane skeleton (C 28 ) from the methylotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus (Bird et al., 1971). Regular 4-methylsteranes are therefore not sufficiently taxon-specific to interpret their occurrence in Archean bitumen below domain level.4\u2423,23,24-Trimethylcholestanes (dinosteranes) also occur in trace amounts in the Archean bitumens (Brocks et al., 2003).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here it is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that proper intensification of ionized impurity scattering to charge carriers can benefit the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) by increasing the Seebeck coefficient and decreasing the electronic thermal conductivity. The optimal strength of ionized impurity scattering for maximum ZT depends on the Fermi level and the density of states effective mass. Cr\u2010doping in CeyCo4Sb12 progressively increases the strength of ionized impurity scattering, and significantly improves the Seebeck coefficient, resulting in high power factors of 45 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 with relatively low electrical conductivity. This effect, combined with the increased Ce\u2010filling fraction and thus decreased lattice thermal conductivity by charge compensation of Cr\u2010dopant, gives rise to a maximum ZT of 1.3 at 800 K and a large average ZT of 1.1 between 500 and 850 K, \u224830% and \u224820% enhancements as compared with those of Cr\u2010free sample, respectively. Furthermore, this study also reveals that carrier scattering parameter can be another fundamental degree of freedom to optimize electrical properties and improve thermal\u2010to\u2010electricity conversion efficiencies of thermoelectric materials. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 21 ] The carrier scattering probability by ionized impurity is inversely proportional to \u03b5 3/2 ( \u03b5 : carrier energy) or v 3 ( v : drift velocity), [ 22,23 ] therefore the low energy carriers would experience more scattering and be fi ltered out by the charged impurities. This energy fi ltering effect could enhance the Seebeck coeffi cient, analogous to the effect of energy barriers. [ 3,15 ] Theoretically this offers the possibility to optimize PF through balancing the mobility decrease and the Seebeck coeffi cient enhancement, and the optimal scattering parameter should depend on the Fermi level and other material-specifi c para meters. [ 14,18,24 ] This effect is analogue to the prediction by Ioffe [ 25 ] about a half century ago, however, rather precise control of the impurity scattering strength is required to realize power factor and ZT improvements in heavily doped semiconductors.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[ 10 ] Strategies such as carrier concentration engineering [ 2,11 ] and band structure modifi cation [ 12 ] have been identifi ed to be effective for PF and ZT enhancements.Besides being pertinent to the electronic band structure and the Fermi level, electrical transport properties are also closely related to the carrier scattering processes, including phonon scattering, impurity scattering, energy barrier scattering, etc. [13][14][15] Above room temperature, lattice vibrations generally dominate the carrier scattering for most of the thermoelectric materials, e.g., Bi 2 Te 3 [ 16 ] or PbTe. [ 17 ] Since almost all of the thermoelectric materials are heavily doped semiconductors, impurity scattering, especially ionized impurity scattering, could play an important role in carrier transport at T > 300 K, as evident in Ni-doped [ 18,19 ] or Te-doped [ 20 ] CoSb 3 , or transition metalsubstituted clathrates.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis result agrees well with the predictions of Ioffe [ 25 ] and Ure. [ 24 ] The increase in the Seebeck coeffi cient, due to the fi ltering of low-energy electrons by ionized impurity scattering, compensates or even overcompensates the reduction of mobility, giving rise to the power factor enhancement. This effect is in principle analogues to the fi ltering effect created by energy barriers. [ 3 ] Particularly, thermal conductivity can also be lowered due to the reduced electronic contribution and the intensifi ed phonon point defect scattering, and thus a large enhancement in ZT can be expected. The comparisons between the experimental data and the numerical calculations (solid lines) are shown in Figure 3 b-d. These calculations without any adjustable parameter show good agreement with the experimental results, especially for the Seebeck coeffi cient and the electrical conductivity.The discrepancies are mainly attributed to the variation of the Fermi level, as indicated in Table 1 . This further verifi es the rationality of the present simple model. The fi ts between calculated and experimental power factors are less satisfactory, mainly due to the variation of \u03b7 and large uncertainty of PF (\u224810%).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It is an integral (Fock) operator for hybrids but a differential operator [citation 31] for meta-GGAs, the same operator for occupied and unoccupied one-electron states.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: More realistic band gaps from meta-generalized gradient approximations: Only in a generalized Kohn-Sham scheme \nAbstract: Unlike the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), calculations with meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGA) are usually done according to the generalized Kohn-Sham (gKS) formalism. The exchange-correlation potential of the gKS equation is nonmultiplicative, which prevents systematic comparison of meta-GGA band structures to those of the LDA and the GGA. We implement the optimized effective potential (OEP) of the meta-GGA for periodic systems, which allows us to carry out meta-GGA calculations in the same KS manner as for the LDA and the GGA. We apply the OEP to several meta-GGAs, including the new SCAN functional [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)]. We find that the KS gaps and KS band structures of meta-GGAs are close to those of GGAs. They are smaller than the more realistic gKS gaps of meta-GGAs, but probably close to the less-realistic gaps in the band structure of the exact KS potential, as can be seen by comparing with the gaps of the EXX+ RPA OEP potential. The well-known grid sensitivity of meta-GGAs is much more severe in OEP calculations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(4)Eq.

The gKS meta-GGA band gap of periodic systems improves 11 over the KS GGA gaps as expected. In this work we find that, with the recently proposed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional 12,13 , the gKS meta-GGA gap corrects about 20%\u223c50% of the difference between the experimental fundamental gap and the GGA KS gap.Due to the restriction in the functional form of GGA, a GGA cannot perform well for finite systems and periodic systems at the same time. 14 On the other hand, the functional form of meta-GGA can satisfy more exact conditions and has a wider range of applicability than the GGA form. The SCAN functional is a non-empirical functional that satisfies all known exact constraints appropriate to a semilocal functional, and is expected to perform well for systems with very different kinds of bonds.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe computational accuracies of the SCAN functional for many properties improve over those of the GGAs, with only marginal increase of computational cost. 12 We find that SCAN also improves band gaps, but the comparsion is between meta-GGA gKS gaps and GGA KS gaps, which are not the same quantity. It is unclear whether the KS gap itself is improved, or just the gKS gap is improved. One needs to do meta-GGA calculations in the KS scheme to be able to have a systematic comparsion of the KS band gaps between meta-GGA and GGA.In the gKS formalism for an orbital functional such as a meta-GGA or hybrid functional, we find the \"optimal variational potential\", a non-multiplicative self-adjoint operator that minimizes the energy functional with respect to the orbitals. This potential is a differential operator for a meta-GGA and an integral operator for a hybrid functional. In the KS formalism for an orbital functional, we find the optimized effective potential (OEP) 15,16 , the multiplicative xc potential that minimizes the energy.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The aim of our study was to assess the functional state of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling in patients with MS. Tr1 cells were induced in vitro by activation with anti-CD46 antibodies in controls and patients with MS. Cells were phenotyped by cytometry and suppression assays, and the expression of cytokines and transcription factors was evaluated by real-time PCR, ELISA, cytometry and Western blotting. We found that the activity of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling is impaired in MS patients since Tr1 cells isolated from MS patients produced less IL-10 than those obtained from controls. Indeed, the supernatants from Tr1 cells from controls did not suppress the proliferation of stimulated CD4(+) cells from patients with MS. Furthermore, the IL-10R signaling pathway was not fully active in CD4(+) cells from MS patients and these cells had higher baseline levels of SOCS3 transcripts than controls. Indeed, after in vitro IL-10 stimulation, the expression levels of the STAT1, STAT3 and IL-10RA genes were higher in MS patients than in controls. Moreover, Stat-3 phosphorylation was lower in controls than in patients after IL-10 stimulation. These results indicate that IL-10 regulatory function is impaired in patients with MS. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1D) and they also augmented the levels of both intracellular (Fig. 1D) and secreted IL-10 protein (Fig. 1E; p <0.05 in all cases). Finally, we assessed whether Tr1 cells acted as regulatory Tcells, by assessing the capacity of the secreted cytokines (mainly IL-10) to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. We found that the supernatants from Tr1 cell cultures, containing high levels of IL-10 (in the range of 5580-7533 pg/mL), as well as recombinant IL-10, were able to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + Tcells (Fig. 1F; p <0.001). This suppression was impaired in the presence of the anti-IL-10 antibody, confirming that the suppression was mediated by IL-10 (Fig. 1F).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[21] demonstrated that Tr1 function is also impaired in patients with MS. Moreover, the expression of the immunosuppressor cytokine IL-10 is diminished in MS patients [22,23], in accordance with previous studies describing fewer IL-10-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Interestingly, there is a reduction in the expression of IL-10 but elevated numbers of PBMC expressing IL-10 transcripts before clinical relapse in MS [24], and there is a correlation between IL-10 levels and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients [25]. Engineered Th2/Tr1 cells that produce high levels of IL-10 prevent epitope spreading and ameliorate the disease course in animal models of MS [26]. However, it is unknown whether the functional activity of IL-10 in MS is preserved, and attempts to treat MS patients with IL-10 have not been successful to date.In order to explore the functionality of Tr1 regulatory function in MS, we assessed the ex vivo induction of the Tr1 phenotype and the response of CD4 + cells to the IL-10 produced by these cells in patients with MS.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIndeed, stimulation of CD4 + cells increased the expression of IL-10 and IFN-c RNA (p <0.05 in both cases) but not that of IL-2 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we assessed whether such CD4 + Tcell cultures remain stable over time and whether Tr1 cells released large amounts of IL-10 upon further stimulation. The same CD46-induced Tr1 induction protocol was applied to cells from five healthy control (HC) individuals and a second stimulation was applied 10 days later with an anti-CD3 rather than the anti-CD46 antibody. When the Tr1 phenotype was assessed at different intervals, we found that after the first stimulation the majority of the cells had developed an activation and memory phenotype. Moreover, they increased the release of IL-10, the production of which peaked at day 3 and decreased over the following 10 days. Over the next 7 days, the Tr1 cells maintained the activation and memory phenotype, but they produced less IL-10. After a second stimulation 10 days later, the majority of the cells showed a CD25 + CD45RO + activation/memory phenotype (65%; Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-I) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered IFN-\u03b2 are partly mediated by AhR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AhR agonists that act on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AhR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDepending on the experimental model, pro-and anti-inflammatory effects of the commensal flora have been recently reported 57,58,14,15,59 highlighting the need to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the commensal flora regulates the immune response. In this context, our work contributes to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of AhR agonists generated from dietary Trp by TnAse dependent and independent pathways in commensal bacteria 44 . Moreover, our results identify a molecular pathway through which the diet in cooperation with the commensal flora modulate the activity of CNS resident cells and neuroinflammation. In addition, the regulation of AhR expression by IFN-\u03b2 suggest that the microbiome may affect not only the development of CNS autoimmunity, but also its response to disease modifying therapies 60 . Thus, the study of the metabolic and environmental factors that regulate astrocyte activity may shed light on CNS physiology, identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and drive the development of more efficacious therapeutic interventions for MS and other neurologic diseases.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAstrocytes also play important roles during CNS injury and disease, and are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [10][11][12] . Astrocyte activity is affected by factors produced within and outside the CNS, therefore, the study of these factors may shed light on the regulation of astrocyte function in health and disease and identify new therapeutic approaches for human neurologic disorders.The microbial flora and its products have been shown to control T cell-dependent inflammation through several mechanisms including the conversion of precursors provided by the diet into immune regulatory metabolites [13][14][15] . However, less is known about the effects of the diet and microbial products on the inflammatory response of resident cells in the CNS. Here we identify an IFN-I and AhR axis that integrates immunologic, metabolic and environmental cues to regulate astrocyte activity and CNS inflammation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase.

These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.Astrocytes are the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system (CNS). They participate in diverse functions including control of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the regulation of metabolism, the modulation of neuronal transmission and CNS development and repair [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Experimental immunization with sporozoites induces this type of protective response, but the extremely large number of proteins expressed by Plasmodium parasites has so far prohibited the identification of sufficient discrete T-cell antigens to develop subunit vaccines that produce sterile immunity. Here, using mice singly immunized with Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites and high-throughput screening, we identified a unique CTL response against the parasite ribosomal L3 protein. Unlike CTL responses to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the population of L3-specific CTLs was not expanded by multiple sporozoite immunizations. CSP is abundant in the sporozoite itself, whereas L3 expression does not increase until the liver stage. The response induced by a single immunization with sporozoites reduces the parasite load in the liver so greatly during subsequent immunizations that L3-specific responses are only generated during the primary exposure. Functional L3-specific CTLs can, however, be expanded by heterologous prime-boost regimens. Thus, although repeat sporozoite immunization expands responses to preformed antigens like CSP that are present in the sporozoite itself, this immunization strategy may not expand CTLs targeting parasite proteins that are synthesized later. Heterologous strategies may be needed to increase CTL responses across the entire spectrum of Plasmodium liver-stage proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe lack of L3 boosting by repeated sporozoite exposures may be emblematic of a phenomenon affecting other liver-stage parasite antigens as well. Heterologous prime-boost approaches are being used for malaria vaccination-challenge studies in mice and humans (49). Our findings make the case for heterologous approaches at the antigen discovery phase as well. By inducing a broad immune repertoire, we may be able to generate responses capable of eradicating all malariainfected hepatocytes, including those missed by CSP-or other sporozoite-limited responses.\nMaterials and MethodsReagents.

Thus, in contrast to multiple sporozoite immunizations, a heterologous prime-boost approach expanded the L3-specific population and maintained its activated phenotype.\nPrior Sporozoite Immunization Eliminates L3 Expression and Liver Stage Parasite Development and Prevents the Boosting of Responses AgainstLate Liver Stage Antigens. Heterologous prime-boost studies presented above suggested that functional memory L3 CTLs were formed by priming with sporozoites. To explain the lack of L3 CTL boosting in response to subsequent sporozoite immunizations, we hypothesized that L3 antigen was insufficiently presented during secondary or later sporozoite immunizations because the developing adaptive immune response constrained the parasite such that L3 expression was suppressed during later immunizations. To test this hypothesis, we immunized mice one to three times with 2 \u00d7 10 4 P. yoelii GAP at 1-or 3-wk intervals. Unimmunized mice and mice 44 h after the last immunization were killed and total RNA was extracted from livers to evaluate parasite abundance and transcript expression.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nL3-specific killing in mice primed with L3 peptide-pulsed DCs was boosted by a secondary sporozoite immunization (Fig. 4E). In all of these studies, CSP-specific responses could be potently triggered by any combination of DC and/or sporozoite immunizations.To test whether heterologous prime-boost immunization could overcome the poor L3 response in sporozoite immunized mice, we primed mice with L3 peptide-pulsed DCs or GAP sporozoites and boosted with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) expressing the L3 epitope (Lm-L3). Similar to the behavior of CSP-specific cells following multiple sporozoite immunizations, these heterologous prime-boost approaches expanded the population of activated (CD11a HI CD62L LO CD44 HI ) L3-specific T cells by 0.74 or 1.67 log 10 cells per spleen for L3 peptide-pulsed DC or GAP priming, respectively, compared with the appropriately matched Lm-L3 priming immunization alone (Fig. 4 F and G).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy study of gate-tunable tBLG devices supported by atomically smooth and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (BN). The high quality of these tBLG devices allows identification of coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns and moir\u00e9 super-superlattices produced by graphene-graphene and graphene-BN interlayer interactions. Furthermore, we examine additional tBLG spectroscopic features in the local density of states beyond the first van Hove singularity. Our experimental data are explained by a theory of moir\u00e9 bands that incorporates ab initio calculations and confirms the strongly nonperturbative character of tBLG interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBy comparing the moir\u00e9 wavelength dependence of this new feature's energy to calculations incorporating ab initio results, we find that it arises from a partial gap opening between the second and third moir\u00e9 bands due to strong non-perturbative interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. These measurements on our high quality tBLG/BN samples provide a first look into the atomic-scale behavior of electrostatically gated tBLG, an important device configuration for future applications [28,29].Our measurements were performed using an Omicron ultra-high vacuum (UHV) STM operating at temperature T = 5 K with electrochemically etched PtIr tips. The tips were calibrated against the surface state of an Au(111) crystal before performing all measurements [30]. Differential conductance (dI/dV) was measured by lock-in detection of the a.c. tunnel current modulated by a 6-8 meV (rms), 400-700 Hz signal added to the sample bias (V s ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese resultsshow that the strong coupling, low twist-angle regime in tBLG can be accessed using scanned probe techniques via high quality devices that allow electrostatic Fermi level tuning.

The presence of these moir\u00e9 patterns indicates that the interfaces between the graphene and BN layers are atomically sharp and free from contamination. The origins of the different moir\u00e9 patterns are easily distinguished since the depressions in the graphene-graphene moir\u00e9 pattern form a honeycomb-like appearance, whereas the depressions in the graphene-BN moir\u00e9 pattern resemble a triangular lattice.

The results have important implications for understanding water adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces and the penetration of water into hydrophobic phases.Protein folding, membrane formation, micellar assembly, and wetting are a few of the many processes in which the interaction of water with hydrophobic fluid surfaces plays an important role. A driving force behind these processes is an uncommonly large entropy loss, which is usually explained as an enhanced structuring of water in the immediate vicinity of apolar molecules, biological macromolecules, and hydrophobic surfaces. Experimental measurements that provide a molecular-level view of interfacial water structure and hydrogen bonding at these interfaces have proven to be problematic because of the difficulty in selectively examining interfacial water molecules. Hence, most of our understanding of the molecular structure of water at hydrophobic surfaces comes from theory (1-7).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nRecent molecular dynamics simulations (30) of this interface are consistent with our observations. The combined areas under the peaks corresponding to these oriented and weakly bonded water molecules [that is, those that straddle the interface (nos. 4 and 2) and in-terfacial water monomers/HB acceptors (no.3)] make the most substantial contribution to the VSF spectrum and consequently represent the majority of the water molecules in the interfacial region. Although quantitative comparison of peak areas is complicated by the fact that increased hydrogen bonding results in stronger OH stretch intensity (17), such trends would support an even stronger dominance in the proportion of weakly interacting interfacial water molecules at these organic/water interfaces. The spectra do not provide support for commonly accepted models of an increase in the coordination number of water molecules at an organic/water interface and/or a strengthening of the hydrogenbonding network between water molecules, both which would appear as a growth in intensity at lower frequencies rather than as an observed reduction in intensity in this region.These studies demonstrate that dipolar interactions between interfacial water molecules and the polarizable organic phase play an important role in the interfacial region, resulting in strong orientation effects.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3%) of 1,505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBackgroundZIKAV, an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus [5], was first isolated in 1947 from a monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda [6]. Sporadic human Zika fever cases have been reported since the 1960s [7]. The first documented outbreak outside Africa and Asia occurred in 2007 in the Yap State, Micronesia, in the North Pacific, where Zika fever was characterised by rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia [8].ZIKAV has been isolated from several Aedes mosquito species, notably including Ae. aegypti [9] and Ae. albopictus [10]. Ae. aegypti is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and Ae. albopictus is now established in many parts of Europe, especially Mediterranean countries [11]. Recent reports of imported cases of ZIKAV infection from south-east Asia or the Pacific to Europe [12] or Japan [13] highlight the risk of ZIKAV emergence in parts of the world where the vector is present.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections. Arbovirus transfusionderived transmission has been reported principally for WNV [19], DENV [20] and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [21,22]. For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high [21,22].During the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007) [21] and in R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-07) [22], blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia.Due to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR [16]. The protocol was implemented in November 2013, when agreement from the French Polynesian health authorities was obtained.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDetection of Zika virus in cultureSera from 34 ZIKAV RT-PCR-positive donors were inoculated on Vero cells in order to detect replicative viral particles; there was insufficient serum available for the remaining eight RT-PCR-positive donors. Of the 34 inoculated, three were positive in culture. However, the culture was conducted retrospectively and sample storage conditions were not optimal for viral culture (several freeze /thaw cycles), leading potentially to some false-negative results.\nOccurrence of Zika fever-like syndrome following blood donationBlood donors positive for ZIKAV were contacted retrospectively by telephone to investigate the occurrence of 'Zika fever-like syndrome' (rash and /or conjunctivitis and/or arthralgia) after their blood donation. Of the 42 donors tested positive by RT-PCR, 11 declared that they had a Zika fever -like syndrome from 3 to 10 days after they gave blood.\nDiscussionThe main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75% for DENV [17] and West Nile virus (WNV) [18].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

How caspase-11 executes these downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 maturation. A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, Gsdmd(-/-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Gram-negative bacteria. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOur data reveal that proteolytic cleavage of Gsdmd by mouse caspase-11 or human caspase-4 is essential for pyroptosis of innate immune cells and endothelial cells harbouring LPS-tainted cytoplasm. Cleaved Gsdmd also triggers NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 through a cell-intrinsic pathway (Fig. 4c), although the exact mechanism responsible for NLRP3 activation remains unclear. NLRP3 senses diverse stimuli that perturb intracellular homeostasis 6, 19,21,22 , so its activation may be an indirect consequence of the effects of the Gsdmd p30 fragment. Future studies will need to address exactly what the p30 fragment does in cells. The redefined non-canonical inflammasome signalling pathway (Fig. 4c) refutes the previous hypothesis that a caspase-1/11 complex is responsible for caspase-1 activation 1, 36 .The partial contribution of Gsdmd to caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis suggests the existence of other pro-pyroptotic caspase-1 substrates (Fig. 5d).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nLoss of NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1 in BMDMs did not markedly affect caspase-11-dependent generation of mature Gsdmd p30 in response to cytoplasmic LPS (Fig. 4a), indicating that Gsdmd cleavage occurs upstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The question arises as to whether Gsdmd induces pyroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation simultaneously in the same cell, or if Gsdmd-mediated pyroptosis releases damage-associated molecular patterns 29 that trigger caspase-11-independent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neighbouring cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We believe the latter hypothesis is unlikely because LPS-stimulated Il1b 2/2 BMDMs exhibited normal pyroptosis, yet their culture supernatant failed to induce IL-1b secretion from Casp11 2/2 BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2b) without affecting Gsdmd cleavage (Extended Data Fig. 4b). These data confirm that conversion of pro-Gsdmd to its mature p30 form by caspase-11 is essential for both pyroptosis and caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic LPS. Cytoplasmic LPS also caused caspase-4-dependent processing of GSDMD in human THP-1 monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Furthermore, transient overexpression of caspase-4 or caspase-5 caused human GSDMD cleavage to the pro-pyroptotic p30 fragment (Extended Data Fig. 5b andc). These data together with the conserved P 1 and P 1 9 residues in GSDMD (Extended Data Fig. 4a) indicate a conserved mechanism of GSDMD activation by caspase-4/5/11.Cytoplasmic LPS induces caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and secretion of IL-1b, but only the latter requires caspase-1, NLRP3 and ASC 1,7 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We investigated the actions of Nec-1 and its so-called inactive analog, Nec-1i, in the setting of myocardial I/R injury.\nMaterials and methods: The actions of Nec-1 and Nec-1i were examined in cultured C2C12 and H9c2 myocytes, cardiomyocytes isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats, Langendorff isolated perfused C57Bl/6J mouse hearts and an in vivo open-chest C57Bl/6J mouse heart model.\nResults: Nec-1 at 30 microM and 100 microM (but not 100 microM Nec-1i) reduced peroxide-induced cell death in C2C12 cells from 51.2 +/- 1.1% (control) to 26.3 +/- 2.9% (p < 0.01 vs control) and 17.8 +/- 0.9% (p < 0.001), respectively. With H9c2 cells cell death was also reduced from 73.0 +/- 0.4% (control) to 56.7 +/- 0% (30 microM Nec-1, p < 0.05) and 45.4 +/- 3.3% (100 microM Nec-1, p < 0.01). In the isolated perfused heart Nec-1 (30 microM) reduced infarct size (calculated as a percentage of the risk area) from 48.0 +/- 2.0% (control) to 32.1 +/- 5.4% (p < 0.05). Nec-1i (30 microM) also reduced infarct size (32.9 +/- 5.1%, p < 0.05). In anesthetized C57Bl/6J mice Nec-1 (1.65 mg/kg), given intraperitoneally to coincide with reperfusion following left anterior descending artery ligation (30 min), also reduced infarct size from 45.3 +/- 5.1% (control) to 26.6 +/- 4.0% (p < 0.05), whilst Nec-1i (1.74 mg/kg) was ineffective (37.8 +/- 6.0%). Stimulus-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in rat cardiomyocytes, as reflected by the time until mitochondrial depolarisation, was unaffected by Nec-1 or Nec-1i at 30 muM but increased at 100 muM i.e. 91% (p < 0.05 vs control) and 152% (p < 0.001) for Nec-1 and Nec-1i, respectively.\nConclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that necrostatins inhibit myocardial cell death and reduce infarct size, possibly via a mechanism independent of the MPTP. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMore recently sitosterol-induced death in macrophages was reported to be caspaseindependent and blocked by Nec-1, and again it was suggested that necroptosis (and autophagy) might be involved [13], although considerably more work will be required before necroptosis can be unequivocally confirmed as representing a distinct entity.Protection against I/R injury in the heart and the brain could involve similar mechanisms and this could extend to the particular cell-signaling pathways or enzymes that are activated or down-regulated during the recovery process [14]. As Nec-1 has been shown to limit cellular damage in the brain we decided to ascertain whether it could produce a similar action in the myocardium. To investigate this we used a variety of in vitro experimental models.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe advent of newer and possibly more potent forms of the necrostatins will also assist in this process [22].In conclusion, as discussed by Degterev et al. [12] necrosis and apoptosis play key roles in a variety of pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction, and the identification of compounds such as the necrostatins which may target the proposed alternative death pathway, necroptosis, may lead to the development of more effective therapies. Our data are the first to indicate that necrostatin is protective against I/R injury in the myocardium, possibly via mechanisms other than those that are generally accepted as being involved (i.e. apoptosis and necrosis) [23]. It should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs delaying MPTP opening is believed to represent a key factor with respect to cardioprotection and may be linked to apoptosis, our failure to show a delay with lower Nec-1 concentrations may be consistent with the findings of Degterev and colleagues [12], who claimed that the effects produced by Nec-1 are mediated by a mechanism distinct from necrosis and apoptosis, namely necroptosis. As suggested by Formigli et al. [20] for a process they termed aponecrosis and claimed shared characteristics with apoptosis and necrosis, necroptosis could represent one of a continuum of death processes with apoptosis and necrosis occurring at its two extremes [20]. Clearly, however, before any firm conclusions can be made regarding necroptosis and the mode(s) of action of necrostatins in the context of myocardial infarction more detailed studies, possibly involving the use of Nec-1 in combination with caspase inhibitors (inhibitors which block apoptotic pathways), should be carried out [21]. An examination of the effects of necrostatins on cell signaling pathways involved in cardioprotection will aid in the characterisation of these agents [4].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Evidence was obtained for different sites of binding of different antibodies and direct correspondence was observed between these sites and the locations of antigenic sites A, B, and E defined by determining the amino acids recognized by the specific antibodies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDISCUSSIONThese results directly demonstrate the sites of binding of four monoclonal antibodies of different specificities to the X-31 BHA. That the sites are different in detail for the different antibodies may be deduced from the observations that the angles formed between Fab regions and the BHA are constant and different for each antibody. The observation that these angles are constant irrespective of the type of complex observed, 1 + 1, 1 + 2,2 + 2, RHAantibody, etc., is allowed by the axial-rotation and flexing properties of the switch and hinge regions of the antibody molecules (Wrigley et ab, 1983).Differences in the sites of antibody binding on the BHA can also be observed directly even at this level of resolution (probably about 2 nm). For example HC45 clearly binds at a site away from an end of the BHA molecule whereas HC31 binds squarely on an end. This location of the HC31 antibody-binding site is supported by the observation of restricted complex formation. Only 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 BHAantibody complexes were seen (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe amino acids recognized have generally been assumed to contribute to the particular antibody binding site. We present here evidence obtained directly by electron microscopy of haemagglutinin-antibody complexes that this is the case for ant.i-\nMETHODS\nHaemagglutininpreparation Soluble preparations of the haemagglutinin (BHA) from X-31 (H3N2) (Kilbourne, 1969) were made by bromelain digestion of purified virus particles as described by Brand and Skehel (1972).Monoclonal antibody preparation. Balb/ c mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of 8000 HA units of purified virus. Eight weeks later they received 32,000 BHA units of virus intraperitoneally and intravenously. Three days later their spleens were removed and the cells fused with SP2/ 0-Ag14 myeloma cells (Shulman et d, 1978) as described by Kohler andMilstein (1975, 1976). Hybrid cell culture conditions were based on those described by Fazekas de St. Groth and Scheidegger (1980).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3) presumably because of the binding of a second antibody to an unoccupied equivalent region of the BHA trimer is sterically prevented by the first antibody bound.The sites of antibody binding and the locations of amino acid substitutions in the BIIAs of antigenie variants can also be considered in relation to the thxee-dimensional structure of the BHA, Fig. 6. These considerations indicate that the sites of amino acid substitution are in all four cases appropriately located to be involved directly in the antibody-binding sites. In the case of HC31 they also indicate the basis of the steric inhibition of the binding of a second antibody to the BHA. Since the three 198 residues recognized are only 15 A apart around the threefold axis of the trimer, the BHA is effectively monovalent at this site. The results therefore substantiate the positions of antigenic sites A, B, and E and in the ease of site B give an indication of the extent of this region at the distal tip of the BHA molecule. It would also be of interest to examine antibodies specific for sites C and D but we have not characterized antibodies prepared against X-31 virus which recognize amino acids in these sites.FIG.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We have also examined whether thermal behavior can emerge in systems that do not obey ETH when the initial state is produced by a quench.

More specifically, QET states that \u00c2(\u03c4 ) will be close to the microcanonical average of \u00c2 in the following sense: | \u00c2(\u03c4 ) -\u00c2 mc | 2 < \u01eb 2 \u00c22 mc for all but a fraction \u03b4 of times t, where the subscript mc denotes the microcanonical average over the energy window of all states with nonzero C \u03b1 , and \u01eb and \u03b4 are small numbers.

Most recently, the first active specific immunotherapeutic approach, a cancer vaccine, has passed the final phase of human testing and its approval by the FDA is pending. However, evidence suggests that the full protective and therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines has not yet been achieved. Through multiple mechanisms, tumors promote conditions in the tumor-bearing host that mitigate or even eliminate the vaccine-induced antitumor response. Restoration of the impaired immune function is, therefore, imperative for achieving optimum vaccine efficacy. Targeted pharmacological interventions are capable of overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, and thereby enable cancer vaccination to reach its full therapeutic potential. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n67 recruitment of bone-marrow-derived cells Tumorrecruited bonemarrowderived cells (BMDCs) mediate tumorinduced immune suppression, promote tumor vascularization, and stimulate tumor meta stasis.

Seemingly, tumor growth and metastatic develop ment can be prevented by reducing the trafficking of BMDCs into tumor sites (Figure 3). 25 Several mol ecules and mechanisms can modulate tumormediated recruitment of BMDCs, including veGF receptors and chemokine CXCL12-CXCR4mediated pathways. 17,[72][73][74][75][76][77] Overexpression of veGF promotes mobilization of veGFR1 + CXCR4 + BMDCs into the peripheral blood, and thus promotes immuno suppression.

It is well known that in these processes cell movements can be guided by gradients of various chemical signals. In this study, we demonstrate that cell movement can also be guided by purely physical interactions at the cell-substrate interface. We cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 fibroblasts on flexible polyacrylamide sheets coated with type I collagen. A transition in rigidity was introduced in the central region of the sheet by a discontinuity in the concentration of the bis-acrylamide cross-linker. Cells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate \"durotaxis.\" In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe differences in traction forces, cell speed, and spreading area were statistically significant (p \u03ed 0.02, 0.0001, and 0.0003, respectively).  pieces of tissue explants are plated millimeters apart on collagen gels (Harris et al., 1981). In reality, the movement of cells within a complex organism or embryo is probably guided by a complex interplay among chemical and physical signals, which may include substrate rigidity as well as forces generated by fluid shear and cell-cell interactions.While the current observations provide direct evidence for the guidance of cell migration by substrate rigidity and mechanical forces, related phenomena have been reported in recent decades. For example, Kolega observed that stretching with a microneedle causes an epithelial cell to withdraw its lateral protrusion while maintaining its dimension along the direction of tension (Kolega, 1986). With neurons, similar manipulations were found to stimulate the elongation of neurite, a phenomenon referred to as \"towed growth\" (Bray, 1984;Lamoureux et al., 1989;Chada et al., 1997).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, increases in substrate rigidity can cause an increase in traction forces, which would then pull the region forward and trigger a bias in movement direction and an increase in spreading. Such force-induced cytoskeletal contractility has also been suggested in studies that used twisting magnetic forces or dragging forces of an optical trap to apply forces to integrinbound beads. The cells responded by increasing the resistive forces and/or reinforcing the integrin-cytoskeleton linkages (Wang et al., 1993;Choquet et al., 1997). Based on these observations, Sheetz et al. (1998) speculated that stiffness of the ECM might function as an environmental cue to orient the direction of cell movement. Our observation that 3T3 cells are able to probe the rigidity of the substrates and regulate their traction forces and movement represents a direct demonstration of this guidance mechanism in action.It is unclear how cells actually translate substrate rigidity into downstream responses. One possibility is that cells can directly sense the distance of receptor movement as a result of exerted probing forces.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nCells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate \"durotaxis.\" In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nINTRODUCTIONCell migration plays an important role in numerous physiological and pathological processes, such as morphogenesis (Juliano and Haskill, 1993), wound healing (Martin, 1997), and tumor metastasis (Bernstein and Liotta, 1994).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The aim of this study was thus to test the hypothesis that core members of the mammalian Hippo pathway are expressed in skeletal muscle and that the transcriptional co-factor Yap, a core member of the Hippo pathway, regulates C2C12 myogenesis. We found that the major components of the mammalian Hippo pathway including Yap are all expressed in skeletal muscles, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. In C2C12 myoblasts, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low and Yap localises to nuclei. Upon differentiation, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increases approximately 20-fold and Yap translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol. To test whether the observed increase of Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is required for differentiation we overexpressed hYAP1 S127A, a mutant that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127, in C2C12 myoblasts. We found that overexpression of hYAP S127A prevented myotube formation, whereas the overexpression of wildtype hYAP1 or empty vector had no effect. In addition, more hYAP1 S127A overexpressing cells progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle and the expression of MRFs (myogenin, Myf5), Mef2c and cell cycle regulators (p21, cyclin D1) was significantly changed when compared to wildtype hYAP1 and empty vector overexpressing cells. This data suggests that the phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 leads to a changed expression of MRFs and cell cycle regulators and is required for C2C12 myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS1b.

The likely mechanism is that the Yap Ser127 residue is phosphorylated by Lats1/2 [10,14,19] and that Ser127 phosphorylated Yap is then sequestered by 14-3-3 binding proteins in the cytosol [11][12][13]. Our data suggest that Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is an essential differentiation event because the overexpression of a hYAP1 S127A mutant, which can not be phosphorylated at residue 127, prevents myotube formation and the expression of late differentiation markers (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 in Supplementary data).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nYap is unphosphorylated and localises to the nucleus in C2C12 myoblasts. At the onset of differentiation Yap becomes phosphorylated at Ser127 and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Ser127 phosphorylation is required for terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells because if the concentration of Yap that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127 is increased by overexpressing a hYAP1 S127A mutant then myoblasts withdraw less from the cell cycle and do not differentiate into myotubes (see Fig. S4 for a schematic drawing). We therefore identify Yap as a novel regulator of C2C12 myogenesis.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

To identify genes governing endolysosomal dynamics, we conducted a global fluorescence-based screen to reveal endomembrane effector genes. Screening implicated Phox (PX) domain\u2013containing protein Mdm1 in endomembrane dynamics. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that Mdm1 is a novel interorganelle tethering protein that localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013vacuole/lysosome membrane contact sites (MCSs). We show that Mdm1 is ER anchored and contacts the vacuole surface in trans via its lipid-binding PX domain. Strikingly, overexpression of Mdm1 induced ER\u2013vacuole hypertethering, underscoring its role as an interorganelle tether. We also show that Mdm1 and its paralogue Ydr179w-a (named Nvj3 in this study) localize to ER\u2013vacuole MCSs independently of established tether Nvj1. Finally, we find that Mdm1 truncations analogous to neurological disease\u2013associated SNX14 alleles fail to tether the ER and vacuole and perturb sphingolipid metabolism. Our work suggests that human Mdm1 homologues may play previously unappreciated roles in interorganelle communication and lipid metabolism. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThey further suggest that mitochondria-vacuole membrane contact sites (MCSs) are regions of phospholipid exchange, which, together with ER-mitochondrial encounter structures, are essential for mitochondrial lipid metabolism (Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014;H\u00f6nscher et al., 2014).In addition to mitochondria, the ER also forms MCSs with endosomes and lysosomes (vacuoles in yeast; Pan et al., 2000;Eden et al., 2010;Friedman et al., 2013;Rowland et al., 2014). Indeed, EM studies showed that the ER and endosomes are closely juxtaposed, allowing the ER-resident phosphatase PTP1B to regulate the sorting of EGF receptors at late endosomes in trans (Eden et al., 2010). Additionally, the endosomal sterol-binding protein STARD3 has recently been proposed to bind in trans to ER-localized vesicle-associated proteins, thereby localizing sterol transfer to ER-endosome MCSs (Alpy et al., 2013).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMembrane contacts between endosomes and ER provide sites for PTP1B-epidermal growth factor receptor interaction\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEREden\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIJWhite\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tATsapara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCEFutter\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

During reperfusion after filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion, ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels increased in ischemic mouse brain. Ischemic injury decreased after intracerebroventricular injections of ICE-like protease inhibitors, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.FMK), acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, or a relatively selective inhibitor of CPP32-like caspases, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, but not a cathepsin B inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone. z-VAD.FMK decreased ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive IL-1\u03b2 levels in ischemic mouse brain and reduced tissue damage when administered to rats as well. Only z-VAD.FMK and acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone reduced brain swelling, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone did not attenuate the ischemia-induced increase in tissue IL-1\u03b2 levels. The three cysteine protease inhibitors significantly improved behavioral deficits, thereby showing that functional recovery of ischemic neuronal tissue can follow blockade of enzymes associated with apoptotic cell death. Finally, we examined the effect of z-VAD.FMK on excitotoxicity and found that it protected against \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-induced or to a lesser extent N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced excitotoxic brain damage. Thus, ICE-like and CPP32-like caspases contribute to mechanisms of cell death in ischemic and excitotoxic brain injury and provide therapeutic targets for stroke and neurodegenerative brain damage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTwenty-two hours later, the brains were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for morphometric analysis. z-VAD.FMK (8, 27, or 80 ng) was injected i.c.v. 15 min before ischemia and 10 min after reperfusion in 2 equal doses (4 l per dose; 1.5 mm lateral, 0.8 mm posterior from bregma, 4.0 mm below bone surface).Neurological Deficit.

Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or non-subcellular resolution. It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCR is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins, or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein activation, or that internalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response. Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternate interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCR are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR, and its cognate G protein, Gs in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCR is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins 2,3 , or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein activation [4][5][6][7][8][9] , or that\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\ninternalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response 10 .

We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo.Ligand binding to the extracellular surface of the \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor (\u03b2 2 -AR) produces an activating conformational change in the receptor that promotes guanine nucleotide dissociation from the cytoplasmic GTP-binding protein G\u03b1 s ; this represents the critical biochemical event initiating classical GPCR signal transduction (Fig. 1a) 13 . Activated \u03b2 2 -ARs are substrates for phosphorylation and binding of \u03b2-arrestins, events which inhibit interaction with G proteins and promote endocytosis of receptors via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) 14,15 . Acute \u03b2 2 -AR G\u03b1 s signalling is thus traditionally thought to be restricted to the plasma membrane 14,16,17 . However, to our knowledge, this assumption has not been directly tested.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe results provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that \u03b2 2 -AR endocytosis contributes to a second phase of the acute cellular cAMP response, which represents a significant component of the overall biochemical signal developed within several minutes after the initial agonist application. Thus, while it remains clear that \u03b2 2 -ARs can elicit G s -mediated signal transduction from the plasma membrane, the present data reveal a discrete component of the acute signalling response that is initiated from endosomes (Fig. 4g). It remains unknown if \u03b2 2 -ARs are continuously bound by agonist in endosomes, as depicted in the figure for simplicity, but conformational activation of G s in endosomes is both receptor and agonist-dependent. Unambiguous detection of endosome-based activation of acute G-protein-linked signalling is presently limited to the \u03b2 2 -AR G s system for which the critical nanobodies are available. However, we believe that endosome-based contribution to the acute signalling response is likely widespread in the GPCR superfamily because the \u03b2 2 -AR belongs to the largest group (family A) of GPCR and is often considered a prototype.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), a chemokine that is transiently and significantly up-regulated during inflammation, is able to disrupt the integrity of BBB and modulate the progression of various diseases, including excitotoxic injury and hemorrhage. In this review, we first introduce the biochemistry and biology of MCP1, and then summarize the effects of MCP1 on BBB integrity as well as individual BBB components. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn contrast, microglia have also been shown to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which induce direct cytotoxicity by binding to their receptors (TNFRs and IL-1RI, respectively) and activating downstream cell death pathways [229]. Given that microglia are found in the perivascular space, it is speculated that microglia may play an important role in regulating BBB integrity by interacting with other BBB components, including BMeCs, astrocyte endfeet, and pericytes [230]. There is evidence showing that microglial activation restores BBB integrity after the disruption of BBB [231]. In contrast, TNF-\u03b1 released from activated microglia has been shown to impair BBB integrity [232], possibly through TNF-\u03b1-induced direct cytotoxicity on BMeCs. This discrepancy may be due to different injury models and different timing after injury. Therefore, further investigations are needed to clarify the role of microglia in BBB permeability.As indicated by its name, MCP1 is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and microglia.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates the blood-brain barrier dysfunction induced by activated microglia in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTNishioku\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMatsumoto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSDohgu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNSumi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKMiyao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFTakata\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHShuto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAYamauchi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYKataoka\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Pharmacol Sci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t112\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRecruitment of the inflammatory subset of monocytes to sites of ischemia induces angiogenesis in a monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-dependent fashion\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBJCapoccia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADGregory\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDCLink\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Leukoc Biol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t84\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2008\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA large number of molecules have been reported to affect the permeability of BBB, such as MCP1, TNF-\u03b1, .Here, we focus on the effect of MCP1 on BBB integrity.It has been shown that injection of recombinant mouse MCP1 into the brain disrupts BBB integrity [65-67, 71, 72]. we have previously been able to further demonstrate that plasmin-mediated truncation of MCP1 is indispensable for MCP1-induced BBB compromise [71]. Consistent with our report, tPA, which converts inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, has been found to promote BBB disruption and subsequent peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) infiltration [73]. Additionally, BBB compromise and PBMC infiltration have also been found in mice deficient for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [74], suggesting that the effect of MCP1 on BBB is dependent on plasmin activity. MCP1, however, failed to compromise BBB integrity in CCR2 -/-mice [67], suggesting that the effect of MCP1 on BBB also depends on CCR2. The next question then becomes how exactly MCP1-CCR2 axis affects the integrity of BBB.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Moreover, we find that the mesoporous scaffold can tune the emissive properties of the semiconducting compound both in terms of spectral region and dynamics.

The difficulty in predicting the response of these materials to the interaction with external stimuli makes it impossible to frame them as a proper technology.

As a further evolution, thin film architectures have been particularly successful 6,11,12 demonstrating performances comparable to traditional inorganic thin-film solar cells. 13,14 While we have borne witness to unbelievable progress and evolution of photovoltaic devices based on these materials, the huge gap in understanding when moving from the pristine molecules to their embodiment in a device can severely hamper their widespread adoption in optoelectronic applications. From the literature it is clear that every preliminary test of these materials in device architectures has revealed exciting surprises, however their working mechanisms remain remarkably obscure.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Thus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.DuCHENNE muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene located on the X chromosome. Dystrophin, the high-molecular weight protein product of the DMD gene 1 , is localized to the sarcolemmal membrane of normal skeletal muscle 2 -5 but is absent from the skeletal muscle of people with DMD 1 \u2022 2 \u2022 6 , xmd dogs 7 and mdx mice 1 \u2022 5 (the last two being possible animal models for DMD). The amino-acid sequence of dystrophin suggests that it is a membrane cytoskeletal protein 8 \u2022 9 involved in the anchoring of sarcolemmal proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton. But the exact function of dystrophin and its precise role in the resulting necrosis of dystrophic muscle fibres has not been determined.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor example, muscle from mdx mice shows elevated intracellular ionized Ca 2 + levels and corresponding higher net degradation of muscle proteins 20 \u2022 Loss of a dystrophin-anchored protein with a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium could result in elevated intracellular calcium levels and lead to the reported activation of calciumdependent protease activities 21 \u2022 Such a mechanism could explain the abnormal muscle protein degradation and fibre necrosis of dystrophic muscle.The absence of dystrophin-associated proteins in dystrophic muscle may complicate the therapeutic efficacy of myoblast transfer 22 , as the reintroduction of dystrophin synthesis might not lead to recovery of associated protein levels and thus could necessitate treatment at only one particular developmental stage. Finally, a deficiency or defect in a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein could perhaps explain the DMD-like symptoms observed in suspected autosomal-recessive patients 23 \u2022 24 that express apparently normal dystrophin.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nof Iowa College of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t52242\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIowa City\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIowa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevinPCampbell\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoward Hughes Medical Institute\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Physiology and Biophysics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Iowa College of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t52242\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIowa City\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIowa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDeficiency of a glycoprotein component of the dystrophin complex in dystrophic muscle\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t9B3C19F6A58E1CBFAE65FE1ED7F30F55\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nDystrophin, the protein encoded by the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, exists in a large oligomeric complex.

They exhibit a significantly improved dispersibility in organic solvents such as\ntetrahydrofurane and dichloromethane. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the latter solvent no sedimentation was observed for a period of one month. The particle size of the agglomerates in the suspensions was reduced from several micron (pristine ND: \u223c 15 \u03bcm, ND-OH: \u223c 6 \u03bcm) to 300-450 nm in the case of ND-OOC-C 3 H 7 (2), 150-260 nm for ND-OOC-C 5 H 11 (3), \u223c170 nm for ND-OOC-C 12 H 23 (4), and 170-300 nm for ND-OOC-C 18 H 37 (5). Fig. 3 shows the development of suspensions of pristine detonation diamond and compounds 1-5 in dichloromethane.The stable dispersion of functionalised nanodiamond in organic solvents opens the way to further surface modification in more homogeneous systems leading to better accessibility of the surface groups as well as a more homogeneous distribution of the diamond particles in the medium. Carboxylic groups with terminal surface groups have to be reacted with the diamond surface if further reactions are to be carried out. This work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOn the other hand, their surface can be functionalised with a variety of groups in order to incorporate them into polymer matrices, surface coatings and the like [3]. An essential prerequisite for these applications is the control of surface structure and particle size and agglomeration.So far, different approaches for the surface functionalisation and deagglomeration have been taken. Chiganova produced diamond hydrosols from oxidized detonation diamond [4], whereas Xu and coworkers used surface active compounds for the dispersion of nanodiamond particles [5]. Khabashesku et al. obtained small agglomerates of \u223c160 nm in size by the fluorination of detonation diamond [6]. These particles formed stable suspensions in THF. Another approach is the mechanical deagglomeration in suspension by stirred media milling [7] or beads assisted sonic disintegration [8].Covalent surface modification of nanodiamond has been reported by several authors. Reactions with fluorine [6], chlorine [9], ammonia [10] and hydrogen [10,11] lead to homogenized, surface modified nanodiamond materials with increased reactivity and the option for further functionalisation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\nConclusionIn summary we have modified the surface of hydroxylated detonation nanodiamond with alkyl chains of different length by an esterification reaction of carboxylic acid chlorides with the surface hydroxyl groups. The resulting materials had a surface loading of 0.3-0.4 mmol g -1 and showed a much better dispersibility in several organic solvents along with a smaller particle size of the remaining agglomerates. This enables the homogeneous incorporation of such materials in non-hydrophilic matrices and further modification in stable suspension. In the future, it will be important to further reduce the agglomerate size by such chemical deagglomeration and stabilization techniques down to the primary particles.Fig. 2 .2Fig. 2.

These methods have begun to unravel key questions in cancer biology that have been difficult to address with bulk tumor measurements. Over the past five years, there has been extraordinary progress in technological developments and research applications, but these efforts represent only the tip of the iceberg. In the coming years, SCS will greatly improve our understanding of invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance during cancer progression. These tools will also have direct translational applications in the clinic, in areas such as early detection, noninvasive monitoring, and guiding targeted therapy. In this perspective, I discuss the progress that has been made and the myriad of unexplored applications that still lie ahead in cancer research and medicine. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe problem is that single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing data sets have unique characteristics and technical errors that violate the assumptions of standard variant detection and expression analysis algorithms that were designed for bulk NGS data (Stegle et al. 2015;Wang and Navin 2015).In the future, it will be important to begin connecting genotypic information with phenotypic information in single cells. This can be accomplished by connecting live-cell imaging techniques (Sabouri-Ghomi et al. 2008) or intravital imaging in mice (Alexander et al. 2013) with SCS methods to measure phenotypic properties in single cancer cells prior to isolation and genomic anal-ysis. Another important direction involves connecting in situ spatial information of single cancer cells in tissue sections to their genomic and transcriptomic profiles (Crosetto et al. 2015). This can be accomplished by isolating single cells from tissue sections using LCM, or alternatively by sequencing single cells directly in tissue sections using novel single-cell RNA sequencing methods (Lee et al. 2014;Lovatt et al. 2014).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntegrated genomic analysis identifies clinically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma characterized by abnormalities in PDGFRA, IDH1, EGFR, and NF1\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRGVerhaak\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKAHoadley\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEPurdom\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYQi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMDWilkerson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCRMiller\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLDing\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTGolub\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPMesirov\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCancer Cell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t17\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAdvances and applications of single-cell sequencing technologies\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNENavin\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMol Cell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t58\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tClonal evolution in breast cancer revealed by single nucleus genome sequencing\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWaters\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLLeung\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAUnruh\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWRoh\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXShi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKChen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPScheet\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSVattathil\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHLiang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t512\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSingle-cell mutational profiling and clonal phylogeny in cancer\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNEPotter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLErmini\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEPapaemmanuil\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGCazzaniga\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGVijayaraghavan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tITitley\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAFord\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPCampbell\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLKearney\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGreaves\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGenome Res\n\t\t\n\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSingle cell profiling of circulating tumor cells: transcriptional heterogeneity and diversity from breast cancer cell lines\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAPowell\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAHTalasaz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMACoram\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAReddy\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGDeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLTelli\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRHAdvani\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRWCarlson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJAMollick\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPLoS One\n\t\t\n\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t33788\n\t\t\t2012\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A circularly polarized light is completely converted to the cross-polarized light which can either be bent or focused tightly near the diffraction limit. It depends on a precise control of the optical-axis profile of the antennas on a subwavelength scale, in which the rotation angle of the optical axis has a simple linear relationship to the phase discontinuity. Such an approach enables effective wave front engineering within a subwavelength scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2. Illustration of the additional linear phase discontinuity through structured metamaterial surface. One of the electric field component(x) distributions for the left-handed circular polarization incidence (a) and right-handed circular polarization normal incidence (b) indicate the wave front across the resonator interface induced by the additional wave vector contribution. The far field directivity illuminates the bending phenomenon due to the induced linear phase discontinuity through rotating optical axis for left-handed circular polarization incidence(c) and right-handed circular polarization incidence (d).\nlight are correspondingly influenced by the dispersion of the material. Up to now, we could design and manipulate the output wave front though spatial rotation of the resonator arrays. As examples to demonstrate our proposal, we investigate two kinds of one dimensional phase profiles to demonstrate general manipulation of the wave front:c = t0.51 t t -for 2cross-polarized sin t ntnisini2d dxA: Linear phase discontinuity:The generalized version of Snell's Law is in the form[9,10,12,13]:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWe have completed the schematic description, in the next step we need to design the subwavelength metallic antenna to realize the desired anisotropic EM response.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1.
