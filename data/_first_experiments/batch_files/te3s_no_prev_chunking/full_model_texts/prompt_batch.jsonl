This paper proposes a fault analysis method of motors based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis. To achieve this goal, fault fuzzy production rules of three-phase induction motors are first proposed. Then, the rMFRSNPS is presented to model the rules, which provides an intuitive way for modelling the motors. Moreover, to realize the parallel data computing and information reasoning in the fault prediction and diagnosis process, three reasoning algorithms for the rMFRSNPS are proposed: the pulse value reasoning algorithm, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm, and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm. Finally, some case studies are given, in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMoreover, the proposed method can meet the needs of a motor for its overall fault analysis.

On the other hand, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent analysis and diagnosis methods are gradually developed, such as expert systems (ESs)  [15] , artificial neural networks (ANNs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , Petri nets (PNs)  [21] [22] [23] , tissue P systems (TPSs)  [24] [25] [26] , and spiking neural P systems (SNPSs)  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Specifically, SNPS is a novel high-performance bioinspired distributed parallel computing model with powerful information processing ability.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhen the fault reasoning is finished, faulty sections are finally determined based on the fault confidence levels according to criterion rules. Because of the high requirement of fault diagnosis methods for processing fault information, the SNPS-based diagnosis methods have become a hot research topic with rich research results  [27-29, 33, 34] . However, up to now, the relevant research work is mainly focused on the fault diagnosis of power systems. Besides, the existing work mainly studies the postevent diagnosis problems. -erefore, to give full play to the excellent information processing ability and computing power of SNPSs, it is of great importance to expand their scope to different application fields, as well as extend the applications from the postante ones to new ex-ante analysis and prediction frameworks. -erefore, this paper moves forward in this widening of the scope of SNPSs. More specifically, the work proposes a fault analysis method based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for threephase induction motors.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These correlations outputs might show some detour versus experimental ones; however less costs of researchers encouraged researchers to follow that field to present more accurate correlations at various working conditions  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The expensive steps of stabilize and dispersing the nanoparticles, are able to be ignored through the numerical works; moreover all the nanofluid behaviors can be predicted by a simple optimization approach according to the available empirical results. Among these optimization approaches, the artificial neural network (ANN) was used in many studies to predict the nanofluid properties especially for its thermal conductivity and viscosity. Moreover appropriate accuracy of this method encouraged researchers to develop more new models of ANN to have better consistency with the existence physical conditions of a nanofluid flow . In the following, 24 dissimilar ANN methods are examined at present work by introducing the suitable architectures and training algorithms of these using approaches.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nThe mixture composed of nanoparticles dispersed through a base liquid, which is called nanofluid, plays a significant role in MEMS & NEMS. It should be mentioned that the nanoparticles concentration have be small to avoid from undesired behaviors such as settlements. The Brownian motions of nanoparticles are able to increase the convection mechanism through the base fluid; however their main important effect would be improve the mixture effective thermal conductivity. That implies the better performance of nanoparticles with more thermal conductivity coefficient. This fact has been reported in many articles for various types of nanoparticles  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Meanwhile, the amount of nanoparticles concentration has an important influence on the mixture thermal behavior especially at different values of working temperature. Other effective thermo-physical properties can be addressed as like the nanoparticles density, specific heat and their shapes and diameters. It is well known that in addition of nanofluid thermal conductivity, the mixture effective viscosity should be evaluated due to its performance in a flow pumping power; so that a large number of works can be referred concerned these aspects of nanofluid properties.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo do this, the MSEs between the targets and the ANN outputs of the examined methods are evaluated while the results would be supported by the appropriate sensitivity analysis.\n\nProblem statement\nThe artificial neural network (ANN) optimization method is evaluated according to the experimental results of Bahrami et al.

Present work novelty is demonstrated by providing 24 dissimilar ANN methods to introduce the suitable architectures and training algorithms for them .

Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe second study analyzed 325 patients with 173 in the propofol group and 152 in the sevoflurane group. No difference was observed in the overall 5-year survival rate between two groups, although the propofol group did have a lower rate of cancer recurrence (p = 0.037)  [48] . The third study collected 2645 cases, which included 2589 in the volatile anesthesia group and 56 in the propofol group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative recurrence or survival probability  [49] . Taken together, these studies suggest that propofol may either improve overall survival rates or lower the rate of cancer recurrence, but the evidence is not overwhelming. It is good to consider the limitations of these studies. First, there is the inherent limitation of retrospective studies in that they do not standardize clinical care and do not randomize patient groups. Therefore, the effects of confounding factors and selection bias cannot be easily eliminated. Second, one of the studies (Lee et al.  [49] ) had a relative small patient population and another (Kim et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nConcomitantly, the serum from propofol/paravertebral patients increased the expression of the surface protein CD107a on NK cells without alteration of normal NK marker expression or secretion of cytokines  [21] . CD107a is upregulated in stimulated NK cells and this correlates with NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells  [22] . Serum from the sevoflurane patient reduced NK cell activating receptor CD16, IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, all thus lowering the activity level of NK cells  [22, 23] .\n\nPro-tumor effects\nIn 2002, Garib et al. observed that propofol (3-9 \u03bcg/mL) increased migration of MDA-MB-468 cells  [24] . They also found that propofol increased intracellular calcium and altered the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of these cells  [25] . These effects of propofol were inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. The group tested the hypothesis that propofol was acting via GABA-A receptor chloride channels.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe effect could be attributable to either the vertebral block, propofol or both  [46] .\n\nPropofol and clinical trials in breast cancer\nThree retrospective studies have compared propofol with volatile anesthetic agents on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery (Table  2 ). The first study, published in 2014 by Enlund and colleagues, reviewed surgical data from 1837 breast cancer patients with 620 in the propofol group and 1217 in the sevoflurane group. Differences in overall survival rates (propofol vs sevoflurane) for breast cancer were 3% (95% confidence interval, 1 to 4%, p < 0.001) at 1 year, and 2% (-2 to 6%, non-significant) at 5 years, in favor of propofol. However, the observed differences were eliminated after adjustment for confounders (history of cardiac ischemia was 1.8 times more likely in the sevoflurane group)  [47] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In Chagas disease, pleiotropic cytokine TNF is considered key in immunopathology. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the levels of TNF, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in the serum of patients with chronic Chagas disease. TNF and its soluble receptors were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array in the serum of 132 patients, of which 51 had the indeterminate form (IND), 39 the mild cardiac form (CARD 1), 42 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 non-infected individuals (NI). The results indicate that the soluble receptors may regulate TNF in Chagas disease, as their leves were higher in T. cruzi-infected individuals when compared to non-infected individuals. We found a moderate negative correlation between sTNFR1 and TNF in individuals with the IND form, suggesting a relationship with non-progression to more severe forms, such as heart disease. sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were increased in all clinical forms, but with a moderate positive correlation in more severe patients (r = 0.50 and p = 0.0005). TNF levels showed no statistical differences in the groups of patients. These findings suggest the importance of the endogenous balance of the levels of soluble TNF receptors in the protection and balance in patients with chronic Chagas disease, besides revealing the immunological complexity in chronic T. cruzi-infected individuals. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs perspectives, we aim to address the mechanisms of TNFR activity in the peripheral blood cell from Chagas disease patients. Studies on cytokine profiles and frequency of receptors involved in apoptosis would also contribute to a better understanding of the immunopathology of chronic Chagas disease. \n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n\nDiego\n\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIndividuals with the IND form present a less inflammatory profile but with persistence of the parasite  (Curvo et al., 2018) . We also believe that this decrease in TNF is related to the lack of activation of a Th1 profile or that other cell profiles, such as Th17, contribute more to the intracellular elimination of T. cruzi. Therefore other cytokines should be evaluated, such as IL-10 and IL-17  (Cai et al., 2016) . In in vitro models, IL-10 acts inhibiting the pro-inflammatory activity of TNF indirectly by increasing soluble receptors and decreasing transmembrane receptors or by directly inhibiting TNF release  (Joyce et al., 1994) .\n\nConclusion\nAll findings suggest the importance of the endogenous balance of soluble TNF receptors, which may indicate protection to patients with chronic Chagas disease. In addition, the TNF/TNFR1 route seems to be paramount in the course of the disease in humans. Our results on TNF cytokine corroborate other recent studies and highlight the complexity of the immune response against T. cruzi in chronic CD.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHighly inflammatory and considered the most pleiotropic cytokine, TNF performs functions in several cell types and is associated with several infectious, autoimmune, neoplastic, and inflammatory pathologies  (Sedger and Mcdermott, 2014, Jang et al., 2021) . TNF is expressed initially as a transmembrane protein (mTNF) in several immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, and T lymphocytes, in addition to endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes  (Issuree et al., 2013) . By the action of the TNF-converting enzyme (TACE), mTNF is converted into soluble TNF (sTNF), which is the circulating form with an endocrine capacity to act in distant locations  (Sedger and Mcdermott, 2014) . The sTNF and mTNF bind to transmembrane receptors, TNFR1 or CD120a and TNFR2 or CD120b, with mTNF a more powerful binder for TNFR2, and sTNF for TNFR1.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We investigated the association of physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process with blood glucose level. Methods 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET scans acquired from 44 patients (male:female=20:24, age=50.8\u00b114.8y [mean\u00b1SD]) were retrospectively analyzed. The blood glucose level (BGL) was examined before 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC injection. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and patients with BGL over 200\u00a0mg/dl were excluded. 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake was measured by the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). Additionally, SSTR-positive volume (SV) in the pancreas uncinate process was measured with two diferent thresholds: by SUV cutof of 2.5 (SV2.5) and 40% of SUVmax (SV40%). These measurements on 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET were correlated with BGL. Results The mean of SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process was 6.51\u00b12.04. SV2.5 was 17.81\u00b17.14 cm3 , and SV40% was 18.20\u00b18.83 cm3 . A signifcant negative correlation was found between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BGL (r=-0.37, p=0.01). The ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the pancreas body also showed a signifcance negative correlation with BGL (r=-0.40, p=0.01). SV2.5 (r=0.27, p=0.07) and SV40% (r=-0.151, p=0.32) were not signifcantly correlated with BGL. Conclusion Physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process was negatively correlated with BGL. Our results suggested that glycemia could afect physiologic uptake of 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe continuous variables were represented by mean \u00b1 SD. The correlation was analyzed by Pearson correlation, and a p value of 0.05 or lower was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA).\n\nResults\n\n\nPatient Characteristics\nThe mean age of 44 patients was 50.8 years (SD, 14.8; range, 7-71). Among 44 patient, 22 (50%) patients were diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, of which 9 patients with pancreatic NET, 8 patients with rectal NET, and 5 patients with other or unknown origins. Twelve patients (27%) were diagnosed as pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Other 10 (23%) patients were diagnosed with other tumors except NET including meningioma. Demographics and diagnosis of patients were summarized in Table  1 . BGL of 44 patients were 107.5 \u00b1 37.5 mg/dL (70-145 mg/dL), and the distribution of BGL is shown in Fig.  2 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the normal pancreas body showed a significant negative correlation with BGL (r = -0.40, p = 0.01), and the ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BP SUVmean also showed a significant negative correlation with BGL (r = -0.34, p = 0.02). However, two volume measurements on 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET were not significantly correlated with BGL: r = 0.274 and p = 0.068 for the correlation between SV 2.5 and BGL and r = -0.15 and p = 0.32 for the correlation between SV 40% and BGL. There was no significant correlation between patient age and SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process (r = -0.17, p = 0.27). Representative cases with high and low BGL are shown in Fig.  3 . The result of correlation analysis between BGL and 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET parameters is shown in Fig.  4 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause PP is affected by glycemic conditions, we evaluated whether glycemia was associated with 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process. We found a correlation between blood glucose level (BGL) and 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process. While a significant negative correlation between BGL level and SUV parameters of 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake was found, volume measurements defined by PET showed no significant correlation with BGL. Our findings imply that BGL could affect SSTR expression in the PP cells enriched in the pancreas uncinate process. Since SSTR is not fixed on cell membrane and is a dynamic structure capable of functions such as internalization, trafficking, and recycling  [11, 12] , rapid molecular response in SSTR expression could be triggered by glycemic conditions. Of note, volume measurements were not correlated with BGL. It suggested the tissue volume of PP cell rich islets in the pancreas could not be rapidly changed according to the glycemic condition. Moreover, it implied that glycemic conditions affect the functional activity of PP cells which might be represented by SSTR expression rather than increased volume of PP cell enriched region.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Codon optimization is a frequently used strategy to accelerate protein synthesis rate. Besides regulating protein translation speed, codon usage bias has also be reported to affect co-translation folding and transcription. P. pastoris is a well-developed expression system, whose efficiency is tightly correlated with commercial value. However, few studies focus on the role of codon usage bias in affecting protein expression in P. pastoris. Besides, many genes in P. pastoris genome show significant negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency. It's not known whether this feature is important for their expression. In order to answer these questions, we picked 4P. pastoris gene candidates with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder. We then performed full-length codon optimization which completely eliminated the correlation. Protein and RNA assays were then used to compare protein and mRNA levels before and after codon optimization. As a result, codon optimization failed to elevate their protein expression levels, and even resulted in a decrease. As represented by the trypsin sensitivity assays, codon optimization also altered the protein structure of 0616 and 0788. Besides protein, codon optimization also affected mRNA levels. Shown by in vitro and in vivo RNA degradation assays, the mRNA stability of 0616, 0788 and 0135 were also altered by codon optimization. For each gene, the detailed effect may be related with its specific sequence and protein structure. Our results suggest that codon usage bias is an important factor to regulate gene expression level, as well as mRNA and protein stabilities in P. pastoris. \"Extreme\" codon optimization in genes with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency may not be favored. Compromised strategies should be tried if expression is not successful. Besides, codon optimization may affect protein structural conformation more severely in structural disordered proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs reported by many studies in P. pastoris, codon optimization has also been applied in a couple of endogenous and heterologous proteins including PAS_chr2-2_0376  (Xu et al., 2021) , lysozyme  (He et al., 2020) , \u03b1-amylase  (Huang et al., 2017) , polygalacturonase  (Karaoglan and Erden-Karaoglan, 2020)  and GFP (data not shown). The effects were not bad, with an elevation by different extents instead of reduction. Compared with the 4 gene candidates here, these genes are with much weaker negative correlation between codon usage bias and secondary structural disorder. Therefore, the poor optimization phenotype in gene studied here may be correlated with the strong negative correlation. However, more examples still need to be given to strengthen this correlation and reveal more inner mechanisms under it.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBoth 0013 and 0788 are predicted to be ribosomal proteins. The other two candidates are annotated as hypothetical proteins without a defined function. CAI value, disorder tendency score and their correlation are shown in Table  1 . The genome average correlation is 0.0383  (Xu et al., 2021) , and all these four genes have a correlation below -0.5 (ranked within top 1% of all the 2084 genes with negative correlation, Table  S3 ). Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) and disorder curves along the ORF are plotted in Fig.  1 . Among the 4 gene candidates, 0616 seems to have highest disorder tendency while 0013, 0135, and 0788 seem to have lower disorder tendency.\n\nCodon optimization affects both protein and mRNA expression levels of the gene candidates studied\nCodon optimization was then performed on these genes, which completely eliminated the negative correlation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAgain, the faster degradation rates of 0616opt and 0135opt may be a contributing factor for their compromised mRNA levels (Fig.  3B&D ).\n\nConclusion and discussion\nIn this study, we picked 4 gene candidates in P. pastoris with extreme negative correlation between codon usage bias and structural disorder tendency. In order to study the importance of the negative correlation, we performed codon optimization on these 4 genes to completely eliminate it. As a result, codon optimization failed to elevate, and even decreased their protein levels. Codon optimization also altered mRNA level, as well as protein and mRNA stabilities in some genes. The detailed effect might be related with specific gene sequence and protein structure, which differed in each gene.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Some require this external circuit to be changed during the run due to coagulopathy or mechanical failure. Circuit change(s) can result in massive fluid shifts, weight gain, and hemodynamic instability, with negative implications for the patient. Predictors for undergoing circuit changes and its impact on outcomes remain unclear. We hypothesized that circuit changes during ECMO support would correlate with increased morbidity and mortality.\nMethods\nPatients with one ECMO run lasting 30 days or less at a tertiary children\u2019s hospital between 2010-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. LASSO logistic regression models were built to identify independent predictors for undergoing a circuit change. Bivariate regression analysis was used to compare outcomes in patients undergoing a circuit change to those who did not. Primary outcome of interest was mortality on ECMO; secondary outcomes included major bleeding, neurologic, and infectious morbidities; p<0.05 was significant.\nResults\nOne hundred ninety-one patients were included; 144 (75%) had no circuit change, while 47 (25%) had one or more circuit change(s). Lower gestational age at birth (p=0.04), higher WBC (p=0.03), higher platelet transfusion during ECMO (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for undergoing a circuit change. Compared to those who did not undergo a circuit change, patients who did had longer median ECMO duration (p<0.001), higher rates of bleeding complications (p=0.02), and higher mortality (p=0.03).\nConclusion\nChanging the circuit while on ECMO support was associated with longer ECMO duration, higher mortality, and higher bleeding complications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRESULTS:\nIn the CA Trauma System 81.2% of re-triages were to the closest high-level TC. However, at the individual center level, only four NTCs (1.8%) re-triaged 90% of transfers to the closest high-level TC. When there was <50 miles of driving distance between NTC and TC, 74% of 1,216 non-optimal ground transfers could have reduced transfer times between 1-61 minutes had they re-triaged to the closest high-level TC. When there was 50 miles, 99% of non-optimal transfers could have been reduced by 1-324 minutes by driving or flying to the nearest high-level TC.

[citation 11] proposed a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Target positioning based on particle centroid drift in large-scale WSNs \nAbstract: The localization problem of target nodes remains unresolved, especially in large-scale and complex environments. In this paper, we propose a particle centroid drift (PCD) algorithm to reduce the distance errors between nodes and obtain the particle aggregation region by using the drift vector. First, we use the particle quality prediction function to obtain the particles in a high-likelihood region. The high-quality particles have high probability in the calculation, which can increase the number of effective particles and enable avoiding particle degradation. Then, the centroid drift vector is used to make the particle distribution similar to the actual reference distribution. Experiments are conducted on state-space models: the local movement where 55% nodes are moving and the globe movement where 100% nodes are moving. The results show that the proposed algorithm has low estimation errors, a good tracking effect and an acceptable time complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe drift theory was used to design a Monte Carlo procedure in a Markov chain, causing the particle samples to be similar to observations. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) proposed in  [12]  measures the distance between nodes, and the measurement error was contained in the observation function of the motion noise. As a result, the positions of objects were determined by a weighted aggregation and by maximizing the PSO. Hou et al.  [27]  proposed an improved cubature PF algorithm that uses the least squares to estimate the prior states of target nodes. The cubature Kalman filter and Gauss-Newton iterative methods were used to measure the posterior state. This work provided the suggested distribution for the PF and improved the positioning accuracy. V\u00e1zquez and M\u00edguez  [28]  introduced a distributed PF algorithm based on the posterior probability and combined it with Bayesian estimation. Experimentally, this method is superior to the distributed PF in terms of the positioning accuracy and robustness. In summary, most existing works combined the range-based and range-free methods and used additional auxiliary filters to improve the positioning accuracy.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, they did not consider the particle degradation problem and ignored the influence of various intricate environmental factors (such as the number of deployed nodes, the mobility, and the path loss factor) and PF parameters (such as the number of generated particles, the noise variation and the particle population mobility) on the positioning accuracy of the target node. In addition, they were limited by their computational complexity and convergence speed, hindering them from being applicable in a large-scale and complex environment.\n\nIII. PROPOSED ALGORITHM\nThe target node periodically broadcasts beacon packets to neighboring nodes, and each beacon packet contains its identification number and location coordinates. When the number of beacon packets exceeds a specified threshold, the node is determined to be the centroid of a polygon. Correspondingly, the centroids of its neighboring nodes are viewed as its estimation. Although the traditional PF algorithm can perform node position estimation in non-linear and non-Gaussian WSNs, it has the particle degradation problem which means particles in the higher likelihood region have bigger weights and particles that do not intersect with the prior distribution region have weights close to 0. This problem can be well addressed by predicting the posterior distribution of high-quality particle populations. PQP algorithm can be applied in this respect.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nenvironment  [5] -  [7]  because a high node density and a large communication overhead are required. Typical examples of range-free algorithms include Amorphous  [8] , Distance Vector-Hop(DV-Hop)  [9] , Multi Dimentional Scaling Map(MDS-MAP)  [10] , Distance Vector-short(DV-short)  [11]  and Approximate Point in Triangulation Test(APTT)  [12] . Moreover, many scholars have proposed using the connectiveness between nodes to determine a target's current movement position and predict its next position. Bayesianestimation-based filtering algorithms such as the Particle Filter(PF)  [13] , Extended Kalman Filter(EKF)  [14] , Extended Kalman Particle Filter(EKPF)  [15] , Unscented Kalman Filter(UKF)  [16]  and Hybrid Iterated Kalman Particle Filter(HIKPF)  [17]  are representative of this scenario.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Melanoma care and survival can be improved by early diagnosis, which can be facilitated by the use of noninvasive imaging modalities. Here we review 5 modalities available in clinical practice. Total body photography is used to follow patients at high risk for melanoma by detecting new lesions or subtle changes in existing lesions. Dermoscopy is an effective noninvasive technique for the early recognition of melanoma by allowing clinicians to visualize subsurface structures. Computer-assisted diagnostic devices are fully automated analysis systems with the capacity to classify lesions as benign or malignant with limited involvement from clinicians. Confocal scanning laser microscopy is an in vivo and noninvasive technology that examines the skin at a resolution comparable to that of histology. High-resolution ultrasound is an adjunct diagnostic aid mainly for the early detection of lymph node metastasis. Applications and limitations of each technology are discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBoth technologies can dramatically improve the clinical care of patients at high risk for melanoma. Computer-assisted diagnostic systems are a promising technology currently employed in a limited number of academic settings and specialty clinics. It should be viewed as an adjunctive tool, not a first line of diagnostic technology. CSLM is perhaps the most significant advance in optical microscopy during the past decade. It provides physicians with an unprecedented capability to visualize a lesion at a detail comparable to histology. However, many obstacles, especially the high cost, need to be resolved before it can be widely adopted for clinical care. The value of high resolution ultrasound in diagnosis is limited, but it can aid the early detection of regional lymph node involvement. Lastly, it is important to remember that all these tools should not be used in isolation in the management of patients with suspicious skin lesions. Clinical presentation, personal and family history, and even other clinically seemingly unrelated elements must all be factored into the overall diagnostic decision process.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs with many novel technologies, the high cost and bulky design of current CSLM devices are considered to be major barriers. Efforts, such as miniaturizing the device and lowering the cost of production can facilitate wider adoption. In addition, extensive training in both the acquisition and the interpretation of CSLM images is needed. Like dermoscopy, there is a steep learning curve to master the interpretation of CSLM images. Lastly, the technology has intrinsic limitations where CSLM evaluation can give rise to false-positive or falsenegative results.  64, 78, 79  \n\nHigh-Resolution Ultrasound\nMedical ultrasonography is an ultrasound-based diagnostic imaging modality used to visualize body tissue in real time. Modern ultrasound devices are both portable and relatively inexpensive when compared with other imaging modalities. The ultrasound technology is based on pulse-echo systems in which acoustic pulses are generated by a transducer and propagated to the body tissue. The return waves (echo) from the tissue are detected and converted into images for visual inspection. The resolution of the image and depth of tissue penetration is largely dependent on the frequency of the ultrasound transducer.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHigh-frequency (ie, short wavelength) scanners offer greater resolution (eg, axial resolution of 10 m and lateral resolution of 30 m) but poorer tissue penetration (eg, \u03fd2 mm). In dermatology, high-frequency (eg, \u03fe20 MHz) ultrasound is used to evaluate lesions near the skin surface. For assessment of melanocytic lesions, 50-to 100-MHz ultrasound is needed.  48, 80, 81  The application of ultrasound in the clinical management of melanoma is limited. The technology is useful to aid the detection of lymph node metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanoma.  [82] [83] [84]  Physical examination alone often fails to detect locoregional metastases or cannot unambiguously classify palpable lymph nodes. High-resolution ultrasound has been shown to have remarkable superiority over physical examination. The authors of a number of studies  84, 85  have reported high sensitivity and specificity (\u03fe90%) for detection of locoregional metastasis with the aid of ultrasound. In addition, ultrasound can be used to differentiate reactive and malignant lymph nodes based on size, shape, border, and echo density of the lymph node.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To this end, according to WSN\u2019s characteristics and based on the identity-based encryption idea, an improved identity-based encryption algorithm (IIBE) is proposed, which can effectively simplify the key generation process, reduce the network traffic, and improve the network security. The design idea of this algorithm lies between the traditional public key encryption and identity-based public tweezers\u2019 encryption. Compared with the traditional public key encryption, the algorithm does not need a public key certificate and avoids the management of the certificate.

Health information from traditional, online and social media may influence vaccine hesitancy. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of exposure to COVID-19 information from various media on vaccine hesitancy, as well as the mediating roles of public trust in government and vaccine confidence. With a sample of 438 online participants (mean age = 30.69 years) responding to an anonymous questionnaire, the study tested a mediation model using bias-corrected bootstrap. The results indicated that exposure to COVID-19 information from online news media and traditional media can reduce vaccine hesitancy indirectly. Whereas a positive and indirect relationship between COVID-19 information exposure on social media and vaccine hesitancy was revealed. Trust in government and vaccine confidence were found to be salient mediators between exposure to COVID-19 information from various media and vaccine hesitancy. Findings from this study offer implications for strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide, posing a dangerous threat to public health. By November 2021, there were about 250 million confirmed cases worldwide and well over 5 million deaths. In the past year, nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cancelling mass gathering activities, travel restrictions, and mandating social distancing) were implemented by countries to reduce the transmission of COVID-19  (Dinleyici et al., 2020; Liu, 2021 Liu, , 2020)) . In the meanwhile, health experts recognize COVID-19 vaccination as one of the most important measures for combating COVID-19 infection  (Dinleyici et al., 2020) . Recently, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has begun in many countries, such as the United States, Russia, and China  (Smith et al., 2020) . However, an alarming number of people are highly suspicious of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and refuse immunization, a behavior defined as vaccine hesitancy  (Featherstone et al., 2019; Getman et al., 2018) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe statistically acknowledged (p<.05) indirect path and unacknowledged (aka non-significant) direct path form indirect-only mediation  (Zhao et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2021) . One plausible reason is that social media contain a fair amount of misinformation that was closely related to public health  (Bode & Vraga, 2018; Chou et al., 2018) . Given that COVID-19 vaccine development was compressed in time, and news about temporary side effects of the vaccines has been reported and raised global concerns, it is worrying that misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors about COVID-19 and vaccines against the disease were spread widely on the internet  (Duffy, 2020; Liu & Huang, 2020) . Individuals who relied on social media for COVID-19 related information were more likely to be misinformed by disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines  (Burki, 2020; Wilson & Wiysonge, 2020) . The spread of disinformation and misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media can weaken people's confidence in vaccine safety and increase vaccine hesitancy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nCOVID-19 information exposure on traditional news media and online news media can reduce vaccine hesitancy via increased trust in government and improved vaccine confidence. These findings can be explained by the governmental hegemonic practices regarding the COVID-19 containment in the Chinese mass media. In China, mass media (e.g. newspaper, radio, and online news media) are under strict control of the party-state  (Yang, 2013) . As China has managed to control COVID-19 rapidly and effectively  (Liu, 2020) , COVID-19 information on news media was likely to be framed in the favor of the government, such as the Chinese government's extraordinary efforts in containing the pandemic and developing vaccines. Individuals who are more trusting of the government in handling the crisis show more confidence in Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines, therefore less likely to refuse COVID-19 vaccination. However, COVID-19 information exposure on social media was found to be positively associated with vaccine hesitancy indirectly. Exposure to COVID-19 information on social media was negatively related to vaccine confidence, and the lower vaccine confidence would increase vaccine hesitancy.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Safe fatigue lives of the NE, SiC, and Al2O3-SAJs were estimated at different reliability levels. The experimental measurements revelated that reducing the adhesive layer thickness from 0.25 mm to 0.17 mm result in enhancing the tensile strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs by 9.6% and 4.4%, respectively, in return of 9.5% and 5.4% for the Al2O3-SAJ relative to the NE-SAJ. The strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs with 0.17 mm bond thickness are higher than those of the Al2O3-SAJ by 15.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The highest improvement of 22.0% in the fatigue strength was occurred for the SiC-SAJ with bond thickness of 0.17 mm in return of 4.8% for the Al2O3-SAJ. The Up was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints practically the change in the enclosed area of the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large variation in the tan \u03b4, E'', and Ud. Damping factor of the NE-SAJs is marginally increased with the stress levels compared to the aggravated increase of both SiC and Al2O3-SAJs. Zhang model predicts well the potential energy and storage modulus specially at higher stress levels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe scatter in the fatigue life was investigated using the two parameter Weibull function. Safe fatigue lives of the NE, SiC, and Al 2 O 3 -SAJs were estimated at different reliability levels. The following conclusions are drawn from this study. The measured potential energy (area under loading curve) was increased with the increase of the stress level (\u03c3 max ) as consequence of increasing the thermal and mechanical interfacial damages in the SAJs. This result is consistent with decreasing the storage modulus (E'), which has a linear inverse relationship with Potential energy (U p ). Potential energy (U p ) was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints in which the variation in the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large change in the factor (tan \u03b4), loss modulus (E''), and dissipated energy (U d ). Zhang model predicts well the experimental measurements of the potential energy and storage modulus (E 0 ) specially at higher stress levels (i.e., high damage) at which they follow a sigmoid curve with constant increasing/ decreasing rates during the most lifetime of the joint.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAccordingly, the U p can be considered a powerful tool for monitoring and detecting the damage in the adhesive joints in which the variation in the area enclosed by the hysteresis cycle is too small to cause a large change in the U d , E'' and tan \u03b4. On the other hand, the predicted normalized potential energy of both NE and SiC-SAs show relatively less agreement with the experimental results, as shown in Figure  20 (b). Again, this behavior was attributed to the insignificant loss in the joint stiffness during stage II (main portion of joint life) that contrary to Zhang sigmoid model assumption. Hence, many efforts are required to develop analytical models that capable to monitoring and predicting the variation in the stiffness degradation as well as the increasing rate in the potential energy under low or moderate fatigue loading and thus, help in preventing the catastrophic failure of the joint without warning.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, fatigue results of the scarf adhesive joints (SAJs) fabricated using neat epoxy (NE), and SiC and Al 2 O 3 -nanocomposite adhesives were extensively analyzed regarding the effect of the adhesive materials, bond thickness (0.17 mm and 0.25 mm) on fatigue lives and dynamic behavior.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe potential energy was normalized by its initial value U p (0). It is obvious from Figure  20 (a) that the values of the normalized potential energy were increased with the increase of the stress level as a result of decreasing the storage modulus (E'). Khashaba et al.  16, 24  found that the U p has a linear inverse relationship with the E 0 . They have attributed the increase in U p and decrease of E 0 with \u03c3 max to the increase of thermal and mechanical interfacial damages in the SAJs. It is evident from Figure  20 (a) that Zhang model predicts well the experimental measurements of the U p , specially at higher stress levels (i.e., high damage) at which the normalized potential energy in stage II, follow a sigmoid curve with constant increasing rate during the most lifetime of the joint.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Blockchain technology as a secure and low-cost platform to track the billions of eventual transactions in a distributed energy economy has attracted the attention of experts in various fields of science. The current form of centralized energy trading system is still suffering from security concerns, quality of service, and to name a few. A decentralized energy system using blockchain technology allows the parties to create a trading energy transaction via microgrid. The blockchain technology offers the promise of an immutable, single source of truth from multiple sources without a third-party involvement. In this paper, we describe, explore and analyze the prominent implementation of blockchain technology in the energy sector. Furthermore, we analyze the security issues and highlight the performance of several attacks that might be occurred in the proposed system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt depends on the consensus protocol. The blocks are created and added to the blockchain differently. In proof of work, blocks are made by mining, which keeps the blockchain safe. A probability of finding nNonce of proof H for given target T is: \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b \u2264 \ud835\udc47) = \ud835\udc47 2 256 (1) The disadvantage of proof-work is related to efficiency, which wastes too many computational resources to find the target value (hash puzzle). The hash in PoW begins with several zero-bit hashes (SHA-256) and involves scanning for value when hashing data.\n\nB. RESILIENT OVERLAY NETWORK\nAn extensive distributed system is an overlay network that delivers content, applications, and services to a global audience  [22] . The chord algorithm in the overlay network provides a fast-distributed computation of hash function mapping keys to nodes responsible for them. It uses consistent hashing  [23] , which has several good properties. With high probability, when a \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\u210e node joins (or leaves) the network, only an O(1/N) fraction of the keys are moved to a different location.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe authors did not elaborate on the attacker's performance, such as selfish mining, eclipse attack, and double spending attack in the model. Imbault et al.  [9]  proposed the green blockchain concept for managing energy and exploring and creating a green certificate in an eco-district. There are no details \n\n45\nrelated to the security issues in this system. Recently, Danzi et al.  [10]  showed the concept of distributed proportional fairness control via a blockchain smart contract. The study aimed to enhance efficiency, especially regarding transmission losses in the smart grid.\n\nII. RESEARCH METHOD A. FUNDAMENTAL OF BLOCKCHAIN\nThe blockchain network can be described as a data structure used to create ledgers containing much transaction information  [11] -  [13] . As it has for centuries, commerce relies on trust and verified identity with cryptography protocol modules embedded in the system to ensure the credibility of the data and other security manners. As shown in Fig  2 , the timestamp is used in digital documents to prevent the attacker from tamperproofing it. The block in the blockchain is like a seal; if the attacker tries to break the seal, everyone is allowed to know the action.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis is the minimum necessary to maintain a balanced load  [24] . Fig.  3  shows a possible three-layered software structure for a cooperative mirror system. The highest layer would provide an interface to users, including naming.  From the client's side, there is a block, such as a file system, block store, and the chord itself. Block stores and chords are connected to another server and the client from the server. The primary usage of the chord protocol is a query value  [21]  from a client to find a successor (k). This refers to an O(N) query time, and the N refers to the number of rings applied. As shown in Fig 4 ., each node has a successor and a predecessor. The successor to a node is the next node in the identifier circle in a clockwise direction. The predecessor is counter-clockwise. However, typically, there are \"holes\" in the sequence (because of failure or departure).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

With the widespread availability of internet technology, the frequency of intelligent cyber-attacks in virtual cyber environments, such as APT attacks, continues to rise. Through an intelligent analysis of cyber threats which are still unknown, it is possible to prevent security accidents before they occur through the use of intelligent security analysis methods based on big data. The researcher conducted this empirical study concerning intelligent security analysis methods utilizing big data which are capable of preventing cyber threats, while protecting information assets from risks through evaluation and prediction. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition, such conventional technologies use integrated security management methods that manage the logs of security products on different models. In particular, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and anti-virus technologies are focused on the development of the platform technology needed to apply signature or blacklist-based detection methods to 10Gbp-level high-performance networks. Also, the changes in the key technologies to counter cyber-attacks were based on integrated security management technologies, and it is expected that an intelligent security analysis model using big data will be the prominent topic of the future. By seamlessly integrating security equipment that has previously been operated separately and managing them as a whole, it will be possible to conduct an intelligent analysis of security threats, which will allow us to predict future problems in parallel with behavior-based analysis, to prevent and remove security risks. Big data security analysis methods will allow the threats of attacks that have not been resolved to be addressed, utilizing the security system that will ensure seamless responses to the latest cyber-attacks. The correlation analysis of big data through these security systems will reveal the unknown patterns of the attacks and support decision-making. By implementing a high-performance pattern matching algorithm through the behavior-based signature database, it would be possible to make comparisons at a higher speed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nare not known in advance.

Intelligent Security Analysis Methods Using Big Data The existing technologies against cyber-attacks utilize network-based security devices such as an IDS (intrusion detection system) or IPS (intrusion prevention system), as well as the technologies that are designed to prevent information leakage from the inside, such as antivirus, database encryption, or other technologies to prevent information theft.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nRecent cyber-terrorist attacks go beyond a handful of hackers showing off their skills for the fun of it, and now pursue a range of ends including threatening national security, causing social unrest, and inflicting financial damages. For this reason, it is necessary to increase our awareness of security issues and how we respond to security breaches. In the future, various cyber-terror attack analyses and studies will be conducted to mitigate damages or prevent them from happening through intelligent security technologies. Embracing big data analysis technologies is one approach to realizing this goal. The information gathered from logs of attack events, which can then be analyzed to find correlations, can aid in detecting and preventing attacks before they occur. Also, to respond to an APT attack, the members of the organization must launch a systematic response. To accomplish this, rather than simply combining individual security solutions with different functions, an organization should implement an advanced, intelligent security solution which can be used to prevent and respond to an APT attack. As South Korean technologies lag behind the intelligent security analysis technologies of key overseas products, it is believed that research and development in intelligent security analysis technologies are urgently needed.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consider the first computing problem utilizing a minimum solution matrix. A convex infinite set is generated by a restricted number of closed intervals. Second, computing is an objective-domain nonlinear mathematical optimization problem. A multi-objective optimization problem is used to solve the second programming challenge. The constraint set must be used. Use discrete optimization techniques and branch-and-bound procedures for \u201cdigital integer linear programming\u201d. Our technique has been shown to be both practical and successful. The programming complexity increases as the organization expands. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA systems analyst must keep in mind that excessive energy output could harm the human body. Even still, Theorem 4 in Section 3) shows that there are no unique optimal solutions to Problem (3). X 1 (A, b) is an infinite set of optimum solution to Problem (3), sometimes known as X 1 (A, b). As a result, we use an unlimited set of X 1 (A, b) values to look for the most ideal solution, which employs a second optimization objective  (Shang et al., 2014) . In the above definition, optimizing the second objective given X 1 (A, b). Constraint reuse is a secondlevel issue. To increase non-operational base stations, we must reduce operational base stations. When base stations fail, their maintenance costs fall. The second goal is to reduce base station operating costs. While a non-functional base station has no electro-magnetic strength, a functional base station does. For instance, in order to keep the zero norm of the vector x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 . . .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAim 1 in Problems (3)-(  4 ) is to keep electromagnetic waves intensity as low as possible, whereas objective 2 is to keep base station operating expenses as low as possible. Problem (3) can be solved using the idea of a minimal solution matrix presented by Yang et al. While Yang's method fails to provide the whole solution set to the problem, this paper will prove that (3). We could not employ Yang's methods in the original study since it did not address the bi-level problem. This study seeks to discover the best possible solution to the problem stated above, which is bi-level objective programming (3), (4). The final section of Section 3 looks at the ideal solution set for Problem (3) and measures its quality by utilizing a minimum-maximum norm solution matrix. This chapter studies the problem at the second level (4). We use the set of minimum-norm solutions to solve the problem (4). We have included a mathematical example in Section 5 to show how and why our proposed method might be implemented and would produce accurate results. Section 4 discusses several forms of management requirements in order to highlight multiple kinds of bi-level difficulties.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAdditionally, system administrators may have additional requirements that must be taken into consideration when single-level optimization is employed.

Most of them usually assume homogeneous parameters with a specific Gaussian distribution for each domain, ignoring the robust testing of data skewness. This paper proposes to use unsupervised ensemble autoencoders connected to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to adapt to multiple domains regardless of the skewness of each domain. In the hidden space of the ensemble autoencoder, the attention-based latent representation and reconstructed features of the minimum error are utilized. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the sample density in the GMM. When the estimated sample density exceeds the learning threshold obtained in the training phase, the sample is identified as an outlier related to an attack anomaly. Finally, the ensemble autoencoder and the GMM are jointly optimized, which transforms the optimization of objective function into a Lagrangian dual problem. Experiments conducted on three public data sets validate that the performance of the proposed model is significantly competitive with the selected anomaly detection baselines. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRelated works are presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides detailed descriptions of the proposed framework, which includes parameter learning and the realization of a robust optimization model. The results of a series of experiments are reported in Section 4, followed by the conclusions drawn in Section 5.\n\nRelated work\nInternet attackers constantly improve their intrusion methods, resulting in the existence of various types of abnormal data in network traffic. It is therefore becoming increasingly urgent to devise effective approaches that are able to contend with increasingly complex cyberattacks  (Qian et al., 2019; Zong et al., 2018) . The existing library has documented many works with respect to anomaly detection, and the most popular method is the integration of autoencoders in a specific computing framework. Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network and are used in both feature engineering and anomaly detection. There are two major types of research on the applications of autoencoders in network intrusion anomaly detection. One type of research mainly uses the autoencoder and a variant of it that incorporates a deep network to recognize distributional heterogeneity by constantly learning and reconstructing normal and abnormal samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThey obtained domain-related models with adjustable budgets in terms of the number of parameters and computational complexity. To adjust the computational complexity of the network, they adopted a pretrained architecture to derive a specialized deep model for each domain and then incorporated a budget-aware adapter to select the most relevant feature channel to better process the data from the new domain. Among recent works, there are also some studies that improve domain adaptability through adversarial learning. They decompose a deep network into feature extractor and classifier components and then train each component by tuning its partner  (Xu, Chen, Zuo, Yan, & Lin, 2018) . They either use a deep cocktail network (DCTN) to deploy multidirectional adversarial learning to minimize the difference between the targets and multidomain data  (Ganin et al., 2016)  or use domain-specific representation learning  (Schoenauer-Sebag et al., 2019) , where the data come from similar but heterogeneous distributions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction\nCyberattacks have become a popular topic in recent years as an increasing number of terminal devices are connected to the Internet. They are highly threatening to the information security of individuals because of the large number of computer viruses spreading in the network, and various types of cyberattacks have emerged in endless streams. Examples of such attacks include disclosure, modification and deletion of specific data, attempts at unauthorized access, manipulation of information, and other malicious behaviors that make a system unreliable and unstable. This damage produces incalculable and disastrous consequences for users of the system  (Gong et al., 2019) . It is becoming increasingly important to secure users' data through the popularization of networking applications. However, it has always been difficult to develop an effective and compatible method for complex high-dimensional data  (Rezvy, Petridis, Lasebae, & Zebin, 2018) . With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, methods based on deep learning are envisioned as competent approaches for cyberattack detection.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n\nResults: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nspecificity (Sp), precision, accuracy (Acc) and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC): Sn \u00bc TP TP \u00fe FN Sp \u00bc TN TN \u00fe FP Precision \u00bc TP TP \u00fe FP Acc \u00bc TP \u00fe TN TP \u00fe TN \u00fe FP \u00fe FN MCC \u00bc TP \u00c2 TN \u00c0 FP \u00c2 FN ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u00f0TP \u00fe FP\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TP \u00fe FN\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TN \u00fe FP\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TN \u00fe FN\u00de p where TP, TN, FP and FN denote the numbers of true positives (correctly predicted cleavage sites), true negatives (correctly predicted 3 Results and discussion On the other hand, if the target dataset is large or the number of parameters is small,\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, we use grid search to adjust the DeepCleave hyperparameters. We utilize several strategies that are detailed below to prevent over-fitting into the training dataset. They include the use of ReLU activation function, L2 regularization, dropout  (Sainath et al., 2013)  and 'early stopping'  (Yao et al., 2007) . ReLU, which fixes the gradient disappearance problem in the backpropagation training algorithm, is defined as ReLU \u00bc 0 if x < 0 x else : L2 regularization imposes large penalties on sparse spiked weight vectors, preferring uniform parameters. This results in the neural nodes taking advantage of a larger number of the inputs coming from the upper network layer, rather than only a part of the input. After the L2 term is added, the absolute value of the weights tends to overall decrease, especially if there is no particularly large value, that is, the network tends to learn relatively small weights. Dropout refers to the random removal of some neurons ('erasure' of these neurons from the network) when training a large neural network.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nedu/ .

For each patient cohort, a decision analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions over a 5-year horizon. A Markov process was embedded in the decision model to simulate the possible prognosis of cancer. Data on transition probabilities, survival, side-effects, quality of life and costs were obtained from published sources and the SABR Commissioning through Evaluation (CtE) scheme. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with respect to quality-adjusted life-years. The robustness of the results was examined in a sensitivity analysis. Analyses were conducted from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective.\nResults\nIn the base case analysis, which assumed that all three interventions were associated with the same cancer progression rates and mortality rates, SABR was the most cost-effective intervention for both patient cohorts. This conclusion was sensitive to the cancer progression rate, mortality rate and cost of interventions. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probability that SABR is cost-effective was 57% and 50% in liver oligometastases and HCC, respectively.\nConclusions\nOur results indicate a potential for SABR to be cost-effective for patients with liver oligometastases and HCC. This finding supports further investigation in clinical trials directly comparing SABR with surgery and radiofrequency ablation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPatients accrued QALYs in each health state as the product of the quality of life tariff attached to the health state and the time spent in that health state. Each model was fully probabilistic; a distribution reflecting underlying uncertainty was specified for each parameter and a value for each parameter sampled from the respective distribution prior to evaluating each model. Mean costs and mean QALYs for each treatment strategy are reported after 5,000 simulations for each model. Details on the probabilistic analysis and the specification of distributions for each interval are provided in Appendix C. Cost-effectiveness is reported as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC)  [7] . The ICER is the ratio of the additional cost divided by the additional effectiveness of a treatment strategy compared to the next most effective strategy. Where one strategy is more effective and less costly than a comparator, the comparator is dominated. Where three strategies are compared, the strategy ranked in the middle for effectiveness may be less effective and more costly than some combination of the most and the least effective strategy. Such a strategy is extendedly dominated.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSuch a strategy is extendedly dominated. We excluded dominated and extendedly dominated strategies prior to calculating ICERs, as recommended  [7] . The CEAC is the plot of the likelihood an intervention is cost-effective as the value placed on the outcome is varied. We calculated the proportion of the 5,000 simulations for which each intervention had the highest net monetary benefit (NMB) across a range of values for a QALY from zero to \u00a350,000. The NMB is calculated by multiplying QALYs by the monetary value of a QALY and the subtracting the cost. The strategy with the highest NMB is the most costeffective at that value of a QALY. The CEAC captures the overall impact of sampling uncertainty; the impact changes as the value of a QALY varies.\n\nAdditional sensitivity analysis\nIn additional to the probabilistic analysis which captures the impact of joint uncertainty in model parameters, we undertook structural sensitivity analysis to test the impact of modelling assumptions. In the base case we assumed no difference in mortality or cancer progression rates according to treatment modality.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn structural sensitivity analysis we assumed that different treatment modality is associated with different mortality and/or different cancer progression rates. We also report one-way sensitivity analysis to quantify the robustness of results to variation in individual parameters.

Material and Methods The retrospective study comprised 127 pregnant women with various pregnancy complications between 23 and 39 gestational weeks. Umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms were recorded with Doppler ultrasound and characterized by pulsatility index (PI) and blood flow class (BFC). Doppler audio signals were stored on a digital video recorder and the sound frequency at the energy level 15 dB below its peak (MAXpeak-15 dB) was estimated off-line. The prediction of probability for composite adverse pregnancy outcome (operative delivery for fetal distress, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death) was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Results With increasing umbilical artery BFC, the MAXpeak-15 dB frequencies decreased (p < 0.0001) and the PI increased (p < 0.0001). The ROC AUCs for adverse outcome for MAXpeak-15 dB and for PI were 0.842 and 0.836 (p = 0.88), respectively. For the combination of MAXpeak-15 dB and PI, the corresponding AUC was 0.894, significantly higher than that of PI (p < 0.03) and of MAXpeak-15 dB (p < 0.05). Conclusion Umbilical artery Doppler sound spectrum analysis might be a useful supplement to PI in the clinical evaluation of fetoplacental circulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUse of stereo earphones also allows differentiation between positive and negative (reverse) signals by ear. After the advent of modern ultrasound techniques combining high-resolution imaging, color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler, listening to the signals has been generally abandoned in favor of adjusting the recording situation and optimizing signals by visual control of the Doppler spectrum. Indeed, modern ultrasound systems do not provide an output for audible signals anymore and the quality of built-in loudspeakers is usually very poor.   The evaluation of Doppler sound signals by ear is very subjective, highly dependent on the skills and experience of the operator. Consequently, the subjective method is not suitable for more general application. Therefore, we have developed an objective method of analyzing Doppler audio signals and we have identified a new parameter characterizing the sound signalthe maximum frequency at the energy level that is 15 dB below the peak (MAX peak-15 dB ). This new characteristic of the sound signal proved to correlate very well with the subjective classification by operator, both for computer-simulated sound frequencies  [22]  and for umbilical artery signals recorded from sheep fetuses under various degrees of experimental asphyxia  [9] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnalyses of the FFTs were done in the frequency range from 150 Hz, corresponding to the limit of earphones used by the sonographer, to 10,007 Hz, representing the frequency of the band stop of recording. An auditory feature, the high frequency cut-off band was identified within the frequency range  [14] . Based on the results of our previous experimental study  [9] , this high-frequency cut-off (MAX peak-15 dB ) was defined as the frequency band where the energy level had decreased by 15 dB from its maximum level, i. e. from the MAX peak value ( \u2022 \" Fig.  1 ). The primary outcome variable was the composite adverse pregnancy outcome including perinatal death, operative delivery for fetal distress and admission for treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit. The risk for a negative outcome, given a certain value for artery PI, auditory parameter MAX peak-15 dB, or combination of PI and MAX peak-15 dB , was calculated using logistic regression analysis.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn another textbook for midwives, the \"funic souffle\" is presented as a high-pitched sound synchronous with the fetal heart beats  [5] . The author commented that hearing the funic souffle during labor may be a sign of fetal distress caused by nipping or tightening of knots in the cord. In the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, the Doppler examinations of umbilical and uteroplacental circulation were performed blindly without support of two-dimensional (2 D) ultrasound images, using a stand-alone either continuous or pulsed Doppler velocimeter with a pen probe [1, 6 -8]. The umbilical artery velocity signals were captured by listening to the Doppler signal, while adjustments of the insonation angle were performed. According to our experience, a skilled sonographer can perceive various timbres in the Doppler audio signals and distinguish different types of umbilical artery blood flow in fetuses with similar PI. Recently, we have developed and validated in an animal experimental model a method for objective analysis of the Doppler sound spectrum  [9] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Its main function modules include SD (sales and distribution), MM (material management), PP (production planning), PM (factory maintenance), HR (human resources), and FICO (finance and cost) [citaton 7].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene product SAP regulates signals induced through the co-receptor SLAM \nAbstract: In addition to triggering the activation of B- or T-cell antigen receptors, the binding of a ligand to its receptor at the cell surface can sometimes determine the physiological outcome of interactions between antigen-presenting cells, T and B lymphocytes. The protein SLAM (also known as CDw150), which is present on the surface of B and T cells, forms such a receptor-ligand pair as it is a self-ligand. We now show that a T-cell-specific, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which contains an SH2 domain and a short tall, acts as an inhibitor by blocking recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to a docking site in the SLAM cytoplasmic region. The gene encoding SAP maps to the same area of the X chromosome as the locus for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and we found mutations in the SAP gene in three XLP patients. Absence of the inhibitor SAP in XLP patients affects T/B-cell interactions induced by SLAM, leading to an inability to control B-cell proliferation caused by Epstein-Barr virus infections. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBead-associated proteins were extracted and immunoblotted with streptavidin\u00b1HRP. d, Human PBL were activated with phytohaemagglutinin for 5 d. Cells were lysed (1 3 10 8 per ml) and immunoprecipitated with an anti-SLAM monoclonal antibody or with a control antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS\u00b1PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-SLAM serum (top) or with a rabbit anti-SAP antibody (bottom). A small amount of SAP mRNA detected in the small intestine probably resulted from lymphocyte contamination. In wild-type mice, SAP is expressed in T cells but not in B cells, whereas no mRNA or protein could be detected in CD3e null mice which lack T cells (C.W., J.S. and C.T., manuscript in preparation). Both human mRNA species encoding SAP (2.5 and 0.9 kilobases (kb)) (Fig.  3 ) were represented among the cDNA clones isolated in the two-hybrid system and encoded the same open reading frame, but differed in their 39 untranslated sequences.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRT-PCR products from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 60  healthy individuals contained two mRNA species (of 629 and 574 bp), as judged by PAGE and nucleotide-sequence analysis (Figs  4a, 5 ). These represented hSAP and E3D55 (hSAPD55 in Fig.  5a ) in which part of exon 3 had been deleted. The E3D55 coding sequence started at the beginning of exon 3 at nucleotide position 288 and ended at nucleotide 342 (Fig.  5a ). Because of a frameshift, the predicted protein sequence was identical to that of the \u00aerst two exons of SAP (amino acids 1\u00b167), followed by a nine-amino-acid sequence and a stop codon (Fig.  5b ). The results taken together indicate that the mRNAs of patient A1 had a deleted exon 2 or a deletion in exon 2 plus part of exon 3. These mutant forms derived from patient A1 were estimated to represent 90% of his SAP mRNA.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3a ). SAP was expressed in all major subsets of human T cells (CD4 + , CD45RO + , CD45RA + and CD8 + ) (Fig.  3c ), in the T-cell tumour cell line Jurkat, and in the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji which is positive in the Epstein\u00b1Barr virus (EBV).

However, the existing encryption methods cannot effectively solve the above problems when applied to WSN. To this end, according to WSN\u2019s characteristics and based on the identity-based encryption idea, an improved identity-based encryption algorithm (IIBE) is proposed, which can effectively simplify the key generation process, reduce the network traffic, and improve the network security. The design idea of this algorithm lies between the traditional public key encryption and identity-based public tweezers\u2019 encryption. Compared with the traditional public key encryption, the algorithm does not need a public key certificate and avoids the management of the certificate. Compared with identity-based public key encryption, the algorithm addresses the key escrow and key revocation problems. The results of the actual network distribution experiments demonstrate that IIBE has low energy consumption and high security, which are suitable for application in WSN with high requirements on security. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \ne parameter design of IIBE encryption algorithm is shown in Table  1  It can be seen from Table  2  that the key security of the proposed IIBE algorithm is the highest. en, compare the computational complexity of different algorithms, as shown in Table  3 . It can be seen from Table  3  that, compared with other algorithms, the computational complexity of the proposed IIBE algorithm in system initialization, helping device, and user key update is reduced from O (log N) to o (1), which means that the complexity of the proposed IIBE algorithm is the lowest.\n\nExperimental Results and Analysis\n4.1. Experimental Setup. In the experiment, the WSN node adopts CC2530 sensor network node of TI (Texas instruments) company  [30] , which has an enhanced C51 single chip microcomputer and 8k RAM storage space, and is powered by two No.5 batteries  [31, 32] . WSN nodes are shown in Figure  4 . e actual network topology of IIBE is shown in Figure  5 . Settings of WSN network parameters are shown in Table  4 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \ne calculation method of data reception rate  [33]  is as follows: Pr \ufffd \udbff\udf50 n i\ufffd0 n (i)receive \udbff\udf50 n i\ufffd0 n (i)send , ( 1 ) where n (i) receive represents the number of data received by the server from ith node and b represents the number of data sent by ith node. On CC2530 WSN node, the data receiving rates of several methods with 30-bit key are tested, and about 40,000 experimental data are obtained. e statistical fitting curve of the results is shown in Figure  7 . It can be seen from Figure  7  that when the network scale increases, the trend of traffic not only depends on the algorithm itself but also is greatly affected by the network layout.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNS2 simulation results show that this method is effective in preventing flooding attacks. However, this method only signs the data transmitted by nodes to prevent flooding attacks and has limited preventive effect on data eavesdropping attacks, so it needs to be combined with other encryption methods in practical applications. Rachkidy et al.  [23]  proposed a method of data storage combined with homomorphic encryption for some wireless sensor networks with insensitive real-time data, which is called DIOS. In some WSN (such as underwater sensor networks), people are more concerned about the whole data, rather than the data at a certain time. In view of this situation and considering that a large amount of data may cause loss to the sensor nodes if it is transmitted for a long time and a long distance, this literature puts forward that the data should be stored in a relay node in advance and preprocessed, so as to avoid the scattered and uninterrupted transmission of data. At the same time, homomorphic encryption is adopted to ensure security. is method is effective in some occasions, saving energy, and data can be stored safely. However, it is not suitable for most net-laying environments and has certain limitations.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

High-resolution radars (HRRs) utilize wideband signals and synthetic apertures to enhance the range and angular resolutions of tracking, respectively. They also generate one-, two-, and even threedimensional high-resolution images containing the feature information of targets, from which the targets can be precisely classified and identified. Advanced signal processing algorithms in HRRs obtain important information such as range-Doppler imaging, phase-derived ranging, and micro-motion features. However, the advantages and applications of HRRs are restricted by factors such as the reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-scatter point targets, decreased tracking accuracy of multi-scatter point targets, high demands of motion compensation, and low sensitivity of the target attitude. Focusing on these problems, this paper systematically introduces the novel technologies of HRRs and discusses the issues and solutions relevant to detection, tracking, imaging, and recognition. Finally, it reviews the latest progress and representative results of HRR-based research, and suggests the future development of HRRs. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA hierarchical recognition method handles different features by different classifiers. When designing classifiers at different levels, the classifier must be optimized by considering the physical meanings and statistical distributions of the features. For example, features such as target size and scattering center can be classified by a simple threshold discriminant classifier or a decision tree classifier, whereas the structural and statistical features of the scattering centers can be discriminated by a support vector machine classifier. Before making the final decision, the results of different classifiers can be combined by an ensemble classification method.  For adaptive feature extraction, we can exploit the end-to-end capability of deep neural networks. Deep learning avoids the high dependence of the traditional machine learning algorithm on human experience  [118] [119] [120] [121] . Deep neural networks include deep autoencoders, deep convolution neural networks, and deep recurrent neural networks. Among these, the deep convolution neural network is most commonly used. Figure  15  is a block diagram of HRRP recognition using a deep convolution neural network. The network includes a convolution layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe statistical features reflect the amplitude change information, and the structural features reflect the spatial distribution information of the scattering center. The transformation features are extracted by a specific transform of HRRP. The spectral and multi-scale features are obtained by a transform function (such as a Fourier or bispectrum transform) and a wavelet transform, respectively, and the subspace characteristics are formed by dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and local linear embedding. However, the traditional HRRP feature-extraction method requires advanced human experience, and a universal set of features is difficult to form. In specific applications, feature extraction and selection often consume much manpower and time, largely restricting the application of HRRP recognition. In multi-feature recognition, we need to select the appropriate feature subset and construct the corresponding classifier that recognizes different targets in different environments. If all features are fused blindly, the dimension of the feature vector will be greatly increased, which not only increases the computation effort and storage but may also reduce the recognition performance. Moreover, features differ in their physical meanings and usages. A hierarchical recognition method handles different features by different classifiers.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHow to assist the association by exploiting the target-feature information is essential for improving the target tracking performance  [85, 86] . Previous studies have incorporated the feature information into PMHT  [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . In some of these studies  [92] [93] [94] , the target is spatially expanded by the ellipsoid model and the tracking is assisted by the structural information of the target. The PMHT with classification measurements (PMHT-C) method assists the association using the target classification features within the PMHT framework  [95, 96] . The attribute measurements and targets are related through a matrix that is independent of time and observations. The method improves the correlation performance when the motion states are blurred. However, the matrix correlating the measured attributes and target features may change in practice. For example, the observed number of scattering points is not only affected by false alarm detections and fluctuations but also depends on the target attitude. The PMHT-C algorithm cannot cope with switching of the target-feature states, and its performance degrades in this circumstance.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The high-quality image transmission in visual sensor networks (VSNs) consumes more space, energy, transmission delay which may experience the various security threats. Image compression is a key phase of visual sensing systems that needs to be effective. This motivates us to propose a fast and efficient intelligent image transmission module to achieve the energy-efficiency, minimum delay, and bandwidth utilization. Compressive sensing (CS) introduced to speedily compressed the image to reduces the consumption of energy, time minimization, and efficient bandwidth utilization. However, CS cannot achieve security against the different kinds of threats. Several methods introduced since the last decade to address the security challenges in the CS domain, but efficiency is a key requirement considering the intelligent manufacturing of VSNs. Furthermore, the random variables selected for the CS having the problem of recovering the image quality due to the accumulation of noise. Thus concerning the above challenges, this paper introduced a novel one-way image transmission module in multiple input multiple output that provides secure and energy-efficient with the CS model. The secured transmission in the CS domain proposed using the security matrix which is called a compressed secured matrix and perfect reconstruction with the random matrix measurement in the CS. Experimental results outwards that the intelligent module provides energy-efficient, secured transmission with low computational time as well as a reduced bit error rate. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n4 . Step 2 Selection of random matrix For the selection of the random variables regression principles carried out for the input images, a random matrix carried out by the random variable regression principles for the six input images.

This process carried by the BPSK modulation scheme evaluating with two users, considering users at a time. When the above signals are transmitted through the channel, the added white Gaussian noise incorporated. After the addition of those noises, the signals are altered. Hence to recover that the reconstruction process is carried out that can be explained by the following stages. Step 5 Reconstruction of compressed security After the addition of AWGN in the radio communication channel, the estimation of the BER carried out to recover the original signal encoded by the Manchester coding. The clock recovery of Manchester used to decode the original signal.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2017; Song et al. 2019; Hassen 2008; Al-Hayani and Ilhan 2020a, b; Singh et al. 2016; Ur Rehman et al. 2016) . The method for separable data hiding in encrypted images utilizing CS and discrete Fourier transform proposed in  Ahmad et al. (2017) . As indicated by that strategy, CS utilized just to pack and encode the parts containing the mystery message in the wake of hiding the secret message. The measurement number for CS reconstruction diminishes monotonically with the reduction of overhead rate. To keep the image not extraordinarily augmented, the overhead rate must be a little esteem. In this way, with the reduction of the number for CS reconstruction, it is not conceivable to correct inserted data and recover a unique image. Another technique of an orthogonal matrix using the Gram Schmidt calculation proposed in  Song et al. (2019) . During the time spent block-wise temporary change, the calculated guide was utilized trailed by the dissemination procedure. The method explains in performs encryption and decryption utilizing the symmetric key, i.e.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe intelligent selection of random variables by the prediction and integrality property of the regression principle reconstructs the image accurately in the reconstruction phase. Transmission of signals in the MIMO channel by the full-duplex channel access and the utilization of the BPSK modulation scheme with Manchester coding helps to recover the signals after the transmission through the Rayleigh fading channel even with the addition of AWGN. Due to the combined module, the additional computation time required for secondary processes neglected and hence increasing the speed of the transmission. The image becomes more compatible with the channel bandwidth and transmits securely with minimum computation time by the compressed security matrix.\n\nResults and discussion\nTo present the effectiveness of the proposed module regarding energy efficiency, time-consuming, and security, the simulation is carried out in MATLAB using the images of the digital image processing book.

In addition, the quiesical issue for additional time of pressure is that the auxiliary interaction of pressure occurs through the dewar receiving extra time. To address these issues, compressed sensing emerges, which packs the image into hours of sensing, is generated in an expedient manner that reduces time usage and saves the use of data transfer capability, however Bomb in transmission. A variety of examinations cleared a way for dealing with security issues in compressive sensing (CS) through giving security as an alternative negotiation. In addition, univariate factors opted for CS as the issue of rearranging image quality is because of the aggregation of clutter. Along these lines related to the above issues, this paper proposed two-way image transmission to the Corvus Coron module, which presents an energy-effective with the CS model, as an inbuilt interaction in the CS transmission through the security framework.

Moreover, Quizzical the problem for the additional time under compression results that, the secondary process of the compression followed through the acquisition consumes more time.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nHence, for resolving these issues, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged, which compressed the image at the time of sensing emerges as a speedy manner that reduces the time consumption and saves bandwidth utilization but fails under secured transmission. Several kinds of research paved path to resolve the security problems under CS through providing security such as the secondary process.\nFindings\nThus, concerning the above issues, this paper proposed the Corvus corone module two-way image transmission that provides energy efficiency along CS model, secured transmission through a matrix of security under CS such as inbuilt method, which was named as compressed secured matrix and faultless reconstruction along that of eminent random matrix counting under CS.\nOriginality/value\nExperimental outputs shows intelligent module gives energy efficient, secured transmission along lower computational timing also decreased bit error rate. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nDegree of compression, distortion size, when images are downloaded from the web  (Mahesh et al., 2016; Stolfo, 1997; Talukder and Harada, 2010) , are some of the aspects to note. Compression leads to deterioration of the image content, so pre-processing approaches such as optimization, segmentation and representation need to be Two-way image transmission performed to address these consistency-based issues  (Oh and Lei, 2012) . Once preprocessed, the image gets formatted through various techniques, resulting under digital form. These digital signals consume large space and more time when it moves through a wireless channel  (Yang et al., 2016) . The following Figure  1  shows the image transmission process through the channel. The prepared sign should be reformatted during image handling to get the first transmitted image, yet this sign will likewise give repetitive data  (Manapragada and Kluesing, 2014) . It is additionally imperative to give an appropriate pressure procedure to take out such repetitive information  (Qaisar et al., 2013) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe savvy module would likewise diminish the requirement for new sifting techniques, which ingest additional time, here.

As exhibited through that framework, CS used just to pack and encode the parts containing the puzzle message under the wake of hiding the mystery message. The estimation number for CS entertainment decreases monotonically along the decrease of weight rate. To keep the picture not sensationally expanded, the weight rate must be a little respect. Under this manner, along the diminishing of the estimation number for CS diversion, it is unimaginable to totally address implanted data and recoup exceptional picture.

Henceforth, to defeat as a joined hotspot for securing, pressure and change, the idea of CS is used through their inclination of dimensional decrease and arbitrary projection, which detected itself and diminishes the data transmission use. This module performs less data transfer capacity use through quantization along choosing the irregular variable under the spatial space as a regularized structure using least squares models and uncovers a considerable sum about the conduct of the estimators under de-quantization. Along this, confusion and scattering of a pandemonium property under a fiddling ringer is used as an arranging condition under quantization, which has the distinguishing strength of seeing just to those unmistakable along the language of the imps so the picture bits cannot be appreciated through figure aggressors, therefore, gives high security to the picture bits.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nwhere \u03b7 is the lower bound of the adjacency matrix element; \u03bb max j (k) and \u03bb min j (k) are defined as \u03bb max j (k) = max{\u03bb l (k)|\u2200l \u2208 N - j }, \u03bb min j (k) = min{\u03bb l (k)|\u2200l \u2208 N - j }, and D max j (k) D min j (k) are defined as D max j (k) = {l|\u03bb l (k) = \u03bb max j (k)}, D min j (k) = {l|\u03bb l (k) = \u03bb min j (k)}.

Whether artificial intelligence can be successfully applied to the field of credibility, including several measurable factors, such as adaptability, interpretability and the feasibility of algorithm training Enforceability  [6] -  [10] . The traditional physical systems (such as industrial control systems, drive systems, and medical devices) are relatively difficult to access, penetrate, and enforce attacks by the attackers because of their relatively isolated operating environment and the use of dedicated channels for communication. Due to the need of informatization and intelligence, the traditional physical systems have gradually evolved into CPS, and the operating environment of the system has been opened and interconnected through closure and isolation  [11] -  [13] . While improving operational efficiency, it also provides new attack channels for the attackers, making CPS more vulnerable to internal or external attacks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe total number of offensive and defensive resources S A and S D are two key factors affecting the level of system vulnerability during the game phase.

The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach. The experimental results confirm the fact that the proposed model performs better than the existing machine learning models. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nLife without internet has almost become impossible in the present day and age. The potential of internet is enormous and its growth has been reflected in the functioning of business models pertaining to education, entertainment, healthcare and all the various types of organizations around the world. However, use of internet in every sphere of human life has its own challenges. The most significant challenge deals with data security. Network intrusion is a situation of security breach due to unauthorized access in a computational network. The process of identifying the different types of intrusions in a network is performed by an intrusion detection system (IDS)  [1] . The attacks in the IDS can be categorized as Probe attack, DoS attack, R2L attack, U2R attack. In probe attack, the unauthorized personnel 'sniffs' the network and identifies the vulnerabilities of a particular target resource. As an example, the attacker can use an uncommon port number as the identification with other IP addresses to attack on different ports. The DoS attacks are targeted to make the network resources unavailable by flooding unnecessary data packets by the attacker.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSuch abnormalities are recorded as logs in the IDS servers to prevent similar attacks on the network perimeter. The host IDS, on the contrary, is deployed on each individual host and the incoming and outgoing network traffic is monitored for abnormalities  [3] [4] [5] . The existing data is compared with the previous data log and any discrepancies detected are reported to the administrator. IDS systems can be hardware as well as software oriented wherein the software based IDS is far more convenient and configurable than the hardware based IDS, which faces issues in handling data traffic requiring rigorous maintenance tasks. In spite of such issues research on hardware based IDS has gained immense momentum for the detection of attacks. The emphasis hence has been more on the performance of advanced graphics processors, which provide higher performance in the detection of attacks using hardware based IDS. Since any network is extremely vulnerable to such attacks, organizations need to have efficient defensive mechanisms installed and deployed to identify the maximum possible threats. NIDS and HIDS sensors are resource expensive and impractical to be deployed covering the entire network. Inability to strategically optimize the usage of IDS could lead to important resources being exposed to adversarial attacks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe performance of the proposed model is then evaluated with existing algorithms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work, Section 3 discusses briefly the background algorithms used in this work, Section 4 discribes the proposed methodology, Section 5 highlights the results of exprimentation and Section 6 incorporates the conclusion and points out the direction of future works.\n\nRelated Work\nIntrusion detection is a major task of any network security tool. The various intrusion detection and prevention systems deployed in networks have associated performance and efficiency issues. The performance of the IDS depends on its accuracy in detecting network anomalies with decreased number of false positive alarms being generated. Various researchers have worked to resolve such performance issues by implementing various machine learning approaches on IDS datasets  [6] . Support vector machines (SVM), multi-layer perceptron network and various other ML techniques have been used, each with limitations pertinent to the handling of large network datasets. Researchers have proposed the use of classification techniques to eradicate such accuracy and performance issues in the prediction of malicious network activities.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The stable growth of migrant children, which affects the sustainable stability of the community, is adversely impacted by sustained pressures without adequate assistance and advice. Therefore, psychological stress from each post on microblog has been established through research focused on detecting migrant children. Nevertheless, after stressful times, it is more important to consider stress from aspect to recognize stressful periods and stressful incidents that cause each stressful period. This paper identifies the problem of the recognition of migrant children in the open social network microblog stressful periods and stressor events. Besides, the improved Poisson-dependent probability model has been developed and focused on the study of the postings of migrant children during stressful activities in schools to compare stressors with a set of postings on Tencent Weibo (microblog). Through this model the average stressed times of migrant children which obtains more information regarding potential stressors affecting stressed periods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMigrant children are now a core tool for the Chinese urban social community. Effective incorporation into urban schools of migrant children is the prerequisite for well-being, financial prosperity, and social stability. However, the dual household registration (hukou) (or ruralurban stratification system) that prevents equitable access to public facilities, including schooling for migrant children  (Liu 2013) , is among the most compelling structural barriers to integration. There are many drawbacks for students at a traditional migrant school in the residential region of a communityincluding a shortage of teaching positions  (Shakeel and Baskar 2020) , outdated infrastructure for schooling and inadequate instructional content and equipment. Migrant children are more likely to live in distress relative to the metropolitan equivalent, undergo psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, endure discrimination and victimization and report crime  (Joshi et al. 2019) . Besides economic drawbacks, the acculturation and well-being of migrant children are further constrained by a lack of cultural resources and social isolation in the region (Fig.  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe therapy party worked for 1 h a week and completed 10 min of daily assignments for 8 weeks. A better understanding of the feeling correlated with stress may improve the coping ability according to studies of attention training. Even though the growing perception of stressors itself may raise stress as part of the cycle of awareness of cognitive, emotional of social development. It could be necessary to increase stress. The analysis of potential effects on later behavior and neurobiology of early life stress (ERS) in humans is a fast increasing field. Although epidemiologic and neurobiological research offer a dark image of adverse outcomes the scope of the findings surrounding potential emotional and cognitive deficiencies correlated with ELS has not been incorporated. Emerging results of experimental research exploring brain developmental processes in healthy populations will offer a new basis for the understanding of ELS-based sequels  (Pechtel and Pizzagalli 2011) . The goal is to increase this analysis based on the effects of clinical research on normative brain growth which are outlined. Second, this control brain structure system was used to explain shifts in the developmental path of ELS cognitive and affective deficits.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe underlying Poisson dependent probability model, together with the event-oriented approach indicated by this paper, attempts at predicting the psychological traumatic periods of Although the simple truth includes activities linked to school life, it disregards the observed maximum stress periods which are not traumatic in the context of school nature. The typical stressful identification efficiency under different trust levels as seen in Fig.  6 . In comparison, the sensitivity improves considerably with the threshold value. It examines the predictive model by discriminating between stressful and stable post-stress rates. Another significant point is that the precision rate is smaller than the recall rate. It is the different test events which can be contained in the basic truth. Yet there are often other difficult times, such as \"So much homework\" in school life, which normally give school students a lot of homework before an exam. Although such occasions do not occur in the truth of the fields, they are considered as incorrect findings that affect detection precision. The findings of the identification of stressors indicate a similar effect to that of stressful times, as seen in Fig.  7 .

Firstly, the facial expression image is normalized, and the edge of each layer of the image is extracted in the convolution process. The extracted edge information is superimposed on each feature image to preserve the edge structure information of the texture image. Then, the dimensionality reduction of the extracted implicit features is processed by the maximum pooling method. Finally, the expression of the test sample image is classified and recognized by using a Softmax classifier. To verify the robustness of this method for facial expression recognition under a complex background, a simulation experiment is designed by scientifically mixing the Fer-2013 facial expression database with the LFW data set. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average recognition rate of 88.56% with fewer iterations, and the training speed on the training set is about 1.5 times faster than that on the contrast algorithm. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUnder the trend of artificial intelligence, the communication between human and computer becomes easier and easier.

The possibility of severe vision loss can be extensively reduced by timely diagnosis and treatment. An automated screening for DR has been identified as an effective method for early DR detection, which can decrease the workload associated to manual grading as well as save diagnosis costs and time. Several studies have been carried out to develop automated detection and classification models for DR. This paper presents a new IoT and cloud-based deep learning for healthcare diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The proposed model incorporates different processes namely data collection, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. At first, the IoT-based data collection process takes place where the patient wears a head mounted camera to capture the retinal fundus image and send to cloud server. Then, the contrast level of the input DR image gets increased in the preprocessing stage using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) model. Next, the preprocessed image is segmented using Adaptive Spatial Kernel distance measure-based Fuzzy C-Means clustering (ASKFCM) model. Afterwards, deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based Inception v4 model is applied as a feature extractor and the resulting feature vectors undergo classification in line with the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model. The proposed model was tested using a benchmark DR MESSIDOR image dataset and the obtained results showcased superior performance of the proposed model over other such models compared in the study. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSeveral DLbased techniques are designed to examine the retinal fundus images and to develop automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models for DR  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . A novel technology was designed in the literature  [8]  to determine the disease intensity under cloud and IoT applications. This technique was applied to predict the seriousness of the illness. The above technology was deployed to take unique care of student's and children's health. In this study, a programmatic health information, termed as student data, was created with the help of reputed UCI Repository as well as sensors employed in medical domain. This was deployed also to forecast diverse ailments which have been influenced by student with severity. Followed by, several other classification models were applied to predict different types of diseases. The major application of this algorithm is the determination of prediction accuracy using few attributes like F-measure, specificity as well as sensitivity. Consequently, it is evident that the presented technique outperformed with respect to prediction accuracy when compared with previous methodologies.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nKakria et al.  [18]  employed a novel online health care observation technology to monitor the remote heart patients often using mobile phones and wearable sensors. Subsequently, Kim et al.  [19]  established a technique to monitor the emergency scenario under the application of content of motion tracking disease patients. Some other models are also found in Jebaseeli et al.  [20] . Roychowdhury et al.  [21]  developed a new DREAM: Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Using Machine Learning model which investigates the fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view. The severity level of DR can be generated by the use of ML models such as Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost. Among the classifiers, GMM and kNN are found to be effective while classifying bright and red lesions respectively. Adal et al.  [22]  has developed a robust and flexible method to automatically detect the longitudinal retinal modifications because of small red lesions through the utilization of the normalized fundus images. It reduces the illumination differences and enhances the contrast level of small retinal features.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHence, the variables associated with these normal distributions could be derived using, m X l jC\u00bcc \u00bc 1 N c X N c l\u00bc1 x l (21) s 2 X l jC\u00bcc \u00bc 1 N c X N c l\u00bc1 x l 2 \u00c0m 2 (22) where N c denotes the count of instance where C \u00bc c whereas N represents the number of overall examples applied in training.

To address these problems, we propose a new and robust Local Adjacent Extrema Pattern (LAEP) is a feature descriptor for fingerprint classification. The proposed descriptor finds it values based on indexes of local adjacent extremas using first order derivatives. The intensity values of the local extremas are compared with center pixel intensity value to employ the correlation of central pixel with its neighbors. Finally, the descriptor is generated on the support of the indexes and local extremas values. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for classification of fingerprint images into five classes. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor, we have tested on Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) - Indian rural fingerprint database for classification. In addition, the classification results of the proposed descriptor are compared with the existing methods. The resultant LAEP descriptor proved better classification accuracy than the previous methods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt helps to illustrate the local feature of the image. Various LBP are exist in the literature such as a Local Ternary Pattern (LTP)  [12] , Center Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CSLBP)  [13] , Data Driven Local Binary Pattern (DDLBP)  [14] , Local Neighboring Intensity Relationship Pattern (LNIRP)  [15] , Local Diagonal Extrema Pattern (LDEP)  [16] , Multichannel Decoded Local Binary Patterns (MDLBP), Directional Extrema Pattern (DEP)  [17] , Local Ternary Co -Occurrence Patterns (LTCoP)  [18]  etc. Burges  [19]  introduced the concepts on support vector machine for pattern recognition. Object recognition, face recognition and text categorization are worked with the help of learning methodology such as SVMs in pattern recognition. Fingerprint matching using SVM-based similarity measure was introduced by Fei et al  [20] . The classification is challenging task because it used to reduce the search time of automatic fingerprint matching in large database as a preliminary stage.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo facilitate high performance classification, in this paper, we used only adjacent neighbours because it reduces the dimension of the descriptor and contain most of the local edge information. The remaining sections of this research paper include, section 2 proposes a descriptor based fingerprint classification model using local adjacent extrema pattern. Section 3 describes about SVM. Section 4 presents classification results and performance analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\n\nLocal Adjacent Extrema Pattern\nLocal adjacent extrema pattern has derived as a new feature descriptor for fingerprint classification form center pixel and its local neighbours. The first order local adjacent derivative is used to extract the local adjacent extrema (maxima and minima) pattern. The connection of local adjacent extrema with the center pixel plays a major role to encode the LAEP descriptor. Local adjacent extrema are extracted of any center pixel by using first order local adjacent derivatives.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction\nTo distinguish the human biometric security is known by two ways such as physical attributes and behavior. There have been different biometric traits were used for recognition. The biometric traits, for example: fingerprint, palm veins, iris recognition, retina, face recognition, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), palm print, hand geometry, odor, typing rhythm, gait, and voice which is very appropriate for human recognition because of their singularity, integrality and uniformity. Among all other biometric techniques, fingerprints have the elevated amount of dependability and widely utilized by criminological specialists as a part of criminal examinations. To maintain the security is computationally challenging task for large database. Hence, fingerprint indexing scheme is needed for match the query image against every one of the fingerprints in database. Fingerprints are classified into pre specified categories using fingerprint classification algorithms which give an indexing scheme to encourage proficient coordinating for large fingerprint database. To obtain the index, the following fingerprint features such as incipient ridges, minutiae, pores, singular points, ridge orientation map, singular points, dots and frequency map are used for recognition to identify the person.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

An energy efficient clustering method, depending on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the Fractional Artificial Bee Colony (FABC) algorithm, has a propensity to maximize the energy of the network and life time of nodes by the optimal cluster head selection (CHS). When conveying data, an ABC-Dynamic Scout bee algorithm is presented that multiplies the scout bee production to enlarge the number of alive nodes and the of CH energy. An assessment among the performances of the implemented ABC-based Dynamic Scout bee algorithm routing mechanism in opposition to that of ABC-based CHS and FABC-based CHS routing is done. The experimental outcome demonstrates that the implemented method increases the quantity of alive nodes with 25% of maximum energy for the normalized network compared with conventional protocols. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSimilarly, from Table  4 , the alive node for limit 1 in the 0th and 100th iteration is 1% better than those for the 200th, 400th, and 600th iterations.

Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs technological solutions contributing to the development of a sustainable environment may allow progressive socioeconomic changes for environmental sustainability  (Cazorla-Montero et al., 2019; Bazan-Krzywosza\u0144ska et al., 2019) . These traditionally established technical approaches for water management and sustainable practice often reflect standard water governance  (How et al., 2020) . The Sustainability Index (SI) analyses the efficiency of different water policies and the environment and the system's capacity to reduce its vulnerability using artificial intelligent techniques  (Prabakaran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) . The index shows that the system has a higher adaptive capacity for a suggested policy that makes the system more ecological effective  (Goralski and Tan, 2020) . The sustainability index integrates performance standards that capture the basin's important and long-awaited sustainabilities  (Cernev and Fenner, 2020)  for environment management using AI  (Zhang et al., 2019) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAccordingly, the dedication to water management supply and demand has been alleviated, and significant increases in local economic performance have been simulated with observed effects.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNone.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 and Section 2 discussed the introduction and related works on sustainable development of water environment based on ecological engineering intelligent planning. In Section 3, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed. In Section 4, the numerical results have been analyzed, and the consistency of the data is evaluated. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research paper with a future perspective.\n\nRelated works\nAjay Gajanan Bhave et al.  (Fritz et al., 2019)  introduced the Decision-Making Under uncertainty (DMUU) approach for water resource planning. A water supply model is satisfactorily optimized and validated with the observed streamflow. In model simulations, almost all conditions increased the potential to meet such performance metrics without adaptation. The change options partly compensate for the effects of change, and the sequence of choices in adaptation processes according to stakeholder priorities impacts metric fulfillment. Early emphasis on agricultural demand control increases robustness and trade-offs between intra-basin water quality and basin-wide water availability. They prove that the best balance between demand and water supply is prone to future uncertainty and changes. Qiang  Wang et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In particular, many remarkable inequalities and monotonicity properties for these functions can be found in the literature [\uf63a-\uf6dc\uf640].\n\nExcerpt 2: \n\uf63e ) given in [\uf63a\uf639]. The main purpose of this paper is to present the best possible parameter a \u2208 (\uf6dc/\uf6dc\uf63d, \u221e) such that the functions \u03c8 (x + \uf6dc) -L x (x, a) and \u03c8 (x + \uf6dc) -L xx (x, a) are strictly increasing or decreasing with respect to x \u2208 (\uf639, \u221e), and establish several new sharp bounds for the psi function and its derivatives. All numerical computations are carried out using the MATHEMATICA software.\n\nLemmas\nIn order to prove our main results we need several lemmas, which we present in this section.\n\nLemma \uf63a.\uf6dc (see [\uf6dc\uf641]\n) Let L(x, a) be defined on (\uf639, \u221e) \u00d7 (\uf6dc/\uf6dc\uf63d, \u221e) by (\uf6dc.\uf6dc). Then the following statements are true: (i) the functions a \u2192 \u2202L(x, a)/\u2202x is strictly decreasing, a \u2192 \u2202 \uf63a L(x,\n\nExcerpt 3: \n. . ; (ii) F a (x) is strictly increasing with respect to x on (\uf639, \u221e) if and only if a \u2264 a \uf63b .

To decrease the time cost in manual work, text classification techniques are applied to automatically identify severity of bug reports. In this paper, we address the problem of low-quality and class imbalance for identifying the severity of bug reports. First, we combine feature selection with instance selection to simultaneously reduce the bug report dimension and the word dimension, which could get small-scale and high-quality reduced data set. Then, an improve random oversampling technique, named, RSMOTE, which is presented to weaken the imbalancedness degree of class distribution. Finally, to avoid the random over-sampling uncertainty of RSMOTE, we develop an ensemble learning algorithm, which is based on Choquet fuzzy integral, to combine multiple RSMOTE. We empirically investigate the performance of data reduction on ten data sets of three large open source projects, namely, Eclipse, Mozilla, and GNOME. The results show that our approach can effectively reduce the data scale and improve the performance of identifying the severity of bug reports. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the following, we will present some related definitions. Definition 1: Given E = {E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E L }, La = {La 1 , La 2 , . . . , La C }, and Te = {x|x \u2208 R m }, for each x \u2208 Te, the decision profile matrix is shown as follows: DP (x) = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8f0 e 11 (x) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 e 1j (x) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 e 1C (x) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . e i1 (x) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 e ij (x) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 e iC (x) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFurthermore, different variants have significantly different performance of identifying the severity bug reports. For example, RSMOTE+J48, CMA+(NB or J48), and ROS+J48 are the top-3 best performing variants for identifying the severity of bug reports for DS-M6. RSMOTE+KNN, CMA+KNN, and Original+NBM are the top-3 best performing variants for identifying the severity of bug reports for DS-G8. From these results, we observe that in most cases, the classifiers achieved higher performance with RSMOTE than with the other ILS (RUS, ROS, SMOTE, and CMA). Therefore, RSMOTE approach could effectively improve the performance of identifying surprise bug reports of camel and wicket. RQ4. Can combine RSMOTE with data reduction could improve the performance of identifying the severity of bug reports. Due to original dataset are imbalance distribution, which could affect the basic classification performance of identifying the severity of bug reports. Based on RQ3, we can get that RSMOTE approach has better generalization capabilities than ILS (SMOTE, RUS, CMA and ROS).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBesides feature selection in defect prediction. Kim et al.  [36]  introduced an approach to measure the noise resistance in defect prediction and how to detect noise data. Xu  [27]  uses seven approaches to reduce the dimension of dataset, which could improve the performance of classification results. Yang et al.  [29]  uses three commonly feature selection, IG, CHI, Correlation Coefficient to reduce the noise from 4 opensource components from Eclipse and Mozilla.  Zhang [3958]  represents a concept profile-based approach to assign the severity of bug reports. They build the concept profiles based on historical bug reports. Then, the new bug reports come, they assign the severity of new coming bug report by measuring the similarity and severity concepts.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn the context of software maintenance, a bug with high severity is typically associated with fatal errors and crashes. Therefore, the automatic prediction of the severity of bug reports could considerably reduce manpower requirements and improve the efficiency of bug resolution.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this work, we present a cost-effective route to synthesize the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite by using cheap metal hydrides and aluminum chloride as starting reagents and to achieve liquid state reactive milling. The LiH/AlCl3 and MgH2/AlCl3 reaction systems were systemically explored. The phase identification of the obtained products was carried out by XRD and the morphology observed by TEM characterization. It was found that the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite can be successfully synthesized by reactive milling of commercial AlCl3 and LiH in a neutral ionic liquid ([2-Eim] OAc). Based on XRD analysis and TEM observation, an average grain size of 56 nm can be obtained by the proposed mechanochemical process. By setting the isothermal dehydrogenation temperature between 80 and 160 \u00b0C, the as-synthesized \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite exhibits an advantage in hydrogen desorption capacity and has fast dehydriding kinetics. The hydrogen desorption content of 9.93 wt% was achieved at 160 \u00b0C, which indicates the potential utilization of the prepared nanocomposite in hydrogen storage applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHowever, it has been reported that the metallic Al forms during the room temperature ball milling, which can be partially attributed to the heterogeneity of solid-state reaction and leads to the decomposition of AlH 3 . Though the cryo-milling process has the potential to prevent the AlH 3 from dehydriding, the much lower temperature also raises technical challenges on large-scale production of \u03b1-AlH 3 . Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as promising environmentfriendly solvents in organic synthesis and offer distinct advantages, such as non-flammability, low volatility, low toxicity and high thermal and chemical stability. 32, 33 ILs are also extremely important because they can be used as a solvent in catalyst-free reactions. To date, series of catalyst-free reactions are employed and completed in ILs due to the ease of the experimental procedure, low cost and eco-friendly process. 34, 35 Due to the advantages offered by ILs over traditional approaches, we aimed to employ ILs solvent to synthesize \u03b1-AlH 3 . In order to stabilize the obtained \u03b1-AlH 3 during the mechanochemical process, the selection of ionic liquid is critical.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, the successful synthesis of \u03b3-AlH 3 /MgCl 2 nano-composite has been demonstrated by solid-state milling of nanocrystalline MgH 2 and AlCl 3 , which is also a cost-effective method to obtain \u03b3-AlH 3 nano-composite.  [37] [38] [39] [40]  However, the formation of \u03b1 phase has not been demonstrated by above reports mentioned. Based on the previous investigation, the MgH 2 /AlCl 3 and LiH/AlCl 3 as the reaction systems are employed and introduced into ILs to synthesize \u03b1-AlH 3 . Fig.  1  shows the XRD patterns of the MgH 2 and AlCl 3 , with a ratio of 3:2, milled in [2-Eim] OAc for different time intervals. As suggested by the XRD patterns, an amorphous-like background between 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 can ascribe to the [2-Eim] OAc, which was used as a solvent in the mechanochemical synthesis of AlH 3 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nCompared with acidic ionic liquids, the neutral ILs are more suitable for synthesis of \u03b1-AlH 3 because the protonic acid is eliminated and the mechanochemical reaction can be performed at a lower temperature under neutral conditions. To overcome the heterogeneity of the solid state reaction and stabilize the synthesized \u03b1-AlH 3 during the mechanochemical process, the [2-Eim] OAc ionic liquid has been induced as the efficient neutral media. Enormous interest in \u03b1-AlH 3 has urged us to explore green and straightforward mechanochemical route. Herein, we propose a sustainable and green synthesis process for \u03b1-AlH 3 by employing liquid state reaction milling process and using cheap metal hydrides and aluminum chloride as reagents. In the present investigation, the LiH/AlCl 3 and MgH 2 /AlCl 3 are considered as the reaction system, separately. The [2-Eim] OAc (2-ethyl imidazolium acetate) is used as an efficient neutral media ionic liquid for \u03b1-AlH 3 synthesis. The proposed synthesis approach is more sustainable, convenient and eco-friendly than the previously reported methods.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In present work, a convenient and cost-efficient solid-state mechanochemical reaction is proposed to obtain \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite. With the addition of TiF3, \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite was formed in a short period by milling of LiH and AlCl3. Based on XRD and NMR results, the average grain size of the \u03b1-AlH3 in the nano-composite was 45\u2009nm. The reaction pathway as well as the synergistic effect of TiF3 on the solid state reaction between LiH and AlCl3 were confirmed. In the \u03b1-AlH3/LiCl nano-composite, TiF3 reduced the temperature of dehydriding reaction and improved dehydrogenation rate of \u03b1-AlH3. Within the temperature range between 80 and 160\u2009\u00b0C, dehydrogenation of the as-milled \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite showed fast kinetics. At 160\u2009\u00b0C, a maximum hydrogen desorption of 9.92\u2009wt% was obtained within 750\u2009s, very close to the theoretical hydrogen capacity of \u03b1-AlH3. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHowever, the coordinated Al species in Li-Al-H is different from that in Al-H. Grubisic demonstrated that for the other aluminum hydride clusters such as Al x H x+2 (3 \u2264 \u00d7 \u2264 8), the polyhedral structure of Al-H cannot be formed with six polymorphic modifications  [77] . Thus, it can be deduced that polymers Al-H x (x = 1, 2, 3 the coordinated Al species is six polymorphic modification) in an amorphous state was formed during the milling process. After milling for 3 h, LiAlCl 4 NMR peak disappeared (Fig.  7c ), thus, it is very likely that LiAlCl 4 as an intermediate product were entirely consumed in the reaction. Additionally, peak corresponding to the 6-coordinated Al changed significantly, which was due to the phase conversion of the intermediate products during extended milling. Thus, NMR can be used as an indicator of the mechanochemical reaction termination. Humphries and Hwang associated the resonance bands at \u02dc6.0 ppm with the \u03b1-AlH 3 phase  [78, 79] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe four-coordinated Al signal may be assigned to a superposition of the central transition powder patterns from LiAlCl 4 or LiAlH 4 . With the above XRD analysis, this band corresponds to the four-coordinated Al in LiAlCl 4 , which is the intermediate product. The same results were observed using DPMAS spectra obtained by Hlova et al.  [7] . These results also agree with our XRD analysis. With 1 h milling, NMR spectrum also confirmed the presence of LiAlCl 4 but the peak intensity was smaller. NMR spectrum of sample milled for 1 h exhibited broad peaks around at \u02dc33 ppm and \u02dc6 ppm (see Fig.  7b ), indicating formation of the 6-coordinated Al. The amorphous intermediate products might have more than one Al species because Li-Al-H and Al-H both have priorities in the formation during the mechanochemical reaction. However, the coordinated Al species in Li-Al-H is different from that in Al-H.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDifferential thermal analysis measurements were performed using a TG-DSC METTLER TOLEDO instruments, the samples were handled and transferred to the instrument in T-zero pans and were heated from 40 to 240 \u00b0C. \n\nResults and discussion\n\n\nMechanochemical synthesis\nSolid-state mechanochemical reaction of Li hydride and AlCl 3 is regarded as a green pathway for producing adduct-free AlH 3  [7, 20, 61] . Brinks reported that ball milling mixture of LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 generates mainly Al and LiCl, with small amounts of \u03b1-AlH 3 and \u03b1\u2032-AlH 3  [40, 41] . Gupta et al.  [20]  suggested that gas pressure affects decomposition of the metastable hydrides into the metal and hydrogen under the mechanochemical conditions. To prevent AlH 3 from decomposing during the ball milling and to find an efficient and cost-effective mechanochemical process for \u03b1-AlH 3 synthesis, we conducted LiH/AlCl 3 reaction under various hydrogen pressures.

Using this approach, patients with myocardial infarction can be differentiated from those with unstable angina. The present study aims to develop an integrated model, based on the feature selection and classification, for the automatic classification of ACS.\nMethods: A dataset containing medical records of 809 patients suspected to suffer from ACS was used. For each subject, 266 clinical factors were collected. At first, a feature selection was performed based on interviews with 20 cardiologists; thereby 40 seminal features for classifying ACS were selected. Next, a feature selection algorithm was also applied to detect a subset of the features with the best classification accuracy. As a result, the feature numbers considerably reduced to only seven. Lastly, based on the seven selected features, eight various common pattern recognition tools for classification of ACS were used.\nResults: The performance of the aforementioned classifiers was compared based on their accuracy computed from their confusion matrices. Among these methods, the multi-layer perceptron showed the best performance with the 83.2% accuracy.\nConclusion: The results reveal that an integrated AI-based feature selection and classification approach is an effective method for the early and accurate classification of ACS and ultimately a timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, a tremendous performance from this classifier should not be expected.\n\nNaive Bayes\nApplying Naive Bayes classifier, each new sample is assigned to the most probable class based on the Bayes decision making. The probability functions of the classes are empirically estimated from the training data. In spite of the low computational complexity, this method has a relatively high performance  [20] .\n\nIterative dichotomiser-3\nDecision trees are powerful and effective approaches to create a classification model. This method is a flow-chart-like tree structure, where a tree is constructed by the \"if-then\" rules (i.e. A logical sequence of questions) extracted from the training data  [9, 21] . A new case can be classified by starting at the root of the tree and moving through it until a leaf is encountered. Decision trees have become one of the most widely applied methods among numerous classification approaches, because these are white box models with easy-to-interpret results. In addition, its construction does not need any domain knowledge or parameter setting and thus is appropriate for exploratory knowledge discovery  [22, 23] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese factors along with the values and data types are shown in Table  1 . In the current study, we utilized both numerical and categorical variables. The numerical variables were re-scaled to [-1, 1], by min-max normalization technique. The re-scaling was carried out in order to deal with the inconsistencies between different features. This transformation technique has two important advantages. The main advantage of min-max normalization lies in its ability to rescale the values so that they fall within a predetermined range. In addition, it reserves the relationships between the initial data  [13] .\n\nPattern recognition methods\nDifferent classification methods for modeling ACS data were applied to achieve different classifiers for classifying of new subjects. The classifying performance of these classifiers was compared with respect to their performance in classification prediction. These classification methods, described in the following section, were selected from different tools including GLMs, ANFIS, RBF, k-NN, MLP, Naive Bayes, ID3, and Bgging-ID3.\n\nGeneralized linear models\nGLMs are powerful methods in applied statistical, which generalizes the ordinary linear models  [14] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs a result, the feature numbers considerably reduced to only seven. Finally, eight different common pattern recognition methods were used to classify the subtypes of ACS based on the seven selected features. The performance of the classifiers was then compared based on their accuracy computed from their confusion matrices. The MLP and 7-NN methods showed the highest accuracy was 83.24% and 82.92%, respectively. The GLM and ANFIS methods, on the other hand, showed the lowest overall classification accuracy of 68.5% and 71.3%, respectively. Overall, MLP showed the best performance between these classifiers. Although MLP classifier is slightly more accurate than k-NN classifier, k-NN has some advantages such as simple implementability, understandability and interpretability; hence, future research is needed to further elucidate this model. In summary, early accurate classification of ACS by the incorporation of an AI-based feature selection with an AI-based classifier demonstrated promising results that can be used in the clinical field to timely diagnose and treat ACS patients.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The older adult population is estimated to be doubled during next 40 years in the world  [4] . Today, aging has become a major global phenomenon and according to WHO statistics, the number of older adult in Southwest Asian countries, including Iran, will reach 15% of the total population by 2030  [5] . Other reports suggest that the number of people aged \u226560 years will increase from 841 million people in 2013 to 1.2 billion people in 2025, with 70% of them living in developing countries and 8 out of every 10 older adult people in the world are expected to live in developing areas by 2050  [6] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMoreover, increasing families' awareness of depression in the older adult will also pave the way for early diagnosis and more appropriate treatment.\n\nLimitations\nThe most important limitations of the current study include the lack of access to full text and the poor quality of some of the studies studied.\n\nConclusion\nConsidering the high prevalence of severe depression in the Iranian older adult, it is necessary for health policy makers to take effective control measures including periodic care for the older adult.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This association is so conspicuous in the case of bees that other groups of potential pollinators, especially flies, have long been underestimated. However, visitors are not always pollinators. While the importance of flies in plant-visitor networks is now acknowledged, their pollination effectiveness has hardly been investigated. In this study, we assessed the pollination effectiveness of Geranium sylvaticum flower-visitors using single-visit seed set experiments, in a subalpine meadow where flies are predominant. We found that: (i) empidine dance flies were the most frequent visitors of G. sylvaticum; (ii) a single-visit by an empidine dance fly produced the same average number of seeds as a visit by a bee; (iii) large pollinators were more efficient than small pollinators irrespective of their identity. As a conclusion, large empidines were the main pollinators of G. sylvaticum. Considering the high diversity and abundance of flower-visiting fly species, such results showing their ability to be as effective pollinators as bees should encourage further studies to develop a better understanding on their role in plant-pollinator networks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs visits by large bees or empidines   Considering how frequently interactions between empidines and numerous flowering plant species have been reported in the literature since Darwin  [13, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , it is surprising that their role in the reproductive success of those plants had never been addressed. They are obligate floral-visitors with more than 2000 described species worldwide which, contrary to the commonly accepted assumptions that they are generalists and poor pollinators, could reveal high levels of specialization and the same pollination efficiency as bees. Their high abundance and diversity throughout the favourable season suggest that they are important pollinators in mountains and at high latitudes  [14] . Like empidine dance flies, numerous species of calliphorids, conopids, muscids, anthomyids, tabanids and many other fly families depend on nectar and pollen for feeding. In habitats where bees are unable to thrive, flies often represent the predominant biotic vector carrying pollen grains from one flower to another, and therefore the main potential pollinators. Funding.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFlies (Diptera) represent the most conspicuous group of flower-visitors and potential pollinators after bees  [5] [6] [7] , especially in cool to cold habitats of high altitude or latitude where wild bees become naturally scarcer  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, most studies including dipterans address only flower visitation frequencies, which King et al.  [15]  consider a poor proxy for pollinator effectiveness. Visitors are indeed not always pollinators, a visit being likely to enhance the reproductive success of a plant only when it results in conspecific pollen deposition on its stigma. Therefore, direct measures of pollinator effectiveness and plant reproductive success should be performed, respectively, through single-visit stigmatic pollen deposition and seed set after single-visit experiments  [16, 17] . To our knowledge, very few studies include such experiments on flower-visiting Diptera, although some of them challenge the common assumption that bees are the best pollinators: e.g.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nhoverflies can pollinate strawberries as efficiently as bees  [18] , and a blowfly (Calliphoridae) was shown to be as efficient as honeybees and other flower-visitors together in pollinating hybrid carrots  [19] . Moreover, the first study comparing syrphids with other Diptera found no differences in pollen-loads specialization  [20] . Those results cast light on the lack of knowledge about the role played by most flower-visiting fly families in the pollination of angiosperms. To assess the effectiveness of dipterans as pollinators of a wild plant relative to other foraging insects, we used Geranium sylvaticum L. and its flower-visitors as a model, in a subalpine environment where wild bees are scarce. Our objectives were: (i) to quantify the visitor cortege of G. sylvaticum; (ii) to assess the pollination effectiveness of the main flower-visitors using single-visit seed set experiments; (iii) to test whether pollination effectiveness was related to species identity or species traits, such as body size and visit duration.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Females may compensate for their loss of male fitness by reallocating resources from male function (pollen production and pollinator attraction) to female function (seeds and fruits), thus increasing seed production. Females may also benefit from their inability to self-fertilize if selfing and inbreeding depression reduce seed quality in hermaphrodites. We investigated how differences in floral resource allocation (flower size) between female and hermaphroditic plants affect two measures of female reproductive success, pollinator visitation and pollen receipt, in gynodioecious populations of Geranium richardsonii in Colorado. Using emasculation treatments in natural populations, we further examined whether selfing by autogamy and geitonogamy comprises a significant proportion of pollen receipt by hermaphrodites. Flowers of female plants are significantly smaller than those of hermaphrodites. The reduction in allocation to pollinator-attracting structures (petals) is correlated with a significant reduction in pollinator visitation to female flowers in artificial arrays. The reduction in attractiveness is further manifested in significantly less pollen being deposited on the stigmas of female flowers in natural populations. Autogamy is rare in these protandrous flowers, and geitonogamy accounts for most of the difference in pollen receipt between hermaphrodites and females. Female success at receiving pollen was negatively frequency dependent on the relative frequency of females in populations. Thus, two of the prerequisites for the maintenance of females in gynodioecious populations, differences in resource allocation between floral morphs and high selfing rates in hermaphrodites, occur in G. richardsonii. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch protandry suggests that avoidance of selfing has been a strong selection pressure in the evolution of G. richarsonii's floral biology and mating system. Selfing can depress fitness in both self-compatible and self-incompatible species due to inbreeding depression and interference between self-and outcross pollen, respectively (reviewed by  de Jong et al., 1993; Snow et al., 1996) .  Kearns (1990)  inferred that G. richardsonii was self-incompatible or required a minimum threshold quantity of pollen for successful self-fertilization based on a limited number of hand crosses. Recent hand pollination experiments (K. O'Malley, C. Williams, and M. Kuchenreuther, unpublished data) have shown that G. richardsonii does self and suffers inbreeding depression in fruit and seed set. Although autogamy appears rare in G. richardsonii, because of its large, asynchronous floral display, geitonogamy may contribute significantly to selfing in this species.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nGiven the large standard errors surrounding counts of pollen receipt, [Vol. 87 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY these figures only provide crude estimates of levels of autogamy and geitonogamy. They do suggest that selfing, primarily through geitonogamy, occurs at magnitudes sufficient to depress hermaphrodite fitness if selfing results in inbreeding depression. These estimates also appear to reflect actual levels of selfing occurring in the field. Genetic estimates of selfing rates, including geitonogamy, in open-pollinated hermaphrodites  (Ritland and Jain, 1981)  from four populations of G. richardsonii at RMBL ranged from 51 to 67% (mean \u03ed 61%) (K. O'Malley, C. Williams, and M. Kuchenreuther, unpublished data).  Agren and Willson (1991)  estimated that the selfing rates in two populations of Geranium maculatum were 60 and 73%, based on inbreeding depression.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSimilarly high selfing rates have been found in hermaphrodites of other gynodioecious species (23-25% in Limnanthes douglasii-  Kesseli and Jain, 1984; 11-76% in Bidens-Sun and Ganders, 1986; 18-61% in Salvia pratensis, Van Treuren et al., 1993; 88-100% in Chionographis japonica-Maki, 1993; . 73% in Cucurbita foetidissima-  Kohn and Biardi, 1995; 68% in Schiedea adamantis-Sakai et al., 1997) . A puzzling result of the pollination experiments were the sometimes smaller estimates of pollen receipt on stigmas of unemasculated flowers than on emasculated flowers on unemasculated plants (U vs. E in autogamy experiment; C vs. U in geitonogamy experiment). A possible explanation for these results may be that the stamens, particularly the filaments, may act as a physical barrier to small pollinators contacting the stigmatic surface.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, identifying epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs and characterizing their functional mechanisms in different cancer subtypes are still major challenges for cancer studies. In this study, we systematically analyzed the epigenetic alterations of lncRNAs at important regulatory elements in three breast cancer subtypes. We identified 87, 691, and 1,197 epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs in luminal, basal, and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, respectively. The landscape of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements revealed that epigenetic changes of the majority of lncRNAs occurred in a subtype-specific manner and contributed to subtype-specific biological functions. We identified six acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27ac)-dysregulated lncRNAs and three DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs (CTC-303L1.2, RP11-738B7.1, and SLC26A4-AS1) as prognostic biomarkers of basal subtype. These lncRNAs were involved in immune response-related biological functions. Treatment of the basal breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 with CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors downregulated H3K27 acetylation levels and caused a decrease in the expression of five H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs (LINC00393, KB-1836B5.1, RP1-140K8.5, AC005162.1, and AC020916.2) and inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells. One epigenetically dysregulated lncRNA (LINC01983) and four lncRNA regulators (UCA1, RP11-221J22.2, RP11-221J22.1, and RP1-212P9.3) were identified as prognostic biomarkers of the luminal molecular subtype of breast cancer by controlling the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation, and T cell migration. Finally, our results highlighted a profound role of enhancer-related H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs, DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs, and lncRNA regulators in breast cancer subtype carcinogenesis and their potential prognostic value. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS2A ). These results suggest that lncRNAs with complex splicing patterns are more likely regulated by aberrant epigenetic modifications. In addition, we compared the expression level and expression variation of epi-lncRNAs with other lncRNAs to characterize the expression pattern of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess expression variation of genes among patients with breast cancer. lncRNAs showed substantially lower expression levels than did PCGs in all three breast cancer subtypes, which has been described in previous studies.  17  Interestingly, epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs displayed substantially higher expression levels and lower expression variation compared with other lncRNAs in all three breast cancer subtypes (p < 0.05). Consistently, we observed higher expression levels and lower expression variation of epigenetically dysregulated PCGs compared with other PCGs in the basal and claudin-low subtypes (p < 0.05; Figure  S2B ). These results suggest that epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs are stably expressed in breast cancer subtypes and may be suitable as potential biomarkers for breast cancer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n22  Taken together, a large number of epigenetic-dysregulated lncRNAs, including many known breast cancer lncRNAs, show distinct epigenetically dysregulated patterns in different breast cancer subtypes. Investigation of these lncRNAs might provide approaches for the subtype-specific treatment of breast cancer. Epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements are associated with disease prognosis in breast cancer subtypes To gain insights into the potential prognostic value of dysregulated H3K27ac at enhancer elements, DNA methylation-associated lncRNAs and lncRNA regulators were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression analysis (see Materials and methods). We found six enhancer-related epi-lncRNAs with differential histone modification in the basal subtype (LINC00393, KB-1836B5.1, CASC11, RP1-140K8.5, AC005162.1, and AC020916.2) and were able to significantly distinguish patients in high-risk groups from those in lowrisk groups in terms of overall survival (Table  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese observations may suggest a heavy immune infiltration in basal breast cancer. This is supported by previous studies that showed that a considerable number of immune response-related genes exhibit significant variable expression across the basal cell subtype. Targeting these enhancer-related epi-lncRNAs in the basal subtype may help to achieve a more favorable response to immune therapy. We further investigated the effects of C646 treatment in the expression of six H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs in human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cells. C646 is a histone acetyltransferase CREBBP/EP300 inhibitor. As expected, inhibition of CREBBP/EP300 histone acetyltransferase activity resulted in a significant loss of active enhancer mark H3K27ac (Figure  4E ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The first targeted therapy, sorafenib, prolonged the overall survival by months. However, resistance often occurs, largely limits its efficacy. Sorafenib was found to target the electron transport chain complexes, which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain sorafenib resistance and further facilitate tumor progression, cancer cells develop strategies to overcome excessive ROS production and obtain resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we investigated the roles of ROS in sorafenib resistance, and found suppressed ROS levels and reductive redox states in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells maintained greater functional and morphological integrity under the treatment of sorafenib. However, cellular oxygen consumption rate and mitochondria DNA content analyses revealed fewer numbers of mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells. Further investigation attributed this finding to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, likely caused by the accelerated degradation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC1\u03b2). Mechanistic dissection showed that upregulated UBQLN1 induced PGC1\u03b2 degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner to attenuate mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS production in sorafenib-resistant cells under sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, clinical investigations further indicated that the patients with higher UBQLN1 levels experienced worse recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, we propose a novel mechanism involving mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS homeostasis in sorafenib resistance, which may offer new therapeutic targets and strategies for HCC patients. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe antioxidant system in most drug-resistant cancer cells is complicated.  29  Sorafenib, as a multi-kinase inhibitor, may regulate redox homeostasis in drug-resistant cancer cells. Thus, we monitored the redox balance between biological redox couples, such as GSH/GSSG, NADPH/NADP, and NAD/NADH in parental and resistant cells. In general, compared with parental cell lines, a relative reductive state was found in resistant cell lines (Fig.  2g ). Interestingly, NADH/NAD+ in HepG2 cells and NADPH/NADP+ in SK-Hep-1 cells showed inconsistent trends, indicating a general reductive but cell line-specific redox homeostasis in sorafenib resistance. Taken together, these results indicate that resistant cells retain better mitochondrial function and integrity with less mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity, resulting in reduced ROS production in response to sorafenib treatment and sustained sorafenib resistance. Accelerated PGC1\u03b2 degradation inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation in sorafenib-resistant cells Cells have developed finely tuned and complex mechanisms to adapt to stress conditions and metabolic demand alterations by modulating mitochondrial number and function.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA lower mitochondrial volume is associated with the Warburg effect, which also contributes to tumor progression,  44  as well as being a critical metabolic characteristic of cell stemness restoration,  45  while both stemness maintenance and the Warburg effect contribute to sorafenib resistance.  46, 47  Another recent study  48  suggested that mitochondrial TXNRD3 confers drug resistance via a redox-mediated mechanism, further supporting the findings of our current study. In addition, the alterations of biological redox couples vary in different cell lines, suggesting a cell line-specific, but generally reductive reprogramming in sorafenib-resistant cells and OE-PGC1\u03b2 cells, compared with their controls. Mitochondrial biogenesis is a complex process.  21  Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the transcriptional family of PGC1, which is composed of PGC1\u03b1, PGC1-related coactivator, and PGC1\u03b2. These proteins interact with other transcription factors involved in mitochondrial gene expression to regulate genes encoding proteins Fig.  5  The role of UBQLN1 regulated PGC1\u03b2 degradation in sorafenib resistance.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUnexpectedly, we found reduced ROS levels in sorafenib-resistant cells in response to sorafenib treatment, which contributes to the maintenance of resistance. Mitochondria are the first site of ROS production and redox homeostasis, and hypoxia increases ROS levels mainly through affecting the mitochondria. Reduced mitochondrial biogenesis is likely to lead to reduced ROS production, thus a reduced stress for cells and a better adaption to sorafenib treatment. In this study, we found decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation in sorafenib-resistant cells, indicating a critical role of reprogrammed ROS and redox metabolism in response to sorafenib treatment. Notably, our findings are consistent with a recent report from a genome-wide analysis of genes critical for sorafenib resistance.  43  The study found that phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is a critical driver for HCC sorafenib resistance. Inactivation of PHGDH increases ROS levels and induces apoptosis in HCC cells upon sorafenib treatment.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion-anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep-charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion-anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof-of-concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium-based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 , and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch evolution of Raman spectra indicates the anion intercalation into graphite cathode leads to large stress/strain,  [18]  because the anion intercalation process has to conquer the van der Waals interaction inside graphite, and inevitably cause the structure change of graphite cathode. The anion intercalation/ de-intercalation behavior also partially damages the graphite structure. The comparative study implies that the design strategy of LOGC is conducive to weakening the van der Waals interaction and to improving structural stability of cathode in DIBs. HRTEM images suggest that, compared with the pristine sample (ca. 3.56 , Figure  S3 ), the fully charged KB presents an increased interlayer spacing (ca. 4.20 , Figure  3 e ). By contrast, the discharging process gives rise to a decreased interlayer spacing (ca. 3.81 , Figure  3 f ). Such evolution is consistent with the previously reported results of anion-intercalated graphite cathode,  [14]  which further authenticates the occurrence of anionic reversible intercalation/de-intercalation behaviors during galvanostatic charging/discharging processes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDeveloping cost-effective energy storage systems is pivotally important in the implementation of intermittent renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind). Although lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in portable and automotive energy storage systems, the scarcity and uneven distribution of lithium element in Earths crust limit their large-scale applications. \n[1]  Non-lithium batteries such as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),  [2]  potassium-ion batteries (KIBs),  [3]  and aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs),  [4]  therefore, have attracted increasing research interests. However, the search for cation-intercalating cathode materials for these non-lithium rocking-chair batteries is challenging due to the larger ionic radius (e.g., Na + and K + ) or higher charge density (e.g., Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ) of post-lithium cations.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor the calculations, we search the global minimum of each phase by enumerating the anion intercalation stage, anion arrangement, and initial graphite layer distance. Therefore, the blue dots on the convex hull represent the most stable anion intercalation configurations at each PF 6 \u00c0 content x, a species produced during the chargedischarge process. At x 0.5, we find at least three two-phase reactions upon anion intercalation into graphite, where the anion arrangement goes from stage VIII to IV to II.

However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety. However, the poor processibility and relatively low ionic conductivity of Na+ and K+ ions limit the further practical applications of ISEs. PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na+ /K+ ion transfer is summarized. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/KIBs based on PEs are presented. Finally, some suggestions and perspectives are put forward to provide some possible directions for the follow-up researches. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2. High cation migration number (T + \u2248 1). The cation migration number is a measure of the cation mobility in the PEs relative to the anion.  [91]  Reverse movement of anions without being deposited on the electrodes can cause concentration polarization, which results in increased internal impedances and reduced discharge voltages. Single ion conductive PE is used to limit the anion and increase the cation conductivity by covalently binding the anion to the polymer chain or adding an anion acceptor.  [204]  Therefore, how to restrict the migration Reproduced with permission.

[203]  Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. of anions in PEs is a key issue. However, note that different from in \"rocking-chair\" battery systems, in a DIB system, active ions include both cations and anions, which needs a comparable ion transfer kinetics for cations and anions. 3.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[99]  It has been demonstrated that ion migration in PEs is mainly carried out via the amorphous rather than crystalline regions. As a semicrystalline polymer, amorphous and crystalline phases coexist in PEO, which has been considered as one of the main reasons for low ionic conductivity of PEs.  [100, 101]  Many efforts have been devoted to limiting the crystallization level of PEO-based electrolytes, for example, the addition of nanofillers, blending polymers, screening of Na-salts, etc., and thus to increasing the amorphous phase and improving the ionic conductivity of PEO-based SPEs. Inorganic nanoparticles are widely used as nanofillers in PEs, which presents superiority in improving ionic conductivity over that without adding inorganic nanofillers.  [94, 102]  The improved effect can be ascribed to that nanoparticles form an associated network in the polymer and breach the ordered structure of PEO, which is conducive not only to improving the ionic conductivity but also to boosting their mechanical strength.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[90]  To further improve the electrochemical properties of PEs, it is of significance to get fundamental insight into the migration mechanism and transfer kinetics of active ions in PEs. It is generally accepted that the Li + -ion migration in PEs is affected by the fracture/formation of coordination bonds in the segmented movement of polymer chains, which mainly occurs in the amorphous region of the polymer matrices.  [93]  For example, Li + ions first locate at the active site provided by the polar group of PEs (e.g., \ue0c6O\ue0c6 in PEO). Under the driving of the electric field, the local segmental motion of polymer chains induces Li + ions to move/leap from one coordination site to another adjacent active site, and thus realizes ion migration.  [62]  It is theoretically reasonable to infer that the migration of Na + /K + ions in PEs shares a similar mechanism with that of Li + ions, since Na + /K + ions have similar electrochemical activity with Li + ions. However, it is noteworthy that the migration process of different active ions in PEs is not only associated with the type of active ions (ionic radius, charge density, etc.)\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Dovefoot Geranium is a low-growing herb with pink flowers and sharply toothed leaves. Dovefoot Geranium is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to many habitats of the world. This species is very similar to G. robertianum but its palmate-like leaves and bilobed petals show differences. This plant is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. We have no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Therefore, due to the importance of these plant species, we performed a combination of morphological and molecular data for this species. For this study, we used 132 randomly collected plants from 18 geographical populations in 4 provinces. Genetic diversity parameters were determined in these populations. STRUCTURE analysis and K-Means clustering identified 14 gene pools in the country and revealed isolation by distance among the studied populations. The Mantel test showed correlation between genetic and geographical distance. AMOVA revealed a significant genetic difference among populations and showed that 40% of total genetic variation was due to within-population diversity. The consensus tree of both molecular and morphological data identified divergent populations. These data may be used in future breeding and conservation of this important medicinal plant in the country. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nParameter like Nei's gene diversity (H), Shannon information index (I), number of effective alleles, and percentage of polymorphism were determined  [25, 26] . Nei's genetic distance among populations was used for Neighbor Joining (NJ) clustering and Neighbor-Net networking  [26, 27] . The Mantel test was performe as implemented in PAST ver. 2.17  [23, 24] . For this, Nei genetic distance was determined for ISSR data, while Geographic distance of PAST was determined for geographical data. It is calculated based on the sum of the paired differences among both longitude as well as latitude coordinates of the studied populations. AMOVA (Analysis of molecular variance) test (with 1000 permutations) as implemented in GenAlex 6.4  [28]  and Nei,s Gst analysis as implemented in Geno-Dive ver.2 (2013)  [29]  were used to show genetic difference of the populations. Moreover, populations, genetic differentiation was studied by G'ST est = standardized measure of genetic differentiation  [30]  and D_est = Jost measure of differentiation  [31] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis is particularly supported by STRUCTURE plot that identified 14 separate genetic groups within this populations and by consensus tree of both morphological and genetic data. Different mechanisms like isolation, drift, founder effects and local selection may act to bring about among population differentiation and therefore, populations differ in phenotypic traits and allelic composition  [36] . The present population divergence may be under influence of isolation-by distance across the distribution range of the studied G. molle populations. The dispersal of these populations might be constrained by distance and gene flow is most likely to occur between neighboring populations. As a result, more closely situated populations tend to be more genetically similar to one another  [43] [44] [45] . The populations, divergence may be accompanied by local adaptation. When we use multilocus molecular markers (such as SSR, AFLP, RAPD, ISSR, etc.) for population genetic studies we understand that these are neutral molecular markers (they are not directly acting as adaptive genes), but they may be linked to a gene or a genetic region with adaptive value  [26] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDATA ANALYSES\n\n\nMorphological Studies\nMorphological characters were first standardized (Mean = 0, Variance = 1) and used to establish Euclidean distance among pairs of taxa  [23] . For grouping of the plant specimens, the UPGMA (Unweighted paired group using average) and Ward (Minimum spherical characters) as well as ordination methods of MDS (Multidimensional scaling) and PCoA (Principal coordinate analysis) were used  [23] . ANOVA (Analysis of variance) were performed to show morphological difference among the populations while, PCA (Principal components analysis) biplot was used to identify the most variable morphological characters among the studied populations  [23] .

The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated.  24  Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\n\nPaper\nFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis.  20, 25  \n\nDe novo assembly and gene predictions\nOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo better understand the shared richness of each group, a Venn diagram displaying overlaps between groups was produced. This approach showed that a total richness of 1 579 444 OTUs was shared among all samples in Fig.  S1c . \u2020 These data demonstrated that approximately 43.68% of OTUs were reduced after AOM/DSS-treated mice were fed JP, suggesting that JP decreased microbial community diversity and pathogenic bacteria levels, but increased probiotic diversity.  20  In keeping with our previous observations,  20, 24, 30  the most abundant phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Ascomycota and Bacteroidetes in different groups of mice (Fig.  3A ). The most abundant phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Ascomycota and Bacteroidetes in different groups of mice. Other phyla were represented in relatively lower abundances; Mucoromycota, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria and a number of unclassified bacteria.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe greatest statistical difference between JP and M groups were translation, nucleotide metabolism and cell motility. After 13 weeks, JP-associated differentially expressed genes were enriched for different KEGG pathways, involved in metabolism, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and two-component system (Fig.  5 ), and ABC transporters, including those predicted to be involved in sugar and amino acid. In addition, KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes between C and M groups, C and JP groups (data not shown, Fig.  S2 \u2020 ) were mainly enriched in two-component system, after JP supplementation for 13 weeks. Although the ranking varied in different groups, the numbers of differentially expressed genes were dramatically changed within the different groups. The GO database provides three different types of systematic definition for describing the different functions of gene products. GO functions include biological processes, cellular components and molecular function. Biological processes consist of molecular functions with multiple steps;  24  cellular components refer to gene products located in cellular orga-nelles, while molecular functions describe molecular biological activities, such as catalytic and binding activities. For each GO function, we selected seven of the largest GO terms.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many conventional computational methods for identifying N6-methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m6A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m6A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m6A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m6A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting.

Recently, a novel, singlebase-resolution technique, miCLIP-seq  (Ke et al. 2015; Linder et al. 2015) , was also established, which prompted a new wave of research on computational methods of m 6 A identification  (Xiang et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2016) . Notably, m 6 A sites have methylation-specific surroundings, with the topology of a DRACH (where D = A, G, or U; R = A or G; and H = A, C, or U) consensus motif and a GAC consensus motif localized near stop codons, in 3 \u2032 -UTRs, within long internal exons, and at 5 \u2032 -UTRs  (Meyer et al. 2012; Schwartz et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2016) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOther improved works in terms of prediction accuracy on the two data sets were also presented  (Chen et al. 2017b; Xing et al. 2017) . Recently, Zhou et al. established an m 6 A data set from published single-nucleotideresolution maps of human and mouse m 6 A sites  (Ke et al. 2015; Linder et al. 2015) . They then developed an m 6 A predictor named SRAMP  (Zhou et al. 2016) , which simply uses three sequence-derived features with Random Forest classifiers. Following this work,  Xiang et al. (2016)  improved the predictive performance by integrating multiple sequence features, including positional binary nucleotide sequence encoding, nucleotide pair spectrum encoding, positionspecific encoding, and k-mer nucleotide frequency encoding. These methods were used with conventional features in position and frequency statistics, with the sliding window being limited to a narrow region and focusing on only a single species.

However, it has been proven that sequence alignment (e.g., PSI-BLAST) cannot accurately identify the modification sites. Instead, machine learning techniques are used in approaches that are currently popular. For these, a sliding window is selected around the candidate modification sites. Then, sequences in the sliding window are collected for standard machine learning training and testing processes.

Some species are of medicinal importance while some are well known weeds. In arid and semi-arid regions, E. cicutarium has had some importance as a forage plant and is an important grazing plant and source of protein supplements to straw for ruminants in semi deserts and wastelands of the Middle East. There is no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Due to the medicinal importance of this species, a genetic variability and populations\u2019 structure study is performed studying 15 geographical populations of E. cicutarium Therefore, we used six inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and 15 combined IRAP markers to reveal within and among population genetic diversity in this plant. AMOVA test produced significant genetic difference (PhiPT = 0.39, P = 0.010) among the studied populations and also revealed that, 55% of total genetic variability was due to within population diversity while, 45% was due to among population genetic differentiation. Mantel test showed positive significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance of the studied populations. Networking, STRUCTURE analyses and population assignment test revealed some degree of gene flow among these populations. PCoA plot of populations based on morphological characters was in agreement with MDS plot of molecular data. These results indicated that geographical populations of E. cicutarium are well differentiated both in genetic content as well as morphological characteristics.

Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated.  24  Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\n\nPaper\nFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis.  20, 25  \n\nDe novo assembly and gene predictions\nOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo better understand the shared richness of each group, a Venn diagram displaying overlaps between groups was produced. This approach showed that a total richness of 1 579 444 OTUs was shared among all samples in Fig.  S1c . \u2020 These data demonstrated that approximately 43.68% of OTUs were reduced after AOM/DSS-treated mice were fed JP, suggesting that JP decreased microbial community diversity and pathogenic bacteria levels, but increased probiotic diversity.  20  In keeping with our previous observations,  20, 24, 30  the most abundant phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Ascomycota and Bacteroidetes in different groups of mice (Fig.  3A ). The most abundant phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Ascomycota and Bacteroidetes in different groups of mice. Other phyla were represented in relatively lower abundances; Mucoromycota, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria and a number of unclassified bacteria.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe greatest statistical difference between JP and M groups were translation, nucleotide metabolism and cell motility. After 13 weeks, JP-associated differentially expressed genes were enriched for different KEGG pathways, involved in metabolism, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and two-component system (Fig.  5 ), and ABC transporters, including those predicted to be involved in sugar and amino acid. In addition, KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes between C and M groups, C and JP groups (data not shown, Fig.  S2 \u2020 ) were mainly enriched in two-component system, after JP supplementation for 13 weeks. Although the ranking varied in different groups, the numbers of differentially expressed genes were dramatically changed within the different groups. The GO database provides three different types of systematic definition for describing the different functions of gene products. GO functions include biological processes, cellular components and molecular function. Biological processes consist of molecular functions with multiple steps;  24  cellular components refer to gene products located in cellular orga-nelles, while molecular functions describe molecular biological activities, such as catalytic and binding activities. For each GO function, we selected seven of the largest GO terms.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The phase, photocatalytic hydrogen production, microstructure, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the fabricated photocatalysts were investigated. BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst has a larger ability for the hydrogen production in photocatalysis process than that of BiFeO3. The reason of the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst was revealed by the measurements of UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photocurrent curves and electrochemical impedance spectra. Moreover, the magnetic properties of BiFeO3 and BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalysts were also investigated to show the easy separation. These results in current work indicate that BiFeO3:Gd3+ is an excellent photocatalyst and has potential applications in photocatalytic hydrogen production. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nExcept for TiO 2 , various types of photocatalysts were reported in these years, such as titanate  [7, 8] , AM 2 O 4 (A = Cu and Zn, M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co)  [9, 10] , tantalite (niobate)  [11, 12] , sulphide  [13, 14] , ferrite  [15, 16]  and some oxide semiconductor  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . BiFeO 3 is a perovskite-type multiferroic compound, which shows potential applications in spintronics devices due to its high ferroelectric and magnetic phase transitions, as well as large remanent polarization at room temperature  [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, it shows excellently photovoltaic effect and photocatalytic activity because that it can absorb a wide range of sunlight corresponding to its small E g  [26] [27] [28] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor the applications in the photocatalyst field, one of advantages of BiFeO 3 is its excellently magnetic property. It is known that the separation of photocatalysts is essential after the photocatalytic process. Generally, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation are widely used in the separation process although they are complex and expensive  [29, 30] . But the separation process will be easy if the photocatalyst has the magnetism. It means that the photocatalyst can be separated easily by applying an exterior magnetic field. There are some reports for BiFeO 3 in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water  [27, 28, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] ]. Chen's work shows that the hydrothermally-synthesized BiFeO 3 nanocrystals have excellently photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation under visible light irradiation and the surface oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic activity effectively  [37] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo find out the mechanism of the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ , a series of physical and chemical properties of BiFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ were investigated and compared. Fig.  3  shows the microstructural analysis of BiFeO 3 (Fig.  3A ) and BiFeO 3 :Gd 3+ (Fig.  3B ). The SEM images show that a large number of  irregular nanoparticles were produced by the sol-gel process. There are agglomerations between particles. But the agglomeration does not influence the band gap of samples  [34] . In the sol-gel synthesis, the complexing ligands of precursor xerogel wrote over the produced nanocrystals and thus prevented the agglomeration. But the subsequent calcination induced the evaporation of citrate complexing agents. Thus, the nanocrystals agglomerated and grow to be larger due to their high surface energy. These led to the final microstructure of the synthesized photocatalysts. Fig.  3C  and Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Nonetheless, its relatively long crystallization time and harsh synthesis conditions have strongly obstructed the enhancement of HP-MOFs space\u2013time yields (STYs) and the decrease in energy consumption. Herein, a simple and versatile method for preparing various HP-MOFs at room temperature was demonstrated, which had introduced surfactant as the template, whereas zinc oxide (ZnO) has been used as an accelerant. The resulting HP-MOFs showed multimodal hierarchical porous structures and excellent thermal stability. More importantly, the synthesis time was reduced dramatically to 11 min, with a maximal HP-MOFs STY of as high as 2575 kg m\u22123 d\u22121. Furthermore, the rapid formation process of HP-MOFs was examined through quantum chemistry calculation, and a feasible synthesis mechanism was also proposed. Notably, our synthesis strategy had shown a versatility, since other surfactants could also be used as the templates for the rapid room-temperature fabrication of diverse stable HP-MOFs. Importantly, the porosity of the HP-MOFs could be readily tuned through controlling the type of template. Moreover, gas adsorption measurement of HP-MOFs revealed high CH4 uptake capacity at 298 K due to the increase in surface area and pore volume. Our findings suggest that such method is applicable for the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of HP-MOFs on an industrial scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), self-assembled from metal ions (or metal clusters) and organic ligands, have attracted considerable attention during the last two decades owing to their fascinating physical and chemical properties, such as high specific surface areas, tunable structures and porosities, as well as designable functionality  [1] . Therefore, MOFs, which serve as the functional materials, have exhibited huge potential applications in diverse areas  [2, 3] , including gas storage  [4] , adsorption/separation  [5] , supercapacitor  [6] , drug delivery  [7] , sensing  [8]  and catalysis  [9] . Notably, porosity is an essential feature in MOFs, which plays a vital role in functionalization like the diffusion and mass transfer of substrates/products  [10, 11] . However, the pore sizes of the majority of MOFs have been reported to be within a micropore range (pore size \\ 2 nm) during the last few decades  [4, 12, 13] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nConsequently, the primary application of MOFs has focused on small molecules, which has prevented the large molecules to approach or leave the interior active sites owing to the confinement of pore size  [14] . In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to develop efficient methods to synthesize hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) containing micropores and mesopores (or micropores, mesopores and macropores)  [15] . Specifically, the increased length of the bridging ligands is an apparent approach to obtain large pores in the resulting MOFs  [16] . However, it is inevitably associated with certain difficulties, such as extended ligands synthesis, smaller mesopore size (\\ 10 nm), reduced porosity, interpenetration, disintegration and instability of crystal frameworks  [17, 18] . On the other hand, HP-MOFs can also be synthesized through introducing mesopores and/or macropores into the structures of MOFs via the template strategy  [19, 20]  and post-synthetic modification  [21] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(  1 ) STY \u00bc m MOF V solution \u00c1 s \u00c2 1:44 \u00c2 10 6 \u00f01\u00de where m MOF represents the powder mass (g) of the HP-MOFs, V solution represents the total volume (cm 3 ) of the mixture, and s represents the reaction time (min).\n\nResults and discussion\nFigure  1a  shows the wide-angle XRD patterns of the HP-Cu-BTC sample synthesized with a cooperative template method and the C-Cu-BTC, as well as the simulated XRD pattern of Cu-BTC single-crystal.

Moreover, the sharp XRD peaks of HP-Cu-BTC confirm fine crystallinity  [37] . The crystal structure of HP-Cu-BTC was further characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy.

In this paper, the parameter analysis method in signal processing and the meaning and characteristics of each parameter are introduced. Then, the waveform analysis method is introduced and the basic theory of wavelet transform and its spectrum analysis in waveform analysis method are mainly analyzed. The comparison between wavelet transform and Fourier transform is made: traditional Fourier transform signal processing methods can only be used to process transient stationary signals, and the transient non-stationary signals cannot be analyzed locally. The wavelet transform can take into account the characteristics of both the time and frequency domains, and it can also reflect the local signal well. Through the analysis of the signals in the process of concrete damage, it is found that the two signal processing methods mentioned above can well characterize the damage evolution of materials and damage precursors. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe recycled aggregate concrete is studied through a lot of experiments. It is found that the recycled aggregate concrete has high crushing index, low density, high porosity, enhanced water absorption, low aggregate strength and weak bonding ability. The shear strength and compressive strength test showed that the recycled aggregate perforated brick material showed obvious brittleness  [14] ,  [21] ,  [22] . By measuring the low modulus of elasticity of recycled coarse aggregate concrete relative to ordinary concrete, Etxeberria et al. analyzed the effect of material sequence in concrete production (made of recycled aggregate) on improving its splitting tensile strength  [23] . To some extent, these studies have played a positive role in the reuse of construction waste. However, in practical application, such as the increase of wall cracks has become the bottleneck of the development of this new construction material.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn this regard, scholars from all over the world have carried out studies on waste minimization, multiple utilization and harmlessness from the perspectives of waste management methods  [11] , management mode  [12] , optimization process  [13] , recycling  [14] ,  [15] . Among waste, construction waste is the most important component of construction waste, including broken concrete blocks, bricks and so on  [16] . It is one of the most necessary research to reduce environmental pollution by secondary utilization after crushing. However, construction waste cannot be recycled and reused in a full sense  [17] ,  [18] . When it is damaged to a certain extent, it will not be reused. It can only be treated by landfill or open-air stacking. It is one of the important means to solve the problem at present, including effectively judging the damage degree of construction waste, reducing unnecessary secondary treatment and misjudgement of multiple utilization, and making comprehensive use of valuable components  [19] . As a common waste of construction waste, recycled aggregate concrete aggregate has a lot of research on the development and application all over the world  [20] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \na is scale factor, b is time factor. \u03c8(x) need to meet the following conditions: C k = 2\u03c0 +\u221e -\u221e |\u03c8(\u03c9)| 2 |\u03c9| 2 d\u03c9 < \u221e (2) In the formula, \u03c8(\u03c9) is the Fourier transform of \u03c8(x).

The concept of a smart city is introduced to improve the quality of city life. Smart cities are being developed to satisfy the need for the safety of its users\u2019 and secure journeys over in the urban scenario by proposing the smart mobility concept. At the same time, Vehicular adhoc network (VANET) comes under the type of mobile adhoc network (MANET), wherever the vehicles are treated as nodes in a network. The application of Big Data technologies to VANET gains useful insight from the massive quantity of operational data to enhance traffic management process like planning, engineering as well as operation. During the real-time processes, the VANET generates large data, and the VANET characteristics are mapped to Big Data attributes. Moreover, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed for routing in vehicular networks over Hadoop Map Reduce standalone distributed framework and over multi-node cluster with 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes. The simulation outcomes ensure that the processing time of the algorithm is significant decreases with a rise in the node count of the Hadoop framework. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe artificial ants are practically independent agents; besides, by the updation and stochastic pursuing of pheromone tables, it contributes in a stigmergic communication process. The outcome is a collective learning behavior, in that single ant has very low complication as well as less significant, whereas the entire swarm gathers and maintains up-to-date routing data. The pheromone data is employed for the routing of data packets, probably in the similar means as routing ants packets stochastically, providing a high possibility of links with more pheromone ranges. Similarly, information for the same destination is broadcasted in many routers leads to proper load distribution. For data packets, some processes are employed to eliminate low-quality routes, since ants have great exploration, hence less good routes are sporadically sampled as well as managed. When adequate ants are passed to various destinations, nodes get updated information about the optimal paths and adapts with the distribution of load in an automatic manner. The route selection by the ACO algorithm is shown in Fig.  5 . ACO algorithm uses ant-like control packets to explore the routes between pair of nodes as well as to improve the available routing information.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo attain this, a routing mechanism is required which can be shared among two communication entities as well as it incorporates the process of a route organization, forwarding decision information as well as the action in managing the route and/or recover when the routing process fails. Though several routing protocols exist, ACO algorithm offers several benefits such as Inherent parallelism, Positive Feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, Efficient for Traveling Salesman Problem and similar problems and it can be used in dynamic applications (adapts to changes such as new distances, etc.). So, ACO algorithm is preferred over other algorithms. ACO algorithm  (Medina and Cortes, 2010a)  follow the fundamental standard of procuring routing data by employing the path sampling process by sending control packets, known as ants. The ants are produced concurrently and autonomously at the nodes, with the method of testing a route from one node to the other node. The ant gathers data regarding the path eminence like latency, hop count, and so on, utilizes this information for updating the routing information at the mediatory nodes.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhen calculating traffic conditions during poor climatic conditions, logistics organization can provide an optimal path which allows best routes for proper time delivery. There is a requirement of creating models that may foresee regardless of whether accidents are probably going to happen due to the nature of street as well as driver reaction, in the long run prompting more secure streets. This research has uncovered various advantages such as high safety, low transportation cost, user-friendly, and predictable material deliverance for producing, that is particularly critical for modern just-in-time manufacturing. An individual application can be employed to create or generate different kinds of data which is established quickly and has to process rapidly. The conventional relational databases cannot handle this massive quantity of data, and there is a requirement of efficient methods to manage it. Hadoop is an open-source environment which processes the high volume of information  (Barlow, 2013) . At the point, when an organization requires saving of large measure of data, they have two choices: use a large machine by additional CPU, RAM, disk space and so forth otherwise discuss with database sellers for better solutions. But, each of the two choices has their issues, and there is a tradeoff over securing a big device.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The tool pin geometry directly affects the generation of heat and the flow of internal materials during the FSW process. The effects of the FSW tool pin angle on heat generation and internal flow have not been quantitatively investigated in detail. In this manuscript, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was implemented to analyze the effects of pin angle on the thermo-mechanical action during the FSW process of AA5058 Al-Mg alloy. Experimental test results validate the thermal outcomes of the used model. The obtained results revealed that, when the pin angle is increased, the heat generation decreases while the mechanical action of the tool increases. The internal heat distribution at a higher pin angle is symmetrical. The higher mechanical action of the tool decreases the viscosity of the internal materials and increases stirring action (materials flow) around the pin. Furthermore, plastic flow near the tool increased stirring action and formed a larger stir zone in the joint area.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this case, it is necessary to solve Navier-Stokes equations  [32] [33] [34] [35] .

The FSW tool had rotational movement, and the interior domain was set to move according to the welding tool speed. The interior domain had the same velocity as the welding tool by the velocity inlet side. The sidewalls, along with the top and bottom, had the same velocity as the velocity of the inlet.

One of the main solutions for increasing the available capacity is the predetermined plan for constructing a water circulation system to restore the existing water resources. For this objective, a combination model was conducted based on a stormwater management technique and environment landscape system (ELS) under drought conditions. A hydrological framework was established using the long-term meteorological information in central China to estimate the extreme values of surface water in each stress period. A data analysis system was generated at three meteorological points of the study area and the developed model was incorporated to simulate the behavior of the subsurface flow. Consequently, a growth simulation model was designed according to the soil structure and vegetation canopy cover to formulate a real-time plan for the restoration of ELS. Results showed that the proposed model could improve the water productivity in urban and environment consumptions. Furthermore, technical analysis confirmed the suitability and applicability of the developed plan in cities with water shortages. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nEFF \u00bc 1 \u00c0 P n i\u00bc1 (O m \u00c0 O c ) 2 P n i\u00bc1 (O m \u00c0 O m ) 2 0 B B B @ 1 C C C A \u00d7 100 (7) RMSE \u00bc 1 \u00c0 P n i\u00bc1 (O m \u00c0 O c ) 2 n 0 B B @ 1 C C A 1 2 (8) CRM \u00bc 1 \u00c0 P n i\u00bc1 O m \u00c0 P n i\u00bc1 O c P n i\u00bc1 O m 0 B B B @ 1 C C C A \u00d7 100 (9) where O m is the measured value, O c is the calibrated value, n is the number of samples used and O is the average value of the observed parameter.

Al-MOF has been extensively characterized using FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, FE-SEM, TG-DTA, and Brunauer \u2013 Emmett \u2013 Teller (BET) techniques. The prepared samples, which included large hexagons and triangular channels, had a pore size of about 20 nm and a surface area of about 1245.2 m2/g, according to the results. The mechanism of the formation of Al-MOF has been proposed based on density functional theory with B3LYP and 6\u201331 G (d,p) as the basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbits (HOMO) to the lowest unusable molecular orbit (LUMO) are also used to discuss chemical reactivity patterns in molecules. Al-MOF has demonstrated anticancer activity against human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines, suggesting that it could be a promising anticancer drug for clinical use. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDensity functional theory (DFT)\nDensity functional theory (DFT) (i.e., a ground-state theory used to determine the ground states of a quantum system in order to estimate relevant values, such as ground state energy) is an intriguing and powerful tool  [30]  . The particle density of a system with interacting N particles is used as the original value in DFT instead of the wave function  [31]  . Frontier orbital energy gap is the subtraction of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO). The Frontier orbital energy gap could be used to determine the interaction between different species. Harmonic vibrational waves were calculated using second-order analytical derivatives to confirm the convergence of minimums on the potential surface and to evaluate the zero-vibration contrast energy. As shown in Fig.  2  , in the finitecharge regime at one of the metal/molecule interfaces, the role of non-boundary modes is important, as these channels provide additional channels through which they can be used. An interface can be used to transmit the load  [32]  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAn interface can be used to transmit the load  [32]  . As a result, the VESTA software used HOMO-LUMO to determine the most likely mechanism of Al-MOF formation  [33]  . Using the Gauss-09 quantum chemistry package, kinetic and thermochemical data were estimated at the theoretical DFT level  [34]  . Since absolute values of the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of the molecule can be obtained by theoretical calculation, the enthalpy of the reaction and the Gibbs energy of each possible reaction are obtained by using these energy values  [35]  . The CA ineludible C = C, C -H, H -O, and C -O bonds must be taken into account during the interaction with the aluminium precursor. The optimization of appropriate molecules was carried out using the B3LYP theory by the 6-31 G set  [15]  . Gaussian 09 was used to make the estimates  [36]  . All optimized structures of S. hortensis were confirmed to have minimal energy compatibility.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe samples were heated upto 700 \u00b0C at the rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model used the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (at the temperature of 196 \u00b0C) after the separation at 200 \u00b0C and 10-5 mm Hg for at least 4 h to estimate surface-specific regions. The mesoporous size distribution and total mesoporous volume were estimated using the modified Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. GC-MS analysis was also performed using a Thermoquest-Finigan gas chromatograph (equipped with a DB-1 column silica capillary column (60 m * 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness = 0.25 \u03bcm) with four polarization of TRACE mass.

The experimental data are discussed, and the analysis using ANSYS AUTODYN 14.5 is provided. The desensitization phenomenon is well reproduced in numerical simulation using the JWL EOS and the Lee\u2013Tarver kinetic equation for modeling of the initiation of heterogeneous high explosives with as well as without shock front waves. The analysis of the wave processes occurring during the initiation of the acceptor HE charge has been carried out. Peculiarities of the wave processes in the water gap test assemblies, which can influence the results of sensitivity measurement, have been studied. In particular, it has been established that precursor waves in the walls of the gap test assemblies can influence the detonation transmission distance. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nExplosive behind the thin layer is dead and does not react. A strong second shock sent behind the first into the dead explosive propagates as an inert shock. Not until the second shock overtakes the first shock and is moving into unshocked explosive does the initiation process start.\n\nNumerical modeling\nThe goal of our work has been to study the wave processes in the water gap test-based experimental assemblies that lead to desensitization of acceptor Composition B charges after loading by a precursor wave passing through an inert element placed on the symmetry axis of the assembly. For this purpose, numerical simulation of the detonation transfer from donor to acceptor HE charges has been performed in the configuration most closely corresponding to the experimental conditions. Simulations were carried out using ANSYS AUTODYN 14.5  [12] . Simulation area configurations reproduced the experimental assemblies with one exception: instead of square 20 \u00d7 20 mm prisms used in the experiments, the simulated assembly included round rods with the diameter of 22 mm. Thus, we were able to use a 2D axisymmetric setup instead of 3D. Because of the axial symmetry, only half of the experimental assembly cross section has been modeled.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFigure  2h , i show the material flow fields and HE pressure and decomposition contours on the late stage of the process at t = 30 \u00b5s. Figure  3  shows pressure and degree of decomposition profiles on the symmetry axis of acceptor HE charge at times of 14.25 and 30 \u00b5s. The maximum pressure in the acceptor HE charge at t = 30 \u00b5s equals 0.8 GPa. The maximum degree of decomposition is observed near the end of the ceramic rod and it has practically not changed since the moment t = 14.25 \u00b5s. Because of the reflection from the identification specimen, the process of initiation by the reflected wave is observed for some time and at t = 30 \u00b5s the degree of decomposition reaches approximately 0.15. Thus, it is shown that precursor waves in gap test assemblies can influence the detonation transmission distance due to desensitization of the acceptor HE charge. It is also shown that the presence of the identification steel specimen can lead to erroneous results when using the gap test due to possible initiation of acceptor HE charge by the wave reflected from the specimen.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause of the axial symmetry, only half of the experimental assembly cross section has been modeled. Numerical integration of the continuum mechanics equations together with defining parameters for materials and corresponding initial and boundary conditions has been per- formed on a regular Eulerian mesh with a spatial resolution of 10 cells per mm. The detonation wave was initiated as a plane wave and propagated from the left to the right boundary of the Eulerian mesh. Boundary conditions on the left, right, and upper boundaries were defined in terms of AUTODYN as \"Flow out.\" The lower boundary was the symmetry axis. The most difficult problem in numerical modeling is selecting the most appropriate model and the equation of state parameters for materials used in the simulation. EOS parameters for inert materials were selected from the standard library with the exception of silicon carbide, for which we have selected a model most closely corresponding to the experimental results of paper  [7] . The Lee-Tarver ignition and growth model has been used to describe the behavior of the Composition B acceptor HE charge  [13] [14] [15] [16] , etc.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Although, professional stock analysts and fund managers usually make subjective judgments, based on objective technical indicators, it is difficult for non-professionals to apply this forecasting technique because there are too many complex technical indicators to be considered. Moreover, two drawbacks have been found in many of the past forecasting models: (1) statistical assumptions about variables are required for time series models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), to produce forecasting models of mathematical equations, and these are not easily understood by stock investors; and (2) the rules mined from some artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as neural networks (NN), are not easily realized.\n\nIn order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model, using multi-technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Further, it includes four proposed procedures in the hybrid model to provide efficient rules for forecasting, which are evolved from the extracted rules with high support value, by using the toolset based on rough sets theory (RST): (1) select the essential technical indicators, which are highly related to the future stock price, from the popular indicators based on a correlation matrix; (2) use the cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA) and minimize the entropy principle approach (MEPA) to partition technical indicator value and daily price fluctuation into linguistic values, based on the characteristics of the data distribution; (3) employ a RST algorithm to extract linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset; and (4) utilize genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to get better forecasting accuracy and stock return. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with two types of performance evaluations, accuracy and stock return, and by using a six-year period of the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) as the experiment dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, RST and GAs). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nEach selected experimental dataset is split into two subdatasets: training and testing datasets. The refined rules, extracted by the proposed model from the training dataset, are used for forecasting the testing dataset and calculating stock return, based on the trading strategies, as follows: (i) ''buy on open and sell on close,\" when the selected rule indicates that the forecasted price fluctuation of the next day is ''going up;\" (ii) ''sell on open and buy on close,\" when the selected rule indicates that forecasted price fluctuation of the next day is ''going down;\" and (iii) ''no transaction,\" when the selected rule indicates that the forecasted price fluctuation of the next day is ''staying flat.\" Based on the refined rules and the strategies, the returns for the proposed model can be calculated and summarized.\n\nEvaluation and comparison.\nIn this procedure, two types of performance evaluations, forecasting accuracy and stock return, are employed.

Compared with the conventional neural network learning algorithm it overcomes the slow training speed and over-fitting problems. ELM is based on empirical risk minimization theory and its learning process needs only a single iteration. The algorithm avoids multiple iterations and local minimization. It has been used in various fields and applications because of better generalization ability, robustness, and controllability and fast learning rate. In this paper, we make a review of ELM latest research progress about the algorithms, theory and applications. It first analyzes the theory and the algorithm ideas of ELM, then tracking describes the latest progress of ELM in recent years, including the model and specific applications of ELM, finally points out the research and development prospects of ELM in the future.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this paper, it is shown that EM-ELMs can also be cast as a particular case of SAOCIF. In particular, EM-ELMs can easily be extended to test some number of random candidates at each step and select the best of them, as SAOCIF does. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the cost of the computation of the optimal output-layer weights in the originally proposed EM-ELMs can be improved if it is replaced by the one included in SAOCIF. In addition, there are still a lot of applications about ELM in other areas. An improved ELM method was proposed for soft sensing modeling by  Chang et al. (2007) . By adding a kind of sorting neurons into the hidden layer of the single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), a new SLFN structure was proposed. The method provided a new approach to build soft sensing models, and it was successfully applied to the soft sensing modeling the of cell concentration for the Nosiheptied fermentation process to realize the online prediction of the cell concentration.  Pan et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe equivalence of a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) to a generalized single hidden layer feedforward network is shown first, which is then used to develop the OS-Fuzzy-ELM algorithm. This results in a FIS that can handle any bounded non-constant piecewise continuous membership function. Furthermore, the learning in OS-Fuzzy-ELM can be done with the input data coming in a one-by-one mode or a chunk-by-chunk mode with fixed or varying chunk size. In OS-Fuzzy-ELM, all the antecedent parameters of membership functions are randomly assigned first, and then, the corresponding consequent parameters are determined analytically. Performance comparisons of OS-Fuzzy-ELM with other existing algorithms are presented using realworld benchmark problems in the areas of nonlinear system identification, regression, and classification. To solve the problem of extreme learning machine (ELM) online training with sequential training samples, a new algorithm called selective forgetting extreme learning machine (SF-ELM) is proposed by  Zhang (2011)  and applied to chaotic time series prediction.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause of the random choice of input weights and biases, the ELM algorithm sometimes makes the hidden layer output matrix H of SLFN not full column rank, which lowers the effectiveness of ELM. An effectiveness improved algorithm of ELM was proposed by  Wang and Cao (2011)  called EELM that makes a proper selection of the input weights and biases before calculating the output weights, which ensures the full column rank of H in theory. This improves to some extend the learning rate and the robustness property of the networks. The experimental results based on both the benchmark function approximation and real-world problems including classification and regression applications show the good performances of EELM.  Fernandez-Navarro et al. (2011)  propose a methodology for training a new model of artificial neural network called the generalized radial basis function (GRBF) neural network. This model is based on generalized Gaussian distribution, which parameterizes the Gaussian distribution by adding a new parameter \u03c4 . For example, when GRBF takes a value of \u03c4 = 2, it represents the standard Gaussian radial basis function. The model parameters are optimized through a modified version of the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It is a process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups, where each group contains objects which are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and different from those of other groups. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data which have anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, bioinformatics, biology, recommendation systems and the clustering of text documents. Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of their convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based globalized search algorithm that uses the principles of the social behavior of swarms. PSO produces better results in complicated and multi-peak problems. This paper presents a literature survey on the PSO algorithm and its variants to clustering high-dimensional data. An attempt is made to provide a guide for the researchers who are working in the area of PSO and high-dimensional data clustering. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMarini and Walczak (2011)  proposed a discrete binary-coded implementation of the PSO algorithm to identify and select variables with a significant clustering tendency. In particular, to cope with the problems that can arise when performing variable selection on data sets with a high number of variables, and to account for the possibility of using the method also for purely exploratory purposes, an unsupervised approach was used, where the fitness was computed based on hierarchical clustering models. The characteristics of the method were shown on two simulated data sets and on a real megavariate data set coming from the analysis of genomic microarrays. They conclude that in all cases, PSO allowed them to explore different subspaces and to discover meaningful structures in the analyzed data. Based on these considerations, it is apparent that the use of PSO can represent a very promising option to deal with the problem of finding groups in a multivariate data set in a relatively straightforward and reliable way. This approach could be very useful to cope with biomarker identification in the fields of genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. Lotfi  Shahreza et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2009 ). The simulation results on a text dataset shows that this approach effectively improves the quality of clustering and gets better results compared with the K-means algorithm, but is inferior to that on English text clustering because of the features of the Chinese words and the complex grammars.  Cai et al. (2010)  presented schemes for outlier detection in conjunction with clustering using PSO. They concluded that the combined modifications to PSO can speed up the optimization process to the point that it can quickly generate very efficient clustering solutions in large datasets. The running results of the system show that it was feasible and valuable to apply this method to mining the outliers in high-dimensional spectrum data.  Kiranyaz et al. (2010b)  presented a personalized long-term continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) classification system. It is based on multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization (MDPSO) to find out the true number of clusters and fractional global best formation (FGBF) to avoid local optima. To help professionals to quickly and accurately diagnose any latent heart disease, the proposed systematic approach produced results that were consistent with the manual labels with 99.5% average accuracy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2003; Parsons et al. 2004) . Variable selection in clustering has been approached from different perspectives: density-based methods such as  (Agrawal et al. 1998; Chan and Hall 2010; Raftery and Dean 2006) , model-based methods such as  (Pan and Shen 2007; Wang ans Zhu 2008) , and criterion-based methods such as  (Witten and Tibshirani 2010; Raftery and Dean 2006) . Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of the convergence and the sensitivity to initialization values, etc. and they still require much investigation to improve performance and efficiency. Clustering methods such as the K-means algorithm, soft clustering based on mixed models, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering have been developed and have proven to be successful in many real world applications  (Kriegel et al. 2009; Luxburg 2007; Steinbach et al. 2003; Parsons et al. 2004; Zhou and Shi 2011) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It refers to a number of solution approaches that have been employed for CF such as mathematical programming, heuristic and metaheuristic methodologies and artificial intelligence strategies. A comparison and evaluation of all methodologies is attempted and some shortcomings are highlighted. Finally, suggestions for future research are proposed useful for CF researchers. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFinally, some additional components could be included in the future agenda for CF: researchers should focus more on multiple objectives rather than single objectives, the dynamic nature of the CF should be included when more comprehensive models are taken into account reflecting reality; more attention should be given to PSO and ACO as both seem promising methodologies for CF; uncertainty in part/machine utilisation could be studied by employing fuzzy theory; hybrid metaheuristics are powerful tools which should be employed more frequently for complex systems such CF.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMak et al. (2000)  proposed an adaptive genetic approach as an effective means of providing the optimal solution to the CF problem. The objective was to group parts and machines into clusters by sequencing the rows and columns of a part/machine incidence matrix to maximise the bond energy measure of the matrix. The proposed approach was different from the use of traditional GAs, because an adaptive scheme was adopted to adjust the genetic parameters during the genetic search process. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated by applying it to numerical results and a number of benchmark problems obtained from the literature.  Solimanpur et al. (2004a)  formulated a multi-objective integer programming model for the CF problem with independent cells. A GA with multiple fitness functions was proposed to solve their model. Two features made their proposed algorithm differ from previous approaches i.e.: (a) a system-atic uniform design-based technique which was used to determine the search directions, and (b) the search of the solution space in multiple directions instead of a single direction. The results validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is worth noting that these papers were selected to be included in this review as their contribution towards CF covers a large spectrum of research directions over the last ten years. All papers have been classified based on different methodologies employed such as mathematical programming, heuristics/metaheuristics and artificial intelligence approaches and their contribution discussed.

Major objectives are identified as minimisation of intercellular movements, machine/load utilisation and numerous cost considerations such as: machine operating cost, machine modification costs, machine (re)configuration cost, subcontracting cost, machine setup cost, inventory holding cost, replacement costs of defective parts.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this problem, the most popular performance measure is the top precision measure, and the most important component of a retrieval system is the similarity function used to compare a query image against a database image. However, up to now, there is no existing similarity learning method proposed to optimize the top precision measure. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel similarity learning method to maximize the top precision measure. We model this problem as a minimization problem with an objective function as the combination of the losses of the relevant images ranked behind the top-ranked irrelevant image, and the squared Frobenius norm of the similarity function parameter. This minimization problem is solved as a quadratic programming problem. The experiments over two benchmark data sets show the advantages of the proposed method over other similarity learning methods when the top precision is used as the performance measure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOur proposed algorithm MTPS exhibits shorter running time than others, except for the OASIS and OMKS, suggesting that MTPS provides a comparably efficient way against the problem, and shows a promising improvement space for the future work.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\nIn this paper we study the problem of similarity learning for content-based image retrieval. The critical novelty of this work is it learns the similarity to maximize the top precision measure over the training set. We model the learning problem as a support top irrelevant database image weighting problem to obtain the optimal similarity function. The experiments over some benchmark databases show its advantages over other similarity learning methods. In the future, we will investigate to use some other similarity function as similarity measure instead of linear function, such as Bayesian network  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] , and also to develop novel algorithms of other machine learning problems and applications besides similarity learning, to maximize top precision measure, such as importance sampling  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] , portfolio choices  [18] ,  [19] , multimedia technology  [20] ,  [21] ,  [22] ,  [23] ,\n\nExcerpt 2: \n( 5 ) Thus the loss function for each (z i , x j ) i,j:yij =1 is, \u2113(z i , x j ; W ) = max 0, max k:y ik =0 s(z i , x k ) -s(z i , x j ) + 1 = max 0, max k:y ik =0 z \u22a4 i W (x k -x j ) + 1 .

In this paper, we propose a novel image representation method by learning and using kernel classifiers. We firstly train classifiers using the one-against-all rule, then use them classify the candidate images, and finally using the classification responses as the new representations. The Euclidean distance between the classification response vectors are used as the new similarity measure. The experimental results from a large scale image database show that the proposed algorithm can outperform the original feature on image retrieval problem. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch a significant improvement is archived by including the discriminant information provided by the classifier. A much more accurate representation of image is provided by using the kernel classifier trained from the images of different  In figure  5 , the top nine nearest neighbor images of a query image is shown. On the top of the figure, the query image is presented, and the retrieved nearest neighbors are presented below. It is clear that the proposed method can relevant images from the database. We also compare the proposed fast updating algorithm with the original updating one. The training time is given in figure  6 . It is indicated that the proposed algorithm can reduce the training time significantly.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method to represent image using the kernel classifiers. The motivation behind this is that two images are regarded as similar to each other if their response to a classifier are similar. We developed a fast and effective iterative algorithm to train the kernel classifier when the training image number is tremendous. The presented experiment results show the proposed presentation method outperforms the original features. In addition, our methodfig2 reduce the training time eminently.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe write the objective function in  (3)  as O(\u03b1) = 1 2 \u03b1 2 2 + C 1 N N i=1 (f (x i ), y i ) = 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b1 + C 1 N N i=1 \u03b2 i 1 -y i \u03b1 K(\u2022, x i ) (5) \u03b2 i is defined as \u03b2 i = 1, if 1 -y i \u03b1 K(\u2022, x i ) \u2265 0 0, e l s e (6) We try to use the gradient descent method  [43] -  [45]  to update the classifier parameter \u03b1 in an iterative algorithm.

To prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve its color change sensitivity, it was immobilized with polyvinyl alcohol and a high-absorbance material. The color of the pH indicator changes from yellow to blue and finally purple to indicate spoilage, which can be easily detected by the naked eye. The asprepared pH indicator exhibited good response to pH changes on the surface of chicken breast meat, and no migration of the dye from the indicator onto the surface of the chicken was observed. This pH indicator exhibits excellent feasibility for real-time, direct-contact monitoring of the freshness and quality of various foods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor example, the ripening and/or spoilage of meat, which cause a decrease in electrolyte dissociation, an increase in the concentration of buffering proteins, and the formation of ammonia, may be observed in the form of an increase in pH  (12) . Color-based pH indicators have potential for use as indicators of microbial growth and changes in metabolite levels originating from food spoilage and protein degradation for freshness monitoring  (2, 8) . This method can be used for on-package monitoring of food spoilage. For instance, indicators with pH sensitive dyes immobilized onto plastic films or cellulose membranes have been proposed as fish-spoilage indicators  (13, 14) . This methodology works by detecting gradual changes in pH caused by the spoilage of fish, as volatile basic amines evolved into the food package headspace cause an increase in the pH and subsequently the color of the indicator changes from yellow to blue, which is easily detected by the naked eye. Studies using the same principle have been reported by Kuswandi et al.  (2) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs shown in Fig.  1 , the pH indicator in this study was designed as a three-layered structure with a super-absorbent pad, which was used to prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve the color change sensitivity of BCP. The effectiveness of the pH indicator was examined by attaching it to the surface of chicken breasts stored at 4 and 10 o C. The indicator response was correlated with pH, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) content, bacterial growth, and changes in the surface color of the chicken breast. This color-based pH indicator was successfully prepared and tested for the visual monitoring of the real-time freshness of chicken breast in direct contact mode.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials BCP (dye content 90%) as the dye, 98.0-99.5% hydrolyzed PVA (average molecular weight: 17,500 g/mol) as the binder, and filter paper (Whatman TM Filter Paper No. 42; Whatman plc, Maidstone, UK) as the indicator carrier were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MI, USA), OCI Co., Ltd. (Incheon, Korea), and GE Healthcare UK Ltd.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs expected, the as-prepared pH indicator shows good response to pH change on the surface of the chicken breast and accumulation of VBN species during storage. Furthermore, there are no visual differences in color changes between the samples stored at 4 and 10 o C, i.e., the visual color of the pH indicator changes only according to pH on the surface of the chicken breast. No migration of the dye from the indicator onto the surface of the chicken breast is detected after 10 days of storage. This indicates that the BCP dye is successfully entrapped within the highabsorbance materials and filter paper in our system, and that the asprepared pH indicators do not show migration problems in our product-indicator direct-contact system. The pH-responsive color change of the as-prepared indicator shows excellent response to pH change on the surface of the chicken breast and the VBN contents, which are strongly correlated to the proliferation of spoilage microorganisms. Thus, the quick and direct detection of chicken breast spoilage by the pH indicator attached to its surface is highly feasible using the pH responsive freshness indicator developed in this study.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Recent achievements in the synthesis of discrete nano-objects, micellar structures, and periodic nanomaterials from bottlebrush copolymers are emphasized, and future opportunities in this area of polymer science are briefly discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch molecules have been tailored to exhibit specific properties for the utilization as molecular pressure sensors,  23  pH-sensitive molecular probes,  24  supersoft elastomers,  25  and therapeutic delivery vehicles.  [26] [27] [28]   The unique shape and easily controlled dimensions (from tens to hundreds of nanometers) of molecular bottlebrushes render them particularly useful as molecular building blocks for generating nanostructured materials by (  1 ) single-molecule manipulation to create well-defined nano-objects, (2) solution self-assembly to produce larger aggregates with different morphologies, and (3) melt self-assembly to fabricate periodic nanomaterials with large domain spacings. In each of these applications, the peculiar properties of bottlebrush copolymers enable the synthesis of previously inaccessible materials in a controlled and predictable fashion. The molecular templating method based on bottlebrush copolymers combines excellent dimensional control of solid templating methods and scalability of self-assembly approaches to provide a robust platform for the construction of 1D nanoobjects with tunable dimensions (Figure  2 ). A molecular bottlebrush can be viewed as a covalently preassembled cylindrical polymer micelle.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNew synthetic methods for the preparation of more sophisticated bottlebrushes can lead to the development of highly compartmentalized nanoparticles that can address ongoing problems in drug delivery, catalysis, and molecular separations.

We recognize that MendNano is a dynamic model though many aspects in the publication appear to rely primarily on steady state assumptions. As the authors of MendNano, we are sure that Cohen et al. are more familiar with their model than anyone else. Generalizations on our part may be due to limited space. Second, our statement regarding MendNano\u2019s capabilities was not that the model cannot be used to look at different land uses or water types, but rather that from the published works, we were under the impression that only one\ntype can be considered at a time. We did not consider nor state that dissolution is independent of particle size. Rather that, as a screening tool, we chose to limit the complexity required by introducing particle size distribution not unlike other existing models and most MFA models. This necessitated simplifying the calculations so that the amount of data necessary to run the model was manageable. In addition, we felt that modeling dissolution patterns at the individual particle scale when trying to represent a much larger region would not be efficient.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe dissolution equation was written to focus on the loss of the nanoparticle, which is why C is concentration of nanoparticle and not dissolved ion, so the negative is not a typo. In regard to atmospheric dry deposition, we again elected throughout the model not to incorporate a distribution of particle sizes because nanoFate is meant to be a screening level tool. The referenced equation relies on Stoke\u2019s Law5 and is used in nanoFate to calculate deposition of both ENMs associated with aerosols and individual or small aggregates of ENMs of a specified particle size. Particle radius is therefore accounted for in the calculation of both wet and dry deposition in Rp (particle radius), and as with other models that use this equation, if the particles are of varying sizes, then there will be some variability in the predictions. This equation is a reasonable simplification of a rather complex process, which may be improved when better models of atmospheric deposition (wet and dry) of nanoparticles are developed. The primary reason for not explicitly considering multiple particle sizes is due to a lack of experimental data to parametrize the model with realistic particle size distributions for each environment.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAmong other limitations, the fact that, at the time, we did not have realistic distributions of ENM size at the point of release to the environment made it difficult to include particle size in a screening level model. The goal was to holistically and mechanistically consider the most significant processes without making the model too difficult to use. These simplifications are common in environmental modeling and acceptable if clearly communicated and justified scientifically.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, until recently, few studies have examined associations between physical activity and health in young children. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between physical activity and selected health outcomes in children younger than 6 yr.\nMethods: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies examining the associations between physical activity and adiposity/weight status, bone health, cardiometabolic health, and cognition in children younger than 6 yr.\nResults: Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and served as the basis for this systematic review. For weight status/adiposity, 12 of 15 studies found negative associations between physical activity and one or more measures of the outcome. For bone health, 10 articles based on four studies were identified, and nine studies showed stronger bone in more active children. For cardiometabolic health, three studies were identified and findings were limited and inconsistent. For cognition, two systematic reviews were identified and findings were limited. For all four health outcomes, evidence of dose-response relationships and effect modification by demographic factors was very limited.\nConclusions: There is strong evidence indicating that higher amounts of physical activity are associated with better indicators of bone health and with reduced risk for excessive increases in weight and adiposity in children 3 to 6 yr. Evidence was too limited to support conclusions regarding the effects of physical activity on cardiometabolic health and cognition. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe identified articles were independently screened by two reviewers. The full-text of relevant articles was reviewed to include those that met the inclusion criteria. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are presented in Supplementary Material (see Table, SDC 1, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria). Two abstractors independently abstracted data and conducted a quality or risk of bias assessment using the USDA NEL Bias Assessment Tool (BAT) for original research  (9, 10)  and the AMSTAR ExBP for systematic reviews  (11) . Discrepancies in article selection or data abstractions were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer if needed. The protocol for this review was registered with the PROSPERO database (registration ID CRD42018092740). A summary of the bias assessment of the original research articles included in this review is available in the supplementary material [see Tables, SDC 2, Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) Bias Assessment Tool (BAT): Original Research; and SDC 3, AMSTAR ExBP: SR/MA].\n\nResults\n\n\nSearch results.\nA total of 1257 studies were identified through the systematic searches (Figure  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, there is a pressing need for studies among children with elevated levels of risk factors, in addition to the identification of novel cardiometabolic health markers that are sensitive to lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity.\n\nCognition.\nThe study of cognition sits within the broader field of brain health, which is a broad term conceptualized as the optimal or maximal functioning of behavioral and biological measures of the brain including subjective experiences that arise from brain function (e.g., attention, mood). Brain health can be measured using biological markers of the brain (e.g., structural brain morphology) or via subjective manifestations of brain function, including mood and anxiety, perceptions of quality of life, cognitive function (e.g., attention and memory), and sleep. Relative to children under the age of 6 years, little is known regarding the relationship of physical activity to cognition and brain health. The available, preliminary evidence points to a beneficial association of physical activity to cognitive and academic outcomes, which should not be surprising given that findings in studies of older children and adults populations is much further along, and has evidenced benefits to brain structure and function, and a variety of cognitive outcomes.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe study designs, methods, and findings of these studies are summarized in Table  2 . Three of the four studies focused on preschool children (baseline ages 3 to 5)  (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35)  and one study focused on infants  (36) . The dose of physical activity was defined and measured differently among the studies and included recreational gymnastics participation (months)  (28) (29) (30) , device-measured daily activity (min)  (31) (32) (33) (34) , and bone-strengthening physical activity (sessions)  (27, 35, 36) . All studies used state-of-the-art imaging (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)) to measure bone outcomes and appropriate statistical modeling to control for growth. All studies examining children ages 3-5 years showed statistically significant stronger bone in the more active children. The benefit differences were greater than expected via measurement error and large enough (almost always >3%) to indicate meaningful biological improvements.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

One of the many fundamental mathematical discoveries of Ostrowski  [1]  is the following classical integral inequality associated with the differentiable mappings: is the best possible. Ostrowski inequality has applications in quadrature, probability and optimization theory, stochastic, statistics, information, and integral operator theory. During the past few years, a number of scientists have focused on Ostrowski-type inequalities for function of bounded variation, see, for example,  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ,  [12, pp. 468-484] . Until now, a large number of research papers and books have been written on Ostrowski inequalities and their numerous applications. On the other hand, many studies have recently been carried out in the field of q-analysis, starting with Euler due to a high demand for mathematics that models quantum computing q-calculus appeared as a connection between mathematics and physics.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

One way to achieve a sustainable future in urban areas and remote communities is to use the independent renewable energy systems. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common sources of energy generation that has attracted of the world. The present study provides the comprehensive examine the performance of two parabolic dish collector and flat-plate collector from energy, exergy, Enviroeconomic and Exergoenviroeconomic view of points. To examine the performance of solar systems, the climatic conditions of two different cities in Asia (Beijing and Tehran) have been used. In addition, the performance of the systems is investigated under different parameters and using different working fluids and MWCNT nanoparticle. It was found that the both solar systems have better overall performance in Tehran than in Beijing. Moreover, in the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months. In addition, the lowest and highest Levelized Cost of Energy are belong to dish collector (in Tehran with water) and flat plate collector (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively. For Tehran, LCOE of dish collector increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition, the impact of the use of nanofluids on the performance of systems is investigated. Dowtherm Q is a synthetic organic HTF containing a mixture of alkylated aromatics and diphenylethane. Compared to hot oils, it represents better thermal consistency and significantly better low-temperature pump ability.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMWCNT has extraordinary thermal properties and can be widely used industrially and commercially as a new generation of refrigerants and thermal operating fluids. The use of these nanofluids in thermal systems can increase the efficiency and significantly increase the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient in equal Reynolds. This group of nanofluids in different base fluids such as ethylene glycol and water with suitable stability can be provided. The physical properties of the nanofluid should be determined based on the nanoparticle and base fluid physical properties. These properties include viscosity, density, thermal conductivity and specific heat  Ehyaei et al. (2019) . The physical properties of nanofluids can be obtained using the following equations  (Khanjari et al. 2016; Loni et al. 2017; Zadeh et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFig.  12  shows the thermal conductivity of different HTFs versus particle volume fraction. Obviously, by adding nanoparticle to the working fluids, the value of k of the heat transfer fluid increases. For instance, at \u03c6 = 5%, the value of k of water/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.36% higher than that of water. In such a context, the thermal conductivity of the Dowtherm Q/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.42% higher than that of Dowtherm Q. Water heat capacity is higher than Dowtherm Q, so PDC and FPC systems are expected to have better energy and exergy performance when using water. Table  5  presents the temperature difference (in degree) of PDC and FPC with different heat transfer fluids in Tehran and Beijing. Using Dowtherm Q instead of water as the working fluid of solar collectors decreases their outlet temperature. The average temperature difference of the PDC and FPC in Tehran when using Dowtherm Q are decreased by 7.84 and 3.19 degrees, respectively.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Both positive social interactions and stress are known to induce OXT secretion, but the relative influence of either of these triggers is not well delineated. Choir singing is an activity known to improve mood and to induce feelings of social closeness, and may therefore be used to investigate the effects of positive social experiences on OXT system activity. We quantified mood and salivary OXT and cortisol (CORT) concentrations before, during, and after both choir and solo singing performed in a randomized order in the same participants (repeated measures). Happiness was increased, and worry and sadness as well as salivary CORT concentrations were reduced, after both choir and solo singing. Surprisingly, salivary OXT concentrations were significantly reduced after choir singing, but did not change in response to solo singing. Salivary OXT concentrations showed high intra-individual stability, whereas salivary CORT concentrations fluctuated between days within participants. The present data indicate that the social experience of choir singing does not induce peripheral OXT secretion, as indicated by unchanged salivary OXT levels. Rather, the reduction of stress/arousal experienced during choir singing may lead to an inhibition of peripheral OXT secretion. These data are important for the interpretation of future reports on salivary OXT concentrations, and emphasize the need to strictly control for stress/arousal when designing similar experiments. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis hypothesis was based on two lines of reasoning: (i) an earlier study reporting an increase in salivary OXT concentrations (139% of basal) after 30 min of choir rehearsal, including 10 min of warm-up exercises and repeatedly singing the pop-song ''California Dreaming''  (Kreutz, 2014) ; and (ii) reports of other positive social experiences resulting in OXT secretion, such as intense parent-child interactions, massage, gossiping with friends, and loving interactions between participants and their dogs  (Grewen et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2006; Feldman et al., 2010; Beetz et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Tsuji et al., 2015; Krause et al., 2016; Lebowitz et al., 2016; Brondino et al., 2017) . Of course, it may be that positive bilateral interactions or the powerful intimate bond between parents and their children, romantic partners, or dogs and their owners are needed to trigger the OXT system to a quantifiable extent-aspects that are missing from choir singing.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, our findings need to be confirmed in plasma samples. Finally, as for all studies assessing peripheral OXT concentrations, it is important to emphasize that these responses may not correlate with central OXT release in regions relevant for social behaviors, emotionality, and stress regulation  (Neumann and Landgraf, 2012; Neumann and Slattery, 2016) . In other words, the improved mood and feelings of social closeness reported after choir singing may have been caused by subtle release of OXT in distinct brain regions in the absence of measurable increases in peripheral OXT secretion. Taken together, the present results confirm our hypothesis that 20 min of either choir or solo singing improve mood, with choir singing exerting the stronger effects, and does not activate the HPA axis. More surprisingly, choir singing resulted in a marked reduction in salivary OXT concentrations, whereas solo singing modestly increased salivary OXT concentrations. The data presented here challenge the view that during choir singing, elevated levels of peripheral OXT mark the induction of a ''sociobiological bonding response that is similar to those elicited during intimate social relationships''  (Kreutz, 2014) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, OXT is also secreted in response to various kinds of stress  (Pierrehumbert et al., 2010; de Jong et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2016) . Therefore, if stress is not properly controlled for, an increase in peripheral OXT concentrations may be falsely interpreted as a ''pro-social'' rather than a stress response. The current experiment was designed to assess salivary OXT and CORT concentrations in male and female healthy volunteers in response to a positive social challenge: choir singing. In general, choir singing is known to improve mental and physical health and overall quality of life  (Clift et al., 2010; Chanda and Levitin, 2013; Coulton et al., 2015) . A single choir singing session improves mood and increases trust, cooperative behavior, and feelings of social closeness in the singers  (Anshel and Kipper, 1988; Weinstein et al., 2016)  while reducing anxiety and other negative feelings  (Kreutz et al., 2004; Kreutz, 2014; Fancourt et al., 2016) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[citation].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Gap junction gene and protein families: Connexins, innexins, and pannexins \nAbstract: Gap junction channels facilitate the intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules. While this process is critical to all multicellular organisms, the proteins that form gap junction channels are not conserved. Vertebrate gap junctions are formed by connexins, while invertebrate gap junctions are formed by innexins. Interestingly, vertebrates and lower chordates contain innexin homologs, the pannexins, which also form channels, but rarely (if ever) make intercellular channels. While the connexin and the innexin/pannexin polypeptides do not share significant sequence similarity, all three of these protein families share a similar membrane topology and some similarities in quaternary structure. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Gap Junction Proteins edited by Jean Claude Herve. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe connexins, innexins and pannexins all contain cysteines in their extracellular loops, but they differ in the numbers of cysteines in each loop: connexins contain three, whereas innexins and pannexins contain two. The connexins, innexins and pannexins contain an invariant proline residue in the second transmembrane domain. This proline forms part of a motif (PXXXW) that is conserved between vertebrate pannexins and most innexins. The connexins, innexins, and pannexins are all multi-member families; within the families, sequence differences between members confer unique channel and regulatory properties. Both connexins and pannexins participate in several processes including propagation of calcium waves, inflammation, memory consolidation and neurodegeneration. Knowledge of the sequences and structures of the connexins, pannexins, and innexins is facilitating elucidation of their individual, shared, and complementary roles in physiology and pathophysiology. Membrane topology of a connexin/innexin/pannexin.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe connexins form a closely related family exhibiting extensive amino acid identity and similarity within their transmembrane and extracellular domains. The similarities in their extracellular loops can be described by two connexin signatures (PS00407 and PS00408,  http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00341 ). Differences and similarities in the connexin sequences have been used to define connexin subfamilies  [7, 30] , and sequence comparisons between different species have been used to identify orthologs  [18] . Currently, five connexin subfamilies are recognized (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5 or GJA, GJB, GJC, GJD, and GJE) (Table  1 ). A wide range of genetic diseases have been mapped to mutations of the connexin encoding genes (including deafness, neuropathies, cataracts, skeletal abnormalities, and skin diseases) (reviewed in  [9, 31, 37, 38, 46, 48, 53, 55] ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUnlike the connexins, pannexins undergo glycosylation within their extracellular regions. This modification may be important for the targeting of pannexins to the plasma membrane  [11, 39] . Pannexin glycosylation may effectively impede cell-to-cell channel formation and regulate pannexin intermixing  [40] . Some innexins may also be glycosylated; for example, two yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) innexins (AeInx3 and AeInx7) contain predicted N-glycosylation sites, and immunoblots of AeInx3 show multiple immunoreactive bands. This similarity to the pannexins suggests that some innexins might have other functional roles besides intercellular communication  [15] .

In this study, we investigated the role of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel-mediated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in purinergic-mediated disassembly of adherens and tight junction complexes in early tubular injury.\nMethods: Human primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTECs) and clonal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were treated with Transforming Growth Factor Beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) \u00b1 apyrase, or ATP\u03b3S for 48 h. For inhibitor studies, cells were co-incubated with Cx43 mimetic Peptide 5, or purinergic receptor antagonists Suramin, A438079 or A804598. Immunoblotting, single-cell force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assessed protein expression, cell-cell adhesion and paracellular permeability. Carboxyfluorescein uptake and biosensing measured hemichannel activity and real-time ATP release, whilst a heterozygous Cx43+/- mouse model with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) assessed the role of Cx43 in vivo.\nResults: Immunohistochemistry of biopsy material from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed increased expression of purinergic receptor P2X7. TGF-\u03b21 increased Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity and ATP release in hPTECs and HK2 cells. The cytokine reduced maximum unbinding forces and reduced cell-cell adhesion, which translated to increased paracellular permeability. Changes were reversed when cells were co-incubated with either Peptide 5 or P2-purinoceptor inhibitors. Cx43+/- mice did not exhibit protein changes associated with early tubular injury in a UUO model of fibrosis.\nConclusion: Data suggest that Cx43 mediated ATP release represents an initial trigger in early tubular injury via its actions on the adherens and tight junction complex. Since Cx43 is highly expressed in nephropathy, it represents a novel target for intervention of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CKD. Video Abstract In proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), tight junction proteins, including zona occuludens-1 (ZO-1), contribute to epithelial integrity, whilst the adherens junction protein epithelial (E)-cadherin (ECAD) maintains cell-cell coupling, facilitating connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and the direct transfer of small molecules and ions between cells. In disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) binds to its receptor and recruits SMAD2/3 signalling ahead of changes in gene transcription and up-regulation of Cx43-mediated hemichannels (HC). Uncoupled hemichannels permit the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in to the extracellular space (\u2191[ATP]e), where ATP binds to the P2X7 purinoreceptor and activates the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inflammation results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibrosis and tubular injury. A major consequence is further loss of ECAD and reduced stickiness between cells, which can be functionally measured as a decrease in the maximum unbinding force needed to uncouple two adherent cells (Fmax). Loss of ECAD feeds forward to further lessen cell-cell coupling exacerbating the switch from GJIC to HC-mediated release of ATP. Reduction in ZO-1 impedes tight junction effectiveness and decreases trans-epithelial resistance (\u2193TER), resulting in increased paracellular permeability. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPeptide 5 is a 12 amino acid peptide which targets the 2nd extracellular loop of Cx43  [52] , it has been proven successful in blocking Cx43 hemichannels when delivered topically, intraocularly  [53] , into cerbebrospinal fluid and systemically  [52] . Multiple approaches have been used to confirm target applicability and specificity and all have yielded similar and significant benefits across different injury models. The ability of Peptide 5 to block hemichannel activity, ATP-release and ultimately disassembly of the adherens/tight junction complex in our model system, was assessed by carboxyfluorescein dye uptake, ATP-biosensing and Fig.  8  Cx43 +/-mice exhibit minimal disassembly of the adherens and tight junction complex. Quantification of immunohistochemical staining determined an increase in N-cadherin (a & c) and decrease in ZO-1 (b & d) expression in wildtype (WT) UUO compared to WT sham controls. In Cx43 +/-(UUO) mice, expression of both markers was partially restored to near basal levels.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor all experiments, inhibitors alone failed to induce any significant change in expression.\n\nPeptide 5 inhibits TGF-\u03b21-induced Cx43 hemichannel activity and ATP release\nTo study the efficacy of Peptide 5 in blocking Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity in renal tubule epithelial cells, HK2 and hPTECs were incubated in TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/mL) \u00b1 Peptide 5 (25 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Dye uptake increased in TGF-\u03b21-treated HK2 cells to 609.4 \u00b1 46% compared to unstimulated control (Fig.  6a  & b ), whilst co-incubation with Peptide 5 reduced uptake to 163 \u00b1 10.2%. Co-incubation with scrambled peptide failed to blunt the TGF-\u03b21 response (671.5 \u00b1 29.5%, Fig.  6a  & b ). The effects were matched in primary hPTECS, where Peptide 5 significantly reduced uptake to 141.7 \u00b1 16.3% from 311.2 \u00b1 39.6% in TGF-\u03b21 treated cells (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHuman renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were incubated with TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/mL) \u00b1 Peptide 5 (25 \u03bcM) for 48 h.

This family of membrane proteins is the molecular constituent of gap junction channels and hemichannels that provide pathways for direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm and inside-out exchange, respectively. Both types of Cx channels are permeable to ions and small signaling molecules allowing astrocytes to establish dynamic interactions with neurons. So far, most pharmacological approaches currently available do not distinguish between these two channel functions, stressing the need to develop new specific molecular tools. In astrocytes two major Cxs are expressed, Cx43 and Cx30, and there is now evidence indicating that at least Cx43 operates as a gap junction channel as well as a hemichannel in these cells. Based on studies in primary cultures as well as in acute hippocampal slices, we report here that Gap19, a nonapeptide derived from the cytoplasmic loop of Cx43, inhibits astroglial Cx43 hemichannels in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting gap junction channels. This peptide, which not only selectively inhibits hemichannels but is also specific for Cx43, can be delivered in vivo in mice as TAT-Gap19, and displays penetration into the brain parenchyma. As a result, Gap19 combined with other tools opens up new avenues to decipher the role of Cx43 hemichannels in interactions between astrocytes and neurons in physiological as well as pathological situations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPeptides mimicking CL sequences have been frequently used as control peptides for gap junction work, since it was shown that these do not inhibit gap junctional coupling  (Evans and Leybaert, 2007) . Although this specificity has already been reported for the cardiac system  (Wang et al., 2013b)  we think that it is important to validate this property for the nervous system. Indeed, this is particular relevant for the astrocytes because Cx43 hemichannels contribute to \"gliotransmission\" and can thus be involved in neuroglial interactions that participate to the control of neuronal activity and survival (see  Giaume et al., 2013) . In line with this, we found that Gap19 did not inhibit gap junction coupling in astrocytes as measured with dye transfer assays. At the same time, however, Gap19 strongly inhibited Cx43 hemichannels as exemplified by ATP release and dye uptake assays. Finally, we provide evidence that the TAT version of Gap19 is able to cross the intact blood-brain barrier indicating that this peptide can be used to block astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity when applied through a vascular route.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2001;  Decrock et al., 2009) . Similarly, antibodies directed against the EL domains of the Cx protein rapidly inhibit hemichannels but they also display delayed inhibition of gap junction channels by preventing the processes of hemichannel docking and de novo gap junction channel formation  (Orellana et al., 2011; Riquelme et al., 2013) . In some cases, distinctive effects on hemichannels and gap junctions depend on the concentration at which they are applied: peptide5, which contains a sequence that comprises part of the Gap27 domain (SRPTEKT), inhibits hemichannels at low (5 \u03bcM) concentration while combined gap junction/hemichannel block is only observed at high (500 \u03bcM) concentration  (O'carroll et al., 2008) . Here, we describe the effect on astroglial hemichannels of a peptide, named Gap19, that is identical to a short sequence present on the intracellular CL domain of Cx43 (Figure  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFinally, the effects of Gap19 on hemichannel activity reported here are similar to those previously described for Gap26 and Gap27 that also blocks hemichannel activity in astrocytes induced by LPS or pro-inflammatory treatments in culture astrocytes (see  Retamal et al., 2007; Froger et al., 2010)  and in acute brain slices treated with the amyloid peptide  (Orellana et al., 2011) . have also published that carbenoxolone blocks hemichannel activity induced by a calcium free solution  (Rouach et al., 2008, Supplementary Data Figure S5) . The in vivo injection experiments demonstrate that TAT-Gap19 can be detected in the brain tissue, based on immunostaining for the TAT moiety of the peptide (Figure  4 ). This observation indicates that TAT-Gap19 can successfully cross the blood-brain barrier, which is expected as a result of the presence of the TAT membrane translocation motif. We did not quantify the immune signal in terms of estimates of the concentration attained.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Surgical repair remains the operation of choice; however, the outcome often is poor. We investigated the ability of injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a preclinical model.\nMethods: Twenty-four inbred Wistar Furth rats were divided into three groups. As a control, Group A underwent sham operation. Group B had sphincterotomy and repair of both anal sphincters plus saline injections. The study group (Group C) underwent sphincterotomy and repair followed by intrasphincteric injections of syngenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. A further group (Group D) of outbred Wistar rats treated with mesenchymal stem cells and immunosuppressive therapy also was evaluated. At 30 days, histologic and morphometric analysis and in vitro contractility testing was performed.\nResults: A significant decrease of muscle tissue was observed at the site of repair after sphincter injury. However, in Groups C and D, histologic examination demonstrated new muscle fibers and morphometric analysis revealed a significantly greater muscle area fraction than in Group B (P < 0.05). Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells injection improved contractility of sphincters strips compared with Group B (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between Groups C and D.\nConclusions: In our experimental model, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells injection improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after injury and repair. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells may represent an attractive tool for treating anal sphincter lesions in humans. Investigations into the biologic basis of this phenomenon should increase our knowledge on underlying mechanisms involved in sphincter repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n42, 43  Thus, additional studies will be necessary in the future to examine and compare different stem cells proposed to anal sphincter repair after injury.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides an experimental basis for potential future clinical application of stem cells therapy for anal sphincter injuries. Stem cells could be injected at the moment of surgical repair or percutaneously by ultrasonographic guide in selected injured areas and improve the regeneration and the healing of damaged anal sphincters. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm and expand our preliminary results before attempting this in the clinical setting.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe skin wound was closed with absorbable interrupted suture.\n\nHistologic Evaluation\nA ring specimen, including the anal canal and the terminal rectum, was removed en bloc and rapidly fixed by immersion in Karnovsky reagent (4 percent paraformaldehyde, 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M of cacodylate buffer, pH 7.35) for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in methacrylate (Technovit 7100, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Werheim/TS, Germany).

Electron microscopy shows degeneration of elastic and collagen fibres in necrobiotic areas.'*^''' Vascular changes are few.\"* A cell-mediated immune reaction has been implicated with the demonstration of increased numbers of T helper/inducer lymphocytes within the granulomatous infiltrate, an increased number of 0KT6 positive Langerhans cells within epidermis and dermis, and increased HLA-DR antigen and interleukin 2 receptor expression.' ^ The increased numbers of S100 positive cells in granuloma annulare lends some support to these findings, but the numbers are higher in necrobiosis Hpoidica and other known type IV delayed hypersensitivity reactions.\"^ In conclusion, an increase in the number of epidermal dendritic Sioo positive cells above the basal layer, as well as implicating a cell mediated immune-reaction, may provide an adjunct to histological means of distinguishing between necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNone of the eight patients with granuloma annulare were known to be diabetic.\n\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough clinically different, the similarity of the histological features of granuloma annulare and necrobiosis lipoidica raises the possibility of a common pathogenesis. We have determined the dendritic S100 protein positive subset of the Langerhans cell population in the epidermis in these two conditions. There was a significantly higher number of Sioo positive dendritic cells within the epidermis, above the basal layer, in necrobiosis lipoidica compared with both normal skin and granuloma annulare. In the latter the numbers of cells were elevated, but not to a significant level above normal. This suggests that the pathogenesis of the two conditions may be different. We have found that the numbers of Sioo positive epidermal dendritic cells are elevated to a similar level to that seen in necrobiosis lipoidica in sarcoidosis, positive Kveim test biopsies, tuberculous leprosy and other tuberculous reactions (unpublished data).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThere was no disparity between the histological and clinical diagnoses in any of the cases. All showed the recognized features of collagen degeneration, some having palisaded granulomas. In the majority, the full thickness of the biopsy that included the tower reticular dermis was involved by the lesions. Dendritic cells were seen positively stained, lying between keratinocytes, within the epidermis (Fig.  i ). There was an increase in numbers of epidermal dendritic Sioo positive cells in both granuloma annulare (mean 80) and necrobiosis lipoidica (mean 24 5), compared with normal skin controls (mean 37) (see Table  i} . The numbers were higher in necrobiosis lipoidica than granuloma annulare (o 001 > P > 0 0005); but there was no statistical difference between granuloma annulare and the control group (015 > P>oio).  Of the seven patients with necrobiosis lipoidica one had diabetes mellitus and the number of SIOO positive dendritic cells within this patient's biopsy was in the same range as the remaining six.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) and other antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were tested for by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. Positive results for Scl 70 antibodies were obtained in 77% of cases of diffuse scleroderma and 44% of acrosclerosis. ACA and Scl 70 antibodies were found to be mutually exclusive. If acrosclerosis cases positive for anticentromere antibodies are excluded, the percentage of acrosclerosis cases positive for Scl 70 was 63%. ACA were found to be a marker of a benign, abortive subset of acrosclerosis with almost no cutaneous involvement (CREST), whereas Scl 70 did not discriminate between acrosclerosis and diffuse scleroderma. On HEp-2 cells Scl 70 positive sera gave a characteristic, fine speckled, almost homogeneous nuclear staining pattern. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDISCUSSION\nScl 70 antibody was found to be a specific serological marker of systemic scleroderma. In our series it was detected at a much higher frequency than reported in previous publications  (Tan et al., 1980; Catoggio et al., 1983) , but comparable results have been reported recently by  Takehara, Moroi and Ishibashi (t985) . The higher detection rates of Scl 70 in our study,  77\",, in 13652133, 1986, 4 , Downloaded from  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j .  1365-2133.1986.tb06233. x by Hochschule Mannheim, Wiley Online Library on [05/03/2025].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, it is conceivable that Scl 70 antibody occurs even more frequently than detected in our study. In contrast to ACA antibody, which is a marker of an abortive subset of acrosclerosis with almost no cutaneous indurations  (Chorzelski et al., 1985) , Scl 70 is a marker of systemic sclerosis as a whole, with prevalence in diffuse scleroderma, but present also in a high proportion of cases of acrosclerosis. Thus, it does not discriminate between the subsets of systemic scleroderma. There were only slight clinical differences between cases positive and negative for Scl 70. In patients with acrosclerosis negative for Scl 70, the indurations were confined more frequently to the fingers and there were fewer contractures of the fingers; calcinosis was found in a somewhat larger proportion of the patients, and there was no induration or atrophy on the trunk; the disease was thus less severe than in patients positive for Scl 70 antibody. In patients with diffuse scleroderma the clinical differences between patients positive and those negative for Scl 70 were less conspicuous.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis was diluted t: 128 to contain 5 units/ml.\n\nRESULTS\nScl 70 antibody appeared significantly more frequently in diffuse scleroderma (77\",, of patients) than in acrosclerosis (44\",,) {P < 005; Table  i ). The controls were negative, with the exception of two patients with MCTD (Table  2 ), both falling within the spectrum of systemic sclerosis (pronounced Raynaud's phenomenon with indurative oedema of the hands, mask-like facies Maria Jarzabek-Chorzelska et al with thinning ofthe lips and, in one, diminished oesophageal motility). Thus, Scl 70 appears to be highly specific of systemic sclerosis. Patients with acrosclerosis positive for ACA were invariably negative for Scl 70 (Table  3 ). Conversely, patients with acrosclerosis negative for ACA were found to be positive for Scl 70 in 63\"(, cases, whereas in acrosclerosis patients as a whole Scl 70 antibody was present in 44\",, ofthe cases (Table  1 ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These include TGF-\u03b1, a-FGF, b-FGF, PDGF, TGF-\u00df, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, NGF, TNF-ct, ILla, IL-l\u00df, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and MCSF.[citation 24]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The Biology of Skin Grafts \nAbstract: Background: Skin grafting is commonly used to treat nonhealing wounds. However, how skin grafts help to heal wounds is not entirely known. Why epithelium from grafted skin is able to migrate and cover these wounds, while epithelium at the edge of nonhealing wounds is unable to, is a long unanswered biologic question.\nObservations: The recent use of cultured epithelial allografts has rekindled interest in the biology of skin grafts. Replaced, even in chronic wounds, by recipient epithelium, cultured epithelial allografts appear to work by providing a potent stimulus to healing imparted by the graft itself. Based on this, we have reassessed how skin autografts help to heal wounds and hypothesize that, in a similar fashion, autografts may work not only by replacing tissue but also by providing a stimulus for healing.\nConclusions: We suggest that skin grafts may work not only as tissue replacement but as pharmacologic agents that provide a stimulus for healing. We believe that, someday, it may be possible to augment the stimulatory properties of donor skin to speed healing of the recipient wound. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nToward that end, Beele and coworkers22 were recently successful in treating chronic leg ulcers with repeated cultured epi\u00ac dermal allografts, suggesting that repeated \"doses\" are needed in some patients to aid in wound healing. They noted healing from the edge with each successive graft. It is possible that traditional skin grafting using the patient's own skin without in vitro expansion may work, in part, due to growth factors supplied by the patient's own healthy donor skin. The donor skin transplanted to a nonhealing chronic wound may bring with it factors or the capacity to elaborate factors ab\u00ac sent or deficient in the recipient area. Possibly, the stratum corneum, which is known to act as a reser\u00ac voir,23 or other cells in the grafted tissue, may act as a transport for needed endogenous \"growth factors.\" It is well known that acute wounds produce growth fac\u00ac tors that stimulate healing.24 These factors supplied by the newly grafted skin may significantly contribute to the eventual healing of the wound. In addition, the newly grafted skin may serve to stimulate matrix for\u00ac mation or the release of inflammatory mediators.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, cultured allografts do not ultimately survive transplantation. However, they do seem able to pro\u00ac vide a potent stimulus to healing when placed on a wound. Interestingly, in chronic wounds previously refractory to treatment, the use of cultured kerati- nocyte allografts causes rapid healing even in the face of graft failure. Leigh and coworkers6 felt that host reepithelialization seen after allografting was caused by soluble \"growth factors,\" and this was clinically ap\u00ac parent by \"an effect on the edge of the ulcer which starts to grow in rapidly.\"6 Other authors8,19 have noted this so-called edge effect, and some have also ex\u00ac pressed the idea that the epithelial cells elaborate growth factors responsible for the rapid reepithelial\u00ac ization of the wounds.20,21 If, as it appears, growth fac\u00ac tors are in some way responsible for the rapid healing of chronic ulcers after cultured epithelial allografting, then perhaps \"dosing\" of these growth factors with re- peated grafts may be important.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOver the past decade, cells grown in the laboratory through tissue culture techniques have been used to treat acute and chronic wounds. In 1981, O'Conner et al2 published the first data on the use of cultured expanded autologous (derived from self) epithelial cell sheets in the treatment of large wounds in burn patients. This event heralded the beginning of using cultured cells as skin grafts. However, the idea for us\u00ac ing sheets of cultured cells for grafting may have begun many years earlier. In 1907, Harrison, a biologist, showed that individual cells were capable of life outside the body in which they had grown,3 and, by the middle of this century, epithelial and epidermal cells had been grown in culture. Pickerill,3 with extreme foresight, crystallized the idea of cultured skin grafts in 1951.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The location of the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. relative to the ostium of the celiac trunk was identified on the aortic wall. Following this, the locations of the ostia of the renal aa. on the internal wall of the abdominal aorta were examined relative to the ostia of the arteries mentioned earlier. The ostium of the superior mesenteric a. was usually localized on the inferior-fight side of the ostium of the celiac trunk. The mean value of the distance between the ostia was 17.9 mm. The ostium of the right renal a. was more cranial than the ostium of the left renal a. (53.3%). However, the ostia of both right and left renal aa. were at the same level in three cases (10%). Locations of the ostia of the renal aa. were usually on the lateral and anterolateral regions of the aortic wall.

Our findings were more compatible with the findings of Odman and Ranniger, since the incidence of lateral and anterolateral locations were 48.3% and 31.6%, respectively. According to Odman and Ranniger, the ostium of the right renal a. was located more on the anterior wall and that of the left renal a. on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta. These authors also reported that renal aa. originating from the anterior wall had a more cranial position near the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. [ 10]. We found that renal ostia on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta had a cranial, but ostia on the anterolateral wall a caudal position.\n\nExcerpt 2: \non the internal aortic wall is shown in Figure  3 .

According to our findings, the locations of the arteries on the aortic wall were as shown in Figure  2 .\n\nDiscussion\nDifferent studies dealing with the sites of origin of the renal aa. from the abdominal aorta were reviewed in the literature. However, the results of these studies depended only upon external observations and not on identification of the ostia of the renal aa. from within the aorta.

We re-examine a breccia pipe in the Bushveld Complex to investigate the role of volatile fluid overpressure in its emplacement. This 10-m-diameter breccia pipe was emplaced vertically in the anorthosite of the Upper Critical Zone of the Bushveld Complex and contains blocks of Bushveld anorthosite, norite, and pyroxenite, apparently derived from lower in the stratigraphy. The blocks are commonly elongate, and are tightly packed within an ultramafic pegmatite groundmass. Ultramafic pegmatitic dikes radiate bilaterally from the pipe. Microprobe analyses of plagioclase in the breccia pipe blocks reveal that these grains are unzoned and have higher anorthosite content (~An85) than host rock plagioclase (~An75), indicating that the breccia pipe blocks were transported considerable vertical distances. Whole-rock major- and trace-element data show enrichment in fluid-soluble incompatible elements, supporting the role of volatile fluids in the formation of the pipe. A model is examined in which the segregation of a fluid phase from interstitial liquids in the cumulate section below the breccia pipe leads to the development of sufficient overpressure for its explosive emplacement. Fluid overpressure can develop by compaction and during crystallization of plagioclase-saturated silicate liquids as fluids exsolve from the solidifying interstitial liquid. If fluids separate faster than they can escape from the crystal pile, significant overpressures can develop. The minimum fluidization velocity which would be required to emplace blocks of the size and density found within the breccia pipe is found to be 10\u2013110 m/s. The crystallization model predicts the development of about 400 bar of overpressure, an amount calculated to be sufficient for pipe emplacement. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDevelopment of overpressure from crystallization\nFluid overpressure can develop by a combination of two processes: (1) compaction of the crystal pile, such that any interstitial fluid supports a lithostatic load in excess of the hydrostatic pressure on the fluid, and (2) crystallization overpressure and fluid separating from an interstitial liquid which cannot escape from the crystal pile as fast as it is being generated. In the following we examine the second cause in more detail. As anhydrous minerals crystallize from a vapor-saturated liquid, separation of a volatile-rich fluid must occur. This can lead to an overpressured situation. For example,  Burnham (1979)  has shown how differentiation-induced redistribution of water in a magma body can lead to local vapor saturation and to the rapid upward migration of the vapor. Furthermore, the effect of degassing a fluid on magma pressures and on the eruption behavior of a shallow magma chamber has been examined by  Tait et al. (1989) .  Boudreau (1992)  broadened the discussion of the physical effects of the exsolution of a volatile phase by examining how degassing may cause overpressure in a solidifying crystal pile.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFluid saturation in the interstitial liquid of the crystal pile occurs after volatile concentrations are increased in the liquid as the result of the crystallization of anhydrous phases. The net volume change on crystallization is usually negative  (Peterson 1987) , leading to a net contraction but, when fluids are exsolved and plagioclase crystallizes, the net volume change is positive and a crystallization overpressure develops. This overpressure is in addition to any overpressure from derived compaction in the crystallizing pile. Thus, as seen in Fig.  12 , the base of the chamber comprises solid degassed cumulates, with no porosity. This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others. Fluids are likely to collect in those rocks which have significant residual porosity. These gas-rich regions may be interconnected via pegmatitic channel ways and fractures. Conversely, rocks with low permeability can act as ''caps'' preventing the escape of fluids. When an escape channel does develop, the fluid escapes violently. The presence of ring fractures suggests the exposed host rock (as with the blocks themselves) was significantly solidified such that the fracturing was not annealed subsequent to pipe formation. This suggests that the fluid-source region was gasrich and silicate-liquid poor.\n\nConclusions\nThis study supports earlier contentions that exsolved fluids can create significant overpressures in a solidifying crystal pile  (Burnham 1979; Boudreau 1992) . Furthermore, we add to the growing body of work supporting the importance of exsolved fluids migrating upwards as they harvest and concentrate any PGE which may be present in layered intrusions.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Because the liver is susceptible to toxin- or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth. Specifically, in response to injury, quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and undergo DNA replication to promote liver regrowth. Despite the elucidation of a number of regenerative factors, the mechanisms by which liver injury triggers hepatocyte proliferation are incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that eosinophils stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and toxin-mediated injury. Liver injury results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to promote the proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Surprisingly, signaling via the IL-4R\u03b1 in macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue repair, is dispensable for hepatocyte proliferation and liver regrowth after injury. Instead, IL-4 exerts its proliferative actions via IL-4R\u03b1 in hepatocytes. Our findings thus provide a unique mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMoreover, our work has elucidated a direct mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 signals via the hepatocyte IL-4R\u03b1 to stimulate liver regeneration. In broad terms, these findings suggest that activation of type 2 immunity is integrally linked to reparative and regenerative programs in tissues, thereby exemplifying the host's protective strategy of tolerance against tissue damage  (8, 32) . In support of this idea, we recently reported that eosinophil-derived IL-4 facilitates muscle regeneration  (11) . Last, the ability of IL-4 to induce cell cycle progression in hepatocytes and protect against toxin-mediated injury has potential clinical implications for augmenting liver growth and regeneration in patients with liver disease. Our studies differ in a number of important ways from a recent report that demonstrated a role for IL-4 in liver regeneration  (23) . First, using homozygous KN2 mice that lack IL-4 (24), we failed to detect any differences in liver's regenerative response to injury. A substantial defect in liver regeneration was observed in IL-4/IL-13 knockout mice, which suggests that functional redundancy between IL-4 and IL-13 accounts for these discrepant results.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe liver is a central organ for the synthesis and storage of nutrients, production of serum proteins and hormones, and breakdown of toxins and metabolites.

Rather, type 2 cytokines stimulate liver regeneration, in part, via activation of the IL-4R\u03b1 on hepatocytes.\n\nResults\nEosinophils Are Recruited to the Liver After Hepatic Injury. To identify potential immune cells that participate in liver regeneration, we examined the immune cell repertoire of regenerating livers. Injury induced by partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) led to a dramatic increase in the recruitment of innate immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Figs. S1 A and B, and S2), which coincided with the onset of hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the content of adaptive immune cells did not change significantly in these models of liver injury (Figs.

The Catalog includes 1751 curated publications of 11 912 SNPs. In addition to the SNP-trait association data, the Catalog also publishes a quarterly diagram of all SNP-trait associations mapped to the SNPs' chromosomal locations. The Catalog can be accessed via a tabular web interface, via a dynamic visualization on the human karyotype, as a downloadable tab-delimited file and as an OWL knowledge base. This article presents a number of recent improvements to the Catalog, including novel ways for users to interact with the Catalog and changes to the curation infrastructure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis association between the degenerative disease and inflammation pathways has since been verified in other studies and is now showing promising results as a therapeutic target  (2) . Recent discovery of shared loci in diseases previously thought not to have any common aetiology include gene CDKN2A/B in type II diabetes mellitus (3) and myocardial infarction  (4)  and CDKAL1 in Crohn's disease  (5)  and type II diabetes mellitus  (6) . GWAS data are typically reported in peer-reviewed publications as single studies or meta-analyses, and data deposited in resources such as the European Genomephenome Archive ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega ), or dbGaP  (7) , where users must apply for access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data and comply with a data access agreement. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Catalog of Published GWAS Catalog provides a publicly available manually curated collection of all published GWAS conforming to eligibility criteria including number of SNPs assayed and non-targeted study design. The eligibility criteria are public and available at  http://www.genome.gov/ 27529028    (8) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nINTRODUCTION\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) assay at minimum hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify associations with complex clinical conditions and phenotypic traits. Unlike single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease, complex diseases are usually the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, each of which increases susceptibility to the condition. In the absence of a single causative variant, GWAS aim to identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with a gene or other regulatory element that might contain a causal variant contributing to a condition's aetiology. GWAS are non-candidate genedriven and use a whole-genome approach in large studies of up to hundreds of thousands of individuals investigating traits such as disease, response to drug and anthropometry  (1) . The importance of GWAS in advancing scientific understanding of disease mechanisms and providing starting points for the development of medical treatments is well established. One of the first GWAS identified a polymorphism in complement factor H, part of complement-mediated inflammation, in a study on age-related macular degeneration.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis in turn allows for much richer querying than simple string searching. Mapping to ontologies also greatly facilitates data integration across heterogeneous data sources such as data extracted from the scientific literature. Until recently, the traits in the GWAS Catalog were available as an unstructured flat list, allowing only querying through direct string matching and therefore limiting the Catalog's potential, both as a stand-alone resource and as an integral part of a wider network of genomic resources. Producing consistent high-quality phenotype mappings represents an essential yet challenging task. There is a high level of variation between studies in what constitutes a phenotype and how a phenotype is described. For example, a specific phenotype or disease may be studied explicitly or a phenotype considered to be a marker for disease, e.g. measurements of blood glucose concentration and body weight as risk factors for type II diabetes. To allow consistent groupings of studies and comparisons of results among studies, it is essential that all mappings are consistent but without making potentially incorrect assumptions. For example, a study exploring the effect of SNP level variation on blood glucose levels may use this as a risk indicator for type II diabetes, but unless this is explicitly stated a mapping to type II diabetes would be incorrect.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These include nanobainite steel [citation 36].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The role of retained austenite on tensile properties of steels with bainitic microstructures \nAbstract: In high-carbon, silicon-rich steels it is possible to obtain a very fine bainitic microstructure by transformation at low temperatures (200\u2013300\u00b0C). This microstructure consists of slender ferrite plates, with thicknesses of several tens of nm, in a matrix of retained austenite. Whereas strength is mainly provided by to the fine scale of the ferrite plates (stronger phase), ductility is mostly controlled by the retained austenite (softer phase). Further improvement in ductility is achieved by strain induced transformation of austenite to martensite, the so called TRIP effect. In order to take full advantage of this effect, the mechanical stability of the austenite, i.e., its capability to transform to martensite under strain, must not be too low nor excessively high.\nTwo main aspects of the mechanical stability of the retained austenite, morphology and chemical composition, have been studied to determine the role that these play on the ductility behaviour of the bainitic steels studied. It is suggested that the chemical composition has the strongest effect on the ductility of these new high strength alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFigure  4  represents the strength vs. total elongation for bainitic steels from the literature  [23] [24] [25]  and for those studied in this work. It can be clearly seen that the tensile properties reported in this work has never before been achieved in bainitic steels. It has been suggested  12)  that in this type of low temperature bainitic microstructures the main strengthening mechanism is intimately related to the very small thickness of the ferrite plates and to its high dislocation density. The former gives the largest contribution, up to 1.6 GPa, while a maximum of 500 MPa is estimated to be provided by the dislocation density.  26)  On the other hand, ductility seems to be controlled by the amount of retained austenite, which is the softest phase present in the microstructure.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRegarding total elongation, significant differences are found between both steels. In alloy 1 increasing the test temperature produces an increase of the total elongation by 17 percentage units, while for the Co-Al alloy the increase is less than 2 percentage units, see Table  4 . Following the evolution of the incremental work hardening in Fig.  9 , it is possible to assure that in both alloys retained austenite becomes more stable when compared with the room temperature experiments. After an initial rapid increase to high n values and subsequent decrease, both alloys exhibit, at about 0.045 of true plastic strain, a minimum prior to a continuous increase. These results confirm that the retained austenite in alloy 2 is indeed mechanically too stable, which inhibits taking full advantage of its beneficial effect on ductility.\n\nConclusions\nHigh-carbon, silicon-rich steels with bainitic microstructures obtained by transformation at very low temperatures (200-300 C) were tested in order to characterise their mechanical properties. The obtained microstructures exhibit an extraordinary combination of tensile properties, which has never before been achieved in bainitic steels.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction\nBy means of phase transformation theory for the bainite reaction, high-carbon, silicon-rich steels have been developed  1, 2)  with bainite transformation temperatures as low as T=T m \u00bc $ 0:25, where T m is the absolute melting temperature. The resulting microstructure consists of aggregates of fine plates of bainitic ferrite separated by untransformed carbonenriched austenite. The aggregates of plates are called sheaves, whereas the plates within each sheaf are defined as subunits; the subunits within the same sheaf share a common crystallographic orientation. Thus, two retained austenite morphologies exist: thin films between ferritic subunits and blocks separating the sheaves. Carbide precipitation is avoided by the judicious use of silicon as an alloying element. This mixed microstructure presents an ideal balance of mechanical properties from many points of view. Due to the absence of fine carbides, the steels have a high resistance to cleavage fracture and void formation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consequently, we developed new formalisms from known acid and Mg2+ dissociation constants by which the observed chemical shift of Pi, deltaPi, and the peak height ratio of the beta- and alpha-ATP resonances, hbeta/alpha, could be related to free [Mg2+] by simultaneous solution of: [equation: see text] We found that hbeta/alpha changed 2.5-fold as free [Mg2+] varied from 0.25 to 1.5 mM, providing a more sensitive and accurate measure of free cytosolic [Mg2+].

Earth system science for global sustainability: grand challenges \nAbstract: nan \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMost current efforts to build state-of-theart whole-Earth system models depart from sophisticated geophysical kernels (coupled atmosphere-ocean models based on exact dynamical equations like Navier-Stokes) that are to be complemented by equally powerful tools (once they become available) representing other parts of the planetary makeup. But, for instance, there is no marine-biosphere model available that will match the standards of the fl uid-dynamics-based simulators of the atmosphere within the next 5 years, and the situation seems to be even worse when it comes to simulation of economic, social, and cultural processes. Thus, alternative approaches need to be explored, such as distributed simulators, where available models for all relevant Earth system compartments are virtually assembled from institutions around the world, even if those sectoral models differ heavily in predictive power, or an ensembles approach, where a given Earth system module would be represented by an entire set of credible realizations. Research is also needed to assess the potential impact of environmental changes on regional economic conditions, food security, water supplies, health, biodiversity, and energy security.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nInsights into how best to attain such international policies can be drawn from innovations at local and regional levels, which are important laboratories for assessing how diverse carbon policies affect economic and social development at multiple scales. Just as countries seek to harmonize public sector research, economic incentives for emerging industries, and public policies to stimulate growth of new competitive industries, a mix of incentives will be needed to generate ideas and technologies to address global change in the context of sustainable development. In particular, we need focused efforts, coupled with careful assessment, on such issues as the potentials and risks of geoengineering strategies (including exploration of local to global institutional arrangements needed to oversee them) and options to meet competing demands for scarce land and water over the next half-century.\n\nA Call to Action\nThese grand challenges provide an overarching research framework to mobilize the international scientifi c community around a focused decade of research to support sustainable development in the context of global environmental change. This will require new research capacity, including efforts to attract young scientists, particularly in developing countries. Research dominated by the natural sciences must transition toward research involving the full range of sciences and humanities. A more balanced mix of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research is needed that actively involves stakeholders and decision-makers.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFurthermore, research is needed to understand how people are likely to respond to such changes in different sociogeographic and cultural contexts, in particular in poor and vulnerable communities. Develop, enhance, and integrate observation systems to manage global and regional environmental change. Although investments are being made to build and coordinate more effective observation systems (e.g., the Global Earth Observation System of Systems), current systems fall short of addressing the grand challenges and meeting decision-makers' needs for forecasts and other research products. Economic and social science data, for example, are often gathered and reported at scales that are incompatible for analyzing interlinkages between social and natural systems. The paucity of empirical data on changes in social-environmental systems undermines the ability of decisionmakers and the public to establish appropriate responses to emerging threats and address the needs of vulnerable groups. \n\nPOLICYFORUM\nmanage disruptive global environmental change. Human interference will likely trigger highly nonlinear changes in the global environment that will tend to alter the very character of the life-support system in question and be largely irreversible on human time scales.

We assess the biophysical option space for feeding the world in 2050 in a hypothetical zero-deforestation world. We systematically combine realistic assumptions on future yields, agricultural areas, livestock feed and human diets. For each scenario, we determine whether the supply of crop products meets the demand and whether the grazing intensity stays within plausible limits. We find that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without deforestation, even at low crop-yield levels. Within the option space, individual scenarios differ greatly in terms of biomass harvest, cropland demand and grazing intensity, depending primarily on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human diets. Grazing constraints strongly limit the option space. Without the option to encroach into natural or semi-natural land, trade volumes will rise in scenarios with globally converging diets, thereby decreasing the food self-sufficiency of many developing regions. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRecent studies suggest that providing sufficient food without cropland expansion is possible  17  , for example, by increasing yields above the current rates  18  , based on higher agricultural inputs and associated with massive trade volumes  19  . In contrast, other studies argue that low-input farming systems, such as organic agriculture, are vital for safeguarding important ecosystem services  [20] [21] [22]  . Whether and under which conditions low-input or organic agricultural systems are able to feed the world is fiercely debated  23, 24  , warranting further investigation  25  . In the context of studies assessing the strategies of land-based climate-change mitigation, the future development of human diets  26, 27  and efficiency gains in global livestock systems  [28] [29] [30] [31]  have been identified as crucial. However, because of their large feed requirements, efficiency gains in livestock systems that are based on the enhanced use of croplandderived concentrate feedstuff can also aggravate land competition for food production  8, 28, 32  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe find that the reduction in selfsufficiency associated with the MEAT diet cannot, or can only partly, be compensated for by strategies that aim at ubiquitously closing currently prevailing yield gaps on cropland  19  , a strategy identified as instrumental to warranting food security and to reducing biomass harvest and cropland demand on the global scale  8, 16, 41, 47  . Massive cropland expansion into grazing land could mitigate this trade-off (Supplementary Table  9 ). Our analysis reveals that this could reduce import dependencies in some regions, but it would do so at the expense of encroachment of farming into semi-natural or natural land, which is associated with considerable socio-ecological costs  48  . Note that our results do not assume any trade barriers because they were calculated as the biomass trade flows that would be required to compensate for regional deficits in biomass supply. Socioeconomic barriers or obstacles to biomass trade, which could result from subsidy systems, tariffs or other regulations, could narrow the options space by rendering more scenarios unfeasible.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, it is important to note that livestock provides many services other than food, for example, draught power, nutrient management and risk avoidance. For instance, livestock enables the use of land that cannot be used for cropping due to harsh environmental conditions and thus helps broaden society's resource base  33, 34, 43  . This effect becomes visible in our analysis in scenarios that combine low yields with little cropland expansion. In such contexts, diets relatively high in ruminant products show advantages over the monogastric-based variants. With increased cropland production, however, this advantage of ruminant livestock is lost. Yields show a smaller effect than human diets on the overall option space, but low yield levels limit the number of feasible scenarios, particularly for diets with meat, which are affected primarily by cropland constraints. In this vein, our results suggest  that even in a zero-deforestation world, low-yielding agriculture such as organic farming is a feasible option if paired with a vegetarian or vegan diet, or, to a lesser extent, if based on a massive cropland expansion, adding a nuanced perspective to this controversy  [23] [24] [25]  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Combined with their antigen presentation capacity, this powerful functionality enables pDCs to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. pDCs combine features of both lymphocytes and classical dendritic cells and display unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and IFN production. In the decade since the identification of the pDC as a distinct immune cell type, our understanding of its molecular underpinnings and role in immunity has progressed rapidly. Here we review select aspects of pDC biology including cell fate establishment and plasticity, specific molecular mechanisms of pDC function, and the role of pDCs in T cell responses, antiviral immunity, and autoimmune diseases. Important unresolved questions remain in these areas, promising exciting times in pDC research for years to come. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFurthermore, the isolation of human pDCs based on their specific marker BDCA-2 (an inhibitory receptor) impairs their IFN production capacity. To boost the frustratingly low pDC numbers in mice, many studies inject a Flt3 ligand (Flt3L)-expressing melanoma cell line  (40) . This approach should be discouraged because the resulting gross tumor and supraphysiological Flt3L levels likely affect pDC ground state and functionality. Another practical consideration involves gene targeting in mice: Some Crerecombinase-expressing deleter strains such as the T cell-specific CD4-Cre strain mediate efficient off-target recombination in pDCs  (41) . Thus, a careful analysis of recombination in pDCs is required to exclude its potential contribution to the phenotype in conditional targeting experiments.\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF pDCs\nWe have recently reviewed the developmental origin and transcriptional control of the pDC lineage (6). Here we provide a brief update and highlight several issues that await resolution in future studies. Some of the points discussed below are incorporated into the proposed scheme of pDC development (Figure  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, this slow uptake may be due to the above-mentioned quiescence of mature pDCs; moreover, in parabiosis experiments parabiotic partner-derived splenic pDCs disappeared very rapidly after surgical separation  (29) . Thus, the true life span of peripheral pDCs remains to be established through a combination of approaches. In general, the regulation of pDC survival and quiescence is poorly understood and would provide an interesting topic of future studies.\n\nMolecular Basis of pDC Lineage Commitment\nThe upregulation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (E protein) E2-2 serves as a key lineage commitment event in pDC development, as E2-2-deficient hematopoietic progenitors fail to produce pDCs  (32) . The exact cellular stage of E2-2 induction is unknown and awaits the analysis of single-cell reporter strains for E2-2 expression. More importantly, the signals for E2-2 induction in pDCs remain obscure and may represent soluble factors, cell-associated ligands, and/or upstream transcription factors.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNotably, pDCs are more dependent on Flt3 signaling than most cDCs, as the pDC population is selectively diminished in the lymphoid organs of mice with targeted Flt3 deletion  (53)  or with mutated nonfunctional Flt3  (54) . This suggests that Flt3 signaling has a specific roleinp DCs after the common progenitor stage, possibly promoting terminal pDC differentiation or mature pDC survival. One important unresolved question has been the molecular pathway transducing Flt3L signals in pDC development. Our recent studies indicate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) mediates Flt3L signaling in DCs. In particular, pDC development in Flt3L-supplemented bone marrow cultures was exquisitely sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, even when it was added at low concentrations or at late time points that largely spared cDC development. Conversely, PI3K hyperactivation by deletion of Pten in the bone marrow greatly accelerated Flt3L-driven cDC and pDC development in culture  (55) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[citation 23]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: A census of human transcription factors: Function, expression and evolution \nAbstract: Transcription factors are key cellular components that control gene expression: their activities determine how cells function and respond to the environment. Currently, there is great interest in research into human transcriptional regulation. However, surprisingly little is known about these regulators themselves. For example, how many transcription factors does the human genome contain? How are they expressed in different tissues? Are they evolutionarily conserved? Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation. Much remains to be explored, but this study provides a solid foundation for future investigations to elucidate regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse mammalian biological processes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis resulted in a highconfidence data set of 1,391 genomic loci (~6% of the total number of protein coding genes) that encode TFs, which we will focus on for the remainder of this Analysis article, and a further 216 loci representing possible TFs (see Supplementary information S3 (.txt file) for the data set). estimates of the coverage of our approach range from 85% to 94% (Supplementary information S1 (PDF)) suggesting an upper bound of ~1,700-1,900 TFcoding genes in the human genome. Despite the care that we have taken in compiling this data set, there are a few possible sources of inaccura cies. Our method depends heavily on the content of the InterPro database, and the ability of the search algo rithms to detect these domains in protein sequences. The repertoire should be updated when new InterPro entries for newly discovered DNAbinding domains, or refinements of existing ones, and more sensitive search methods become available.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSeveral com putational studies have examined individual mamma lian TF families in detail, but only a few have attempted to identify the full complement of human TFs  29, 30  . Some previous studies of TF repertoires -particu larly those in large genomes -may contain misleading predictions for several reasons. Most of these studies depended on identifying genes that are homologous to previously characterized regulators; however, there are technical limitations to sequence search methods, and algorithms can sometimes output false positive hits. Moreover, even among true positives, some DNA binding domains also exist in nonTF proteins, making these domains unreliable markers of sequencespecific DNAbinding functionality. As a result of these difficul ties, we still lack a comprehensive characterization of the human TF repertoire. Here, we overcome some of these difficulties by focusing on a precise definition of sequencespecific DNAbinding regulators, which are among the best defined protein domains. We also minimize prediction errors by manually examining each locus that encodes a potential DNAbinding function. In doing so, we present a comprehensive and highquality census of TFs in the human genome.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOf course, the observations discussed here constitute only a first attempt to describe these regulators, and there are important caveats that should be considered when using the data. The SymAtlas data set is restricted by the fact that not all TFs are represented on the arrays used in this study; this means that we were unable to assess the expression of more than 500 TFs. Nonetheless, as the existing data covers twothirds of TFs, we expect our findings to be robust. The repertoire itself also has weak nesses: at present, we include all genes encoding C 2 H 2 zincfingers, as they are a major group of regulators; however, a major future challenge will be to distinguish between proteins that bind DNA from those that prima rily complex with RNA. We will overcome many of these limitations as new data types become available. Indeed, transcriptomic data derived from highthroughput sequencing methods, such as RNASeq, will yield pre cise expression levels for every TF, as the method does not depend on array design. The quality of the repertoire itself will also continue to improve, as better annotations of the human genome are released and a greater range of descriptions of TF functions are published.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many of the structural matrix materials that are currently utilized at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, such as solution deposited, high-k dielectrics and commercial photoresists, exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the 8\u201312 \u03bcm spectral range which represents a significant challenge to developing transmissive, three-dimensional (3D) metamaterials operating in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectral region. In this paper, we present new, low loss photopatternable polymer dielectrics as well-suited matrix materials for fabricating LWIR-metamaterials. These materials are synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees followed by a thiol-ene coupling reaction to cross-link the remaining olefin groups. After cross-linking, the olefin LWIR-absorption band is minimized and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the material increases. Thick layers of the polymer (>3 \u03bcm), which acts as a negative photoresist, can be deposited easily using a spin coating technique to develop planarizing layers with photopatternable vias. A demonstration on the low loss nature of the polymer dielectrics was carried out by incorporating the polymer into an all-dielectric, infrared metamaterial. Thus, the material is ideal for both lithography and fabrication of 3D metamaterial structures operating in the LWIR spectral region. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nLow loss photopatternable polymer dielectics appear to be a promising solution. However, off-the-shelf commerically available photoresist polymers also exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the optical regime.  27  An ideal polymer dielectric would have losses comparable to polyethylene but have the additional benefits of a resist in that it is compatible with 3D fabrication techniques, photopatternable, and high temperature process tolerant.  28  We have identified a route to a tunable matrix material which satisfies each of these requirements in the thermal infrared spectral region (8-12 mm).  29, 30  The materials are synthesized using the ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene followed by a partial hydrogenation to remove most of the IR absorbing olefin groups in the 8-12 mm range (Scheme 1). Photopatterning of these materials can then be achieved using the remaining olefin groups via a thiol-ene coupling reaction. After cross-linking, the olefin IR-absorption band is minimized and the T g of the matrix material increases.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nused in microfabrication such as polyimide and benzocyclobutene based polymer (BCB).  27  \n\nPhotopatterning\nThe optimal polymer material was tested next for microfabrication compatibility. Preliminary experiments determined that an adhesion layer was required to ensure that thick films (>1 mm) remained adhered to the silicon substrate during UV exposure. The adhesion layer was deposited by spin casting a layer of non-hydrogenated polynorbornene containing dithiol and photocross-linking via thiol-ene reaction to generate a thin film (28 nm). Next, a solution of partially hydrogenated polynorbornene (18.2%), cross-linker, and photoinitiator was prepared under the same conditions used to make the freestanding films and spun cast onto the wafer (see experimental). The film was irradiated (405 nm, 20 mW cm \u00c02 ) using a mask aligner at a total power of 6,000 mJ cm \u00c02 . The film was then developed in toluene for 5 min to remove the non cross-linked polymer and maintain the exposed regions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe polymer, shown in black in the SEM has a flat surface and planarizes well over etched tellurium cubes. Though the electric resonance (E1) and magnetic resonance (H1) shifts to a slightly higher wavelength when the polymer is present (red line), there is minimal attenuation of the resonant fields overall. reaction to cross-link the remaining olefin groups. The material characteristics were measured using FTIR and DMA analysis from free-standing films, and the optical constants of spun-cast films were characterized using IR-VASE. A 1.6 mm thick layer of photopatterned material was demonstrated using the optimum partially hydrogenated polymer (18.2%). An overcoat layer of the low loss polymer on an all-dielectric, infrared metamaterial had excellent planarization and little impact on the overall loss of the metamaterial. The thermal and spectral properties of these matrix materials suggests they are ideal components for fabricating LWIR-metamaterials and other applications that require a low loss negative photoresist.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[citation 17].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Controlling fast transport of cold trapped ions \nAbstract: We realize fast transport of ions in a segmented microstructured Paul trap. The ion is shuttled over a distance of more than 10(4) times its ground state wave function size during only five motional cycles of the trap (280 \u03bcm in 3.6 \u03bcs). Starting from a ground-state-cooled ion, we find an optimized transport such that the energy increase is as low as 0.10\u00b10.01 motional quanta. In addition, we demonstrate that quantum information stored in a spin-motion entangled state is preserved throughout the transport. Shuttling operations are concatenated, as a proof-of-principle for the shuttling-based architecture to scalable ion trap quantum computing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTransport of neutral atoms have also been performed using magnetic  [10]  or optical  [11]  techniques. Because quantum gate operations require ions close to the motional ground state and fast transport inherently creates motional excitation, the challenge is to develop transport protocols that guarantee sufficiency small energy transfer. In this work we demonstrate shuttling operations that are highly non-adiabatic while the final state of the ion is close to the motional groundstate. We also show that quantum information stored in both the motional and the spin degree of freedom is preserved through the shuttling. During a shuttling operation, the ion motion in the harmonic trapping potential is excited when the acceleration is sufficiently strong. This motional excitation is a harmonic oscillation, characterized by a well defined phase, thus allowing it to be canceled out by proper management of the forces involved during or after the transport. We experimentally demonstrate two methods of canceling the acquired motional excitation. One method uses two shuttles, where the transport to the destination generates the same net momentum transfer as the transport back, but is applied 180 \u2022 out of phase with respect to the secular oscillation of the ion (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAfter this procedure, the probing is repeated and we find that the trap frequency deviations are reduced by two orders of magnitude, down to the measurement precision of 390 Hz, using a dwell time of 100 \u00b5s. This corresponds to less than one per mille of the trap frequency, as shown in Fig.  4c . It is interesting to consider that the quantum information stored in a coherent superposition of two Fock states, even though being displaced by more than 100 phonons during the transport, can be fully retrieved. We have demonstrated fast shuttling operations with small residual motional excitation, such that the ion ends the transport near the motional groundstate. We also showed that qubit information is preserved through the shuttling by transporting a spin-motion entangled state with negligible loss of coherence. As a next step we intend to perform fast splitting operations of multi-ion crystals. Our long-term goal is to extend the transport scheme to parallel operations on multiple segments and combine it with laser-driven quantum logic gates.

For the second scheme, the self-neutral transport we apply a sharp counter-\"kick\" to the ion at the end of a single transport operation, stopping its motion (Fig.  1c ). This case of single-sided transport allows even faster shuttling and can be sequentially repeated since it is energy selfneutral, making it the preferred building block for scalable quantum information protocols. The experiments are carried out in a micro-structured segmented Paul trap  [12] , where the trapping voltage applied to each electrode segment is controlled by an FPGA-based arbitrary waveform generator that allows high resolution for both timing and voltage, while having low noise ( 10nV/ \u221a Hz at the trap frequency). Further noise reduction at high frequencies is done with a \u03a0-type filter having a cut-off frequency of 300 kHz. The axial trap frequency is \u03bd ax = \u03c9 ax /2\u03c0 = 1.41 MHz, while the radial trap frequencies are \u223c 3 MHz. The transport is carried out by varying the voltages on the segments, such that the minimum of the trapping potential is moved towards the final location in time steps of 400 ns.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Therefore, specific crystallographic symmetries or lattice parameters can only be achieved using specific nanoparticles as building blocks (and vice versa). We present six design rules that can be used to deliberately prepare nine distinct colloidal crystal structures, with control over lattice parameters on the 25- to 150-nanometer length scale. These design rules outline a strategy to independently adjust each of the relevant crystallographic parameters, including particle size (5 to 60 nanometers), periodicity, and interparticle distance. As such, this work represents an advance in synthesizing tailorable macroscale architectures comprising nanoscale materials in a predictable fashion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt is therefore the key hypothesis of our efforts in SNA-NP assembly that, because the driving force for crystallization is the formation of duplex DNA linkages: The most stable structure will maximize the number of duplex DNA connections between particles. The simplicity of this hypothesis allows us to understand the behavior of the SNA-NPs in the context of assembly so well that we have been able to develop a set of design rules for the process of crystal formation  [17] . Like Pauling's rules for atoms, these rules explain the relative stability of different lattices as a function of their DNA and nanoparticle building blocks. However, unlike Pauling's rules, this rule set allows one to predict the stability of crystal structures before they are ever synthesized. Therefore, one can direct the formation of a desired crystal structure by controlling different aspects of the building blocks, such as nanoparticle size, nanoparticle shape, DNA length, or DNA sequence  [17] . The first rule in DNA-mediated assembly is: SNA-NPs of equal hydrodynamic radii will form an fcc lattice when using self-complementary DNA sequences, and a bcc lattice when using two SNA-NPs with complementary DNA sequences (Fig.  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, a comparison of the modeled phase diagram and the experimental data demonstrated greater than 90 % agreement between the two; i. e. over 90% of the crystal structures obtained experimentally were correctly predicted by the phase diagram as being the most stable arrangement of particles. Because each of the SNA-NPs used to assemble these superlattices is functionalized with a large number of DNA strands, it is possible to put multiple DNA sequences on a single nanoparticle. Therefore, the fifth rule of DNA-programmed assembly is: SNA-NPs can be functionalized with more than one oligonucleotide bonding element, providing access to crystal structures not possible with single element SNA-NPs. For example, a SNA-NP that is functionalized with linkers containing self-complementary sticky ends would be predicted to form an fcc lattice as its thermodynamic product, as per rule 1. However, if this SNA-NP were also functionalized with a second type of DNA linker that contained a sticky end complementary to the sticky ends of a different SNA-NP, additional DNA linkages could be created.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn other words, two nanoparticles can be made to behave as if they were exactly the same size, even if they possess inorganic nanoparticle cores of widely different diameters; this is achieved by altering the DNA linker lengths on the two particles so that the sums of the DNA length and nanoparticle core are equivalent (Fig.  4 ). This enables the synthesis of CsCl-type lattices, which exhibit the same connectivity as bcc lattices, but utilize particles of with different inorganic cores. Interestingly, appropriate choice of DNA linker lengths allows for two particles to have the same hydrodynamic radius (and therefore same assembly behavior) even if one particle has an inorganic core that is three times the size of the other. The third rule for DNA-programmed assembly is: In a binary system based upon complementary SNA-NPs, favored products will tend to have equivalent numbers of each complementary DNA sequence, evenly spaced throughout a unit cell. In order to achieve more complex crystallographic symmetries, DNA and nanoparticle combinations must be used where, unlike the fcc, bcc, and CsCl lattices mentioned previously, nanoparticle assembly behavior is not equivalent for the two particles in a binary system.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Defocus parameters are estimated by fitting a model of the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF) to an image's amplitude spectrum. Here we describe modifications to the algorithm which make it significantly faster and more suitable for use with images collected using modern technologies such as dose fractionation and phase plates. We show that this new version preserves the accuracy of the original algorithm while allowing for higher throughput. We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nEstimating the electron microscope's objective lens defocus and astigmatism from micrographs is of great importance in the three-dimensional reconstruction of biological specimens (reviewed by  Cheng et al., 2015) . Many programs are available for this purpose. Of those, CTFFIND3  (Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003)  is widely used and thought to perform well under a range of circumstances  (Marabini et al., 2015) . We present an updated version of this program, called CTFFIND4, which aims to match the quality of results obtained with CTFFIND3 and to do so significantly faster.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdapted from Figure  3  of  Mindell and Grigorieff (2003) .

Figure  3 : Image E generated from the CTF fit to micrograph #1 of set #7 of the CTF challenge. At every pixel (corresponding to a spatial frequency vector g), this image records n, the number of preceding CTF extrema (Equation  11 ). Here this value is color-coded, so that pixels at spatial frequencies before the first extremum of the CTF, which have value 0, are displayed in dark blue. Pixels that have 35 or more preceding CTF extrema are shown in dark red. .

Among the four vulture species breeding in the western Palaearctic, the species showing the steepest population decline, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, is a long-distance migrant wintering in Africa. However, the flyways and wintering areas of the species are only known for some populations, and without knowledge of where mortality occurs, effective conservation management is not possible. We tracked 19 juvenile Egyptian Vultures from the declining breeding population on the Balkan Peninsula between 2010 and 2014 to estimate survival and identify important migratory routes and wintering areas for this species. Mortality during the first autumn migration was high (monthly survival probability 0.75) but mortality during migration was exclusively associated with suboptimal navigation. All birds from western breeding areas and three birds from central and eastern breeding areas attempted to fly south over the Mediterranean Sea, but only one in 10 birds survived this route, probably due to stronger tailwind. All eight birds using the migratory route via Turkey and the Middle East successfully completed their first autumn migration. Of 14 individual and environmental variables examined to explain why juvenile birds did or did not successfully complete their first migration, the natal origin of the bird was the most influential. We speculate that in a declining population with fewer experienced adults, an increasing proportion of juvenile birds are forced to migrate without conspecific guidance, leading to high mortality as a consequence of following sub-optimal migratory routes. Juvenile Egyptian Vultures wintered across a vast range of the Sahel and eastern Africa, and had large movement ranges with core use areas at intermediate elevations in savannah, cropland or desert. Two birds were shot in Africa, where several significant threats exist for vultures at continental scales. Given the broad distribution of the birds and threats, effective conservation in Africa will be challenging and will require long-term investment. We recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2004) . Such a strategy is riskier for birds from western breeding areas, where the shortest route will lead the birds either via the Peloponnese or via islands in the Aegean Sea across a > 250-km stretch of open water to the coast of northern Africa, an exceptional strategy for a large raptor that may only be viable in very favourable wind conditions  (Bildstein 2006 , Agostini et al. 2015) . In contrast, birds from more eastern breeding populations reach Turkey via the Bosphorus or the Dardanelles when heading in a southerly direction. To avoid the hazardous route over the Mediterranean, the Table  4 . Mean proportion of habitat types and environmental variables at winter locations within the core 50% utilization distribution, compared with locations within winter movement ranges of wintering juvenile Egyptian Vultures in Africa. Wintering home-ranges were based on 50% kernel utilization distributions, and movement ranges were based on 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP). Relative variable importance was calculated using a permutation procedure based on a random forest model classifying locations as core range locations. GPP: general primary productivity.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDuring this time, winter movement ranges were large and included multiple centres of activity, in which birds remained for several weeks before exploring alternative areas. The average core 50% utilization distribution was 28 000 km 2 , but ranged from < 5000 to  > 90 000 km 2 among individuals (Table  3 ). Winter movement ranges (100% minimum convex polygon) were more than an order of magnitude larger (> 310 000 km 2 ), with similarly large varia-tion among individuals (Table  3 ). Wintering regions ranged from southwest Yemen to Nigeria, with core wintering areas in southern Chad and Sudan (Fig.  3 ). Head length (cm) Log(probability of successful migration)/2 The habitat in core ranges in which juvenile vultures spent 50% of their time differed from the habitat encountered in winter movement ranges. Our random forest model explained 81.9% of the variation in the data and successfully classified locations as core wintering locations. Elevation and landscape type were the most important variables distinguishing core locations from those available in movement ranges (Table  4 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nyears, however, there has been increasing awareness that events during migration or on wintering grounds can affect populations of migratory animals \n(Newton 2004 , Studds & Marra 2005 , Both et al. 2006) . Identifying migration routes, stopover areas and wintering areas for migratory species that are declining is therefore necessary for designing effective conservation strategies that can address threats operating outside breeding areas  (Wilcove & Wikelski 2008) . The decline of long-distance migrants has been most apparent for passerines and smaller-bodied birds but there is evidence that long-distance migratory raptors are also declining  (Hoffman & Smith 2003) . Among the four vulture species that breed in the western Palaearctic, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is the only longdistance migrant that travels to wintering regions in sub-Saharan Africa  (Porter & Beaman 1985 , Meyburg et al. 2004 , Garc \u0131a-Ripoll es et al. 2010) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Quantitative (q)PCR is the current gold standard for DNA measurement and genetic diagnostics but remains poorly suited to measurements of absolute concentration, has a limited precision (~20%), and presents difficulties in reliably detecting low-copy-number templates due to nonspecific amplification and competitive side reactions. qPCR measurements are thus inadequate for demanding applications such as early detection of cancer and monitoring of residual disease  [1] , analysis of single-cell gene expression  [2] , and the diagnosis of fetal genetic disorders using small allelic imbalances in circulating DNA.\n\nTHEORY\nA promising solution to such measurement problems is digital PCR  [3] , a single-molecule counting technique. Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample at limiting dilution followed by PCR amplification and endpoint detection to identify the presence or absence of template molecules in each reaction. All performance metrics of digital PCR, including sensitivity, precision and dynamic range, improve with the total number of digital reactions performed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nReliable discrimination of 2% and 3% enrichment was obtained reproducibly using sub-arrays of 100,000 chambers, while 1% enrichment was only well-resolved using full 1,000,000 chamber arrays.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn addition to enabling new measurements in biomedical research and diagnostics, the high assay density in our device has important implications for the adoption of digital PCR as a routine analytical tool. Thus, we contend that megapixel digital PCR or similar high-density formats will ultimately replace real-time qPCR as the standard analytical tool for absolute DNA measurement.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAfter PCR thermocycling, the devices were scanned at 0.5 micron per pixel (Figure  1d ) and analyzed using a custom image analysis software written in C for automated segmentation of chambers (Figure  1e ). \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nHere we present a valve-free microfluidic digital PCR device that performs a million single molecule PCR reactions in uniform arrays of pl volume chambers having densities up to 440,000 reactions cm -2 (Figure  1a ).

In particular, the remarkable device efficiency is strongly influenced by the perovskite crystallinity and the film morphology. Here, we investigate the perovskites crystallisation kinetics and growth mechanism in real time from liquid precursor continually to the final uniform film. We utilize some advanced in situ characterisation techniques including synchrotron-based grazing incident X-ray diffraction to observe crystal structure and chemical transition of perovskites. The nano-assemble model from perovskite intermediated [PbI6]4- cage nanoparticles to bulk polycrystals is proposed to understand perovskites formation at a molecular- or nano-level. A crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic crystallisation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these in situ dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation and transformation from the molecular to the microstructure over relevant temperature and time scales is successfully demonstrated. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1 . For the traditional spincoating technique  21  , most of the deposition solution is ejected during rotation and the subsequent thermal annealing process begins with the intermediated complex film, hindering the capture of the whole crystallisation process. The in situ printing experiment was conducted in the helium atmosphere to reduce the air scattering. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 M lead acetate (Pb(Ac) 2 ) and 1.2 M methylammonium iodide (MAI) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). A PEDOT:PSS-coated silicon wafer was used as the sample substrate. Different substrate temperatures were adjusted to control the kinetics of crystallisation. A series of 2D GIXD images at different stages of drying are shown in Fig.  1  and Supplementary Fig.  2 . In a starting solution, the mixed precursors are essentially point scatters dissolved in DMF, where the liquid scattering from DMF dominates, with a diffuse reflection at qB1.5 \u00c5 \u00c0 1 being evident.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe 60 \u00b0C-processed thin film with smaller size droplets were still not continuous. At 80 \u00b0C, the film showed slightly enlarged droplets, many of which merged together to form larger domains. When the heating temperature was increased to 100 \u00b0C, a highly regular, banded topography with a period of B2 mm was seen (Supplementary Figs  10  and 11 ). The height variation of this periodic structure at the surface, that is, the amplitude, was B200 nm (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). At the centre of these banded structures, a plateau consisting of nanoscopic crystallites was also observed. These structures are very much akin to spherlitic textures seen in semi-crystalline polymers and metals  [35] [36] [37]  , where a radial growth of crystals emanates from a nucleus, and as the crystals grow outward, the growth fronts impinge on each other, arresting the crystallisation, forming the polygonal textures. The sizes and shapes of the polygonal structures are dictated by the areal density of nucleation  35  . The higher the nucleation density, the smaller the textures.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nT molecular-or nano-scale. The temperature-dependent crystallisation process also makes effects on the final film morphology. The time evolution of the film morphology under in situ heating is obtained by the compound optical microscope. The formation of periodic patterns during the growth process is observed which could be attributed to a competition between the linear growth of the crystals and a depletion of crystallisable material. The crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic nucleation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation from molecular to microstructure is successfully demonstrated.\n\n\nResults\nPerovskites crystallisation and structure transformation. All GIXD measurements were performed on beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Sources of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with critical methods to obtain the perovskites structure formation and crystal growth in real time.

Imaging of fluorescent proteins (FPs) using red excitation light in the 'optical window' above 600 nm is one potential method for visualizing implanted cells. However, previous efforts to engineer FPs with peak excitation beyond 600 nm have resulted in undesirable reductions in brightness. Here we report three new red-excitable monomeric FPs obtained by structure-guided mutagenesis of mNeptune. Two of these, mNeptune2 and mNeptune2.5, demonstrate improved maturation and brighter fluorescence than mNeptune, whereas the third, mCardinal, has a red-shifted excitation spectrum without reduction in brightness. We show that mCardinal can be used to non-invasively and longitudinally visualize the differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes in living mice with high anatomical detail. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nLentiviral constructs expressed in MuSCs were hLIG-EF1\u03b1-mCardinal-IRES PV -luciferase2 and pLL3.7-EF1\u03b1-mCardinal-IRES EMCV -Clover-P2A-luciferase2.

Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Ni\u00f1o years record larger than average atmospheric CO2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric CO2 and climate change. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n), they would show a significant reduction of carbon uptake, primarily driven by the ocean stratification, and reduced ocean thermohaline circulation  [28] [29] [30] . Terrestrial models also investigated the effect of CO 2 and climate, always agreeing on the positive response of land carbon storage to atmospheric CO 2 increase (the so-called fertilization effect), but not reaching consensus on the terrestrial ecosystem response to the associated climate change. Some earlier studies found an enhanced terrestrial productivity  [31]  while later studies found the opposite  [32, 33] . The third assessment report of IPCC concluded that, by mid-twenty-first century, climate change would reduce the land carbon uptake by 21% to 43% and the ocean carbon uptake by 6% to 25%, relative to CO 2 only driven uptakes  [34] . This IPCC range was very conservative, as further discussed below. Nevertheless, all these studies gave a clear signal to the climate modelling community: one cannot simulate future climate change assuming atmospheric CO 2 can be known, a priori, from the CO 2 emissions trajectory.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe same applies for the observation-based estimates; the last millennium climate probably explores a too narrow range of climate variations to trigger large release of carbon from permafrost, and, as mentioned above, the emerging constraint is limited to tropical ecosystems. Although not included in ESMs yet, permafrost ecosystems are now being represented in land surface models, and estimate of the potential release of carbon from these systems have been made recently  [57] [58] [59] [60] . Estimates vary widely due to uncertainty in the processes at play (rate of soil thawing, fine-scale processes, fraction of carbon released, potential mitigating role of nutrient, etc.). The IPCC AR5 concluded, 'There is high confidence that reductions in permafrost extent due to warming will cause thawing of some currently frozen carbon. However, there is low confidence on the magnitude of carbon losses through CO 2 and CH 4 emissions to the atmosphere, with a range from 50 to 250 GtC between 2000 and 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario'  [4] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAlmost 10 years later, within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), a similar analysis was performed with CMIP5 ESMs, giving essentially the same conclusion, the land carbon cycle response to atmospheric CO 2 and climate change is still poorly constrained  [40] . New ESMs now include a representation of the nitrogen cycle. This has two opposite effects on land carbon storage. First, accounting for nitrogen leads to a lower response to atmospheric CO 2 ; as nitrogen limitations reduce the photosynthesis enhancement under increasing atmospheric CO 2 . Second, nitrogen also reduces the carbon loss due to climate change; as soil warming leads to increased nitrogen mineralization, hence increasing nitrogen availability to the plant  [41, 42] . The Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group I of the IPCC AR5 headlined that 'Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO 2 in the atmosphere (high confidence)'.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show that the singularity corrections for treating these divergencies depend only on the total number and the positions of k points and on the lattice vectors, in particular, the unit cell volume, but not on the particular positions of atoms within the unit cell. The method proposed here to treat the singularities constitutes a stable, simple to implement, and general scheme that can be applied to systems with arbitrary lattice parameters within either the EXX Kohn-Sham or the HF formalism. We apply the singularity correction to a typical symmetric structure, diamond, and to a more general structure, trans-polyacetylene. We consider the effect of the singularity corrections on volume optimizations and k-point convergence. While the singularity correction clearly depends on the total number of k points, it exhibits a remarkably small dependence upon the choice of the specific arrangement of the k points. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n\u00b5k (0) Y wq,\u03bdk (0) |k -q| 2 -\u03b7 wk Y * wk,\u00b5k (0) Y wk,\u03bdk (0) f (k -q) - w \u03b7 wk Y * wk,\u00b5k (0) Y wk,\u03bdk (0) 4\u03c0 \u2126 \u2126 (2\u03c0) 3 BZ dq f (q) = - 4\u03c0 \u2126 w q =k \u03b7 wq Y * wq,\u00b5k (0) Y wq,\u03bdk (0) |k -q| 2 + w \u03b7 wk Y * wk,\u00b5k ( The required sums Fk and the integral F have to be calculated only once at the beginning of the self-consistency procedure and then multiplied by w \u03b7 wk Y * wk,\u00b5k (0) Y wk,\u03bdk (0) in each HF self-consistency cycle, because the Y * wk,\u00b5k (0) Y wk,\u03bdk (0) and the occupation numbers \u03b7 wk change during the self-consistency cycle.

RESULTS FOR DIAMOND AND TRANS -POLYACETYLENE\nThe applicability of the presented approach for treating the divergencies is now demonstrated by applying it to two cases, diamond and trans-polyacetylene, using different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals: the Slater-Dirac (exchange-only LDA) referred to as Dirac exchange in the following, the complete exchange-correlation LDA in the parametrisation of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN), 8 the combination of Dirac exchange plus Perdew86 9 (P86) correlation (P86 being VWN correlation plus a gradient correction), the EXX (exact-exchange only), and finally the combination of EXX with P86 correlation. The pseudopotentials were generated using the pseudopotential generation code of Engel,  26  which is based on the Troullier-Martins norm-conserving scheme.  27  In all cases the pseudopotentials were generated using consistently the same functionals for exchange and correlation as for the plane wave calculations. Relativistic effect are not included.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(15) This implies that for the evaluation of the exchange energy the singular terms in the original expression (6) can first simply be omitted and then be taken into account by N v [ F -F ], i.e., by adding N v [ F -F ] to the exchange energy obtained if the singular terms are simply omitted. The correction is calculated only once before the self-consistency procedure. In fact, the correction N v [ F -F ] depends only on the unit cell lattice vectors, and thus in particular on the unit cell volume V , and on the number N k and the positions of the k points. It does not depend on the number, type, or positions of the atoms within the unit cell, and does not depend on the one-particle wave functions. This has obvious advantages for atomic relaxations at fixed unit cell volumes and fixed lattices. The whole scheme, of course, hinges on the availability of a suitable function f (q). For fcc systems such a function was given by Gygi and Baldereschi.  20  For sc, bcc, hexagonal, and orthorhombic systems Wenzien 21 presented such functions.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The resulting fusion gene products have attracted considerable interest as diagnostic and promising therapeutic targets. So far, oncogenic FET fusion proteins have been regarded as strong transcription factors that aberrantly activate or repress target genes of their DNA-binding fusion partners. However, the role of the transactivating domain in the context of the normal FET proteins is poorly defined, and, therefore, our knowledge on how FET aberrations impact on tumor biology is incomplete. Since we believe that a full understanding of aberrant FET protein function can only arise from looking at both sides of the coin, the good and the evil, this paper summarizes evidence for the central function of FET proteins in bridging RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFUS has been demonstrated to bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs  [15] . EWS might have similar sequence specificity since it was demonstrated to bind strongly to both poly G and poly U, but not to poly A and poly C RNA, homopolymers  [16] . Although it is only the zinc finger domain of FUS that makes physical contact with the GGUG motif, all three RGG boxes together with the RRM contribute to this activity  [15] . Intriguingly, a recent study identified strong binding of FUS to human telomeric RNA  [17]  and to small low-copy-number RNAs tethered to the promoter of cyclin D1  [18] . Nothing is known about the RNA binding specificity TAF15.\n\nA Role for FET\nProteins in RNA Transcription. The FET N-terminal domain (NTD) resembles the activation domain of certain transcription factors such as SP-1 rich in glutamine and proline residues.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntriguingly, the RNA binding activity of FUS was reported to act as a sensor for DNA damage and to elicit transcriptional repression; as exemplified for cyclin D (CCND1) promoter regulation, DNA damage was demonstrated to induce the expression of single-stranded, low-copy-number ncRNA transcripts tethered to the 5 regulatory regions of CCND1 which recruit FUS and allosterically modify it to bind to and repress CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities  [18] . Activation of gene transcription by many, if not all, sequence-specific transcription factors requires DNAtopoisomerase-II-beta-dependent, transient, site-specific dsDNA break formation  [78] . One may speculate that the proposed role of FET proteins in recombination repair is linked to their association with transcription initiation complexes at promoter regions.

As demonstrated for EWS, the association with most interacting proteins depends on the presence of RNA and is destroyed upon RNaseA treatment (Table  1 ). The functional roles of interacting proteins suggest a general bridging role for FET proteins coupling RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. 2.2. RNA Binding of FET Proteins. Several functional FET domains were defined (see Figure  1 ): the N-terminal domain is largely composed of a highly repetitive primary sequence containing multiple copies of a degenerate hexapeptide repeat motif similar to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.

Furthermore, the average phonon mean free path is large by comparison with the phonon wavelength, about 10\u22124 cm at 2 \u00b0K and decreasing as T\u22124 at larger T, suggesting a Rayleigh-type scattering mechanism. Such a mean free path can be quantitatively explained by approximating the glassy structure with that of a crystal in which every atom is displaced from its lattice site. Then every atom scatters like an interstitial atom, or\u2014even simpler\u2014like one that is missing at its regular lattice site, with a scattering cross section determined by the missing mass (isotopic defect). The specific heat of amorphous SiO2, GeO2, and Se has been found to vary as AT+BT3 between 0.1 and 1 \u00b0K, with A = 10 erg/g\u00b0K2 within a factor of 2. This departure from the Debye specific heat may be characteristic of the glassy state, as all earlier measurements of other glasses [polystyrene, glycerol, Lucite (PMMA)] indicate a similar anomaly. Its origin is not clear. Impurities or surface effects through adsorbed gases are unlikely because of the many samples and experimental techniques used in different laboratories. We have tried to attribute the anomaly to low-lying electronic states, motional states of ions, trapped atoms or large groups of atoms, or one-dimensional vibrations within a three-dimensional solid, so far without success. At the present time, the only independent evidence for these excitations appears to be in the low-temperature thermal conductivity at T < 1 \u00b0K described above. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe thermal conductivity of noncrystalline dielectric solids differs markedly from that of crystalline ones. ' As an example, Fig.  1  shows the conductivities of crystalline and vitreous silicon dioxide. In crystals, the conductivity increases with decreasing temperature because the anhar- monic umklapp processes become less frequent, and hence the phonon mean free path increases. Eventually, the mean free path becomes comparable to the sample dimensions, and the conductivity goes through a maximum and then decreases as the specific heat decreases. The conductivity of crystals depends very much on the material, and in ad- dition any disturbance of the lattice periodicity lowers the conductivity in a sometimes very characteristic way, as shown in Fig.  1 , for example. In noncrystalline solids, the conductivity is several orders of magnitude smaller than in crystals, it decreases monotonically with decreasing tempera- ture, and furthermore it is independent of the chem- ical composition: In Fig.  2 , the conductivity of vitreous silica~' 7 is compared with that of silica- based glasses containing large amounts of other oxides.  '  The conductivities are practically surfaces.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe simplest way to analyze thermal conductivity data is in the dominant-phonon approximation. In this approximation, one assumes that the heat is carried exclusively by those phonons which con- tribute most to the specific heat at that temperature, i. e. , those phonons for which dC\"/der is a maximum. In the Debye approximation, the angular frequency of the dominant phonons is 5. 65x10\" radsec ' (3 cm ' in the wave-number measure) at 1 'K and is proportional to the temperature. Thus, if C\"and v are known, l (va, ) can be determined from the ex- periment with the help of Eq. (1). A simple esti- mate of the error to be expected if this method is used to determine the frequency dependence of the phonon mean free path was made as follows: The phonon scattering rates 7 \"',(&o) resulting from iso- topic mixtures in crystals are known both from theory and experiment.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo summarize, we have obtained the following remarkable result: In the temperature range above decreases as the fourth power of the temperature, and its magnitude is close to that predicted by the \"isotopic\" model. Above 20 K the mean free path approaches the intermolecular separation. The characteristic plateau of the conductivity of non- crystalline solids also finds a very simple explanation: The phonon mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, and finally reaches a con- stant value. The specific heat, on the other hand, increases with increasing temperature, and finally reaches a constant value. The plateau occurs in the temperature region in which the product of mean free path and specific heat happens to be temperature independent. According to this picture, the plateau has nothing to do with a resonance dip, and its origin is actually similar to that of the maximum in the conductivity curve of a crystal. Below 5 'K, the mean free path changes less rapidly than as T 4. Below 1 'K in vitreous silica and Pyrex it varies as T ' . The same tempera- ture dependence is found in vitreous Se below 0.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n98. If one considers the large average binding energy of 82.0 kcal/mol, the DFT-D3 results can be regarded as mostly very accurate and an MAD value of about 2 kcal/mol for PW6B95 is close to the accuracy of the reference values \u0351and to remaining basis set incompleteness effects\u0352. For all 11 DFs the average MAD decreases from 7.8 \u0351DFT\u0352 to 5.2 \u0351DFT-D2\u0352 and 4.3 kcal/mol for DFT-D3. Only for PBE and PBE0 which have a clear overbinding tendency already without any correction, \u0351both\u0352 versions worsen the results. Note, however, that these two DFs without correction do not give the right answer for the right reason: they simulate the effects of dispersion \u0351that become more important as the size of the system increases\u0352 by overbinding of each hydrogen bond.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe by far largest enhancements are found for the peptide and alkane conformers and the rare gas dimer binding energies. This is clearly related to the use of C 6 \u0351CN\u0352 values \u0351which is of particular importance for car-bon\u0352 and much more accurate parameters for the heavier elements in RG6 \u0351up to Z =86\u0352. As a cross validation we furthermore considered the socalled WATER27 benchmark set \u0351Fig. 8, for details, see Ref. 98\u0352. It consists of 27 neutral \u0351H 2 O\u0352 n , positively charged H + \u0351H 2 O\u0352 n and negatively charged OH -\u0351H 2 O\u0352 n clusters. It can be regarded as a tough test for the description of strong hydrogen bonds and is sensitive to the midrange \u0351due to the small intermolecular distances\u0352 as well as the asymptotic region \u0351due to the large size of the clusters up to n =20\u0352. For this set the def2-QZVP basis was augmented with diffuse sp-functions on the oxygen atoms, as recommended in Ref. 98.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt was subsequently extended to include C 8 and C 10 coefficients as well.  47  Calculations with this method and a specially chosen functional for 45 complexes resulted in remarkably accurate binding energies compared to high-level reference data.  48, 49  Sato and Nakai 6 used a similar strategy that mainly differs in the computation of dispersion coefficients of the atoms in the molecule and an asymptotic correction of the exchangecorrelation part. Their so-called LC-BOP+ LRD method provides high accuracy for the standard benchmark set of noncovalent interactions \u0351S22 50 \u0352. Tkatchenko and Scheffler 45 also computed system-dependent C 6 coefficients for atoms in molecules by a scaling of free atom values by a densityderived, Hirschfeld-partitioned effective atomic volume. These values are then used in a standard \u0351damped\u0352 DFT-Dtype treatment and good results have been reported with the PBE functional for the S22 set.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2d, e ). After stretching the device for 100 cycles between 0% and 25% strain, the mobility along the stretching direction was decreased by about 40% (that is, from 1.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 to 0.74 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) and was further reduced to 0.017 cm 2 V -1 s -1 when subjected to 100% strain. However, when the strain was along the perpendicular direction, the device showed higher durability and robustness. Even after 100 cycles up to 100% strain, only a 26% decrease in mobility was observed. Only a 19% decrease in mobility was observed for 100 cycles up to 25% strain (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). In addition to intrinsic stretchability, the healing ability enabled by the dynamic bonding represents another major advantage of the polymer design. Although the self-healing abilities of non-conjugated polymer networks cross-linked with hydrogen-bonding sites have been reported  26  , self-healing ability has not been investigated for conjugated polymers.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIncreasing the non-conjugated moiety content within the backbone also improved the solubility in polar solvents such as THF and DMF. The synthetic procedures for precursors, monomers and polymers are detailed in the Supplementary Information. Molecular weight, polydispersity index, monomers and polymer characterization are all detailed in the Supplementary Information. All results are from polymers with number average molecular weight M n over 14 kDa and with a polydispersity below 4. Polymers with low M n values showed less improvement in stretchability. Thin-film characterization. To be consistent with films used for transistor fabrication and characterization, all films tested have thicknesses in the range 30-35 nm. They were spin-coated on OTS-treated SiO 2 /Si substrate from chlorobenzene solution (5 mg ml -1 ) at 2,000 r.p.m. in glove box and thermally annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 10 min. They were subsequently transferred to PDMS elastic substrates. The thin-film annealing temperature was found to affect stretchability.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1c  and Supplementary Fig.  18f ), which again suggests the importance of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding for enhanced mechanical properties. However, as compared to polymers P2, P3 and P4 (all containing pyridine moieties), its stretchability was reduced. This suggests that the introduction of pyridine moieties may contribute to the enhanced mechanical properties either through participating in intra-and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding or through changing the morphology of the film. Finally, reference polymer P7 was synthesized to remove the hydrogen-bonding amide hydrogens (Fig.  1a ). P7 showed a decreased stretchability with an onset strain for crack formation of about 25% (Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Fig.  18g ). The above control experiments with reference polymers further confirm the important contribution of the dynamic non-covalent hydrogenbond-forming moieties as strain-releasing elements for enhancing the stretchability of conjugated polymers. To evaluate the charge transport behaviour of our fabricated stretchable semiconducting polymers, OTFTs were fabricated and characterized (Fig.  2a ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The case of Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas (EFCAs) in China is telling [citation 22].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Securing natural capital and expanding equity to rescale civilization \nAbstract: In biophysical terms, humanity has never been moving faster nor further from sustainability than it is now. Our increasing population size and per capita impacts are severely testing the ability of Earth to provide for peoples' most basic needs. Awareness of these circumstances has grown tremendously, as has the sophistication of efforts to address them. But the complexity of the challenge remains daunting. We explore prospects for transformative change in three critical areas of sustainable development: achieving a sustainable population size and securing vital natural capital, both in part through reducing inequity, and strengthening the societal leadership of academia. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTaken together, these efforts span the globe and target a full suite of ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water supply, flood control, coastal protection and enhancement of scenic beauty (and associated recreation/ tourism values)  67, 68  . The ecosystem service investments being made in China today stand out in their ambitious goals, scale and duration. Prompted by massive droughts and flooding in 1997-1998, China implemented several national forestry and conservation initiatives to address the nation's growing environmental crises, involving approximately 120 million households and investing approximately 700 billion yuan over 2000-2010  69  . China is currently also undertaking a first national assessment of ecosystem services, spanning a wide range of ecosystems, services and scales. Perhaps most ambitiously, China is establishing a new network of 'ecosystem function conservation areas' (EFCAs; Fig.  3 ). EFCAs are being zoned so as to focus conservation and restoration in places with high return on investment for public benefit; at the same time, high-impact human activities are being zoned to sustain or enhance natural capital values.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese initiatives have dual goals: to harmonize people and nature by securing critical natural capital, and to alleviate poverty. Specifically, the government aims to protect ecosystems and their biodiversity for flood control, hydropower production efficiency, irrigation supply, more productive agriculture and tourism. In addition, it aims to open non-farm sectors, increase household income and make land-use practices more sustainable in rural areas  70  . Although these initiatives represent a massive scientific and policy undertaking, there is still little understanding of the local costs of implementation, or their effects on poor and vulnerable populations in or near the target areas. The EFCA model represents a new paradigm for integrating conservation and human development, but for this policy innovation to have wide applicability, it will be important to assess and improve local livelihoods  71  .\n\nGender and gender equity in sustainability\nAs evidence for the value of community-based resource management has accumulated  72  , a special role for women in environmental sustainability has begun to emerge. Cross-national studies reveal a strong association between high levels of deforestation and impaired \n\nRESEARCH REVIEW\nhealth for women, increased household labour and reduced income  73  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn theory, if institutions recognize the values of ecosystem services, then we can greatly enhance investments in the natural capital that generates them and foster human well-being at the same time. In practice, we are still in the early stages of developing the scientific basis, and the policy and finance mechanisms, for integrating natural capital into land use and other resource decisions on large scales. Relative to other forms of capital, assets embodied in ecosystems have been poorly understood and scarcely monitored, and are undergoing rapid, unchecked degradation  [56] [57] [58]  . Natural capital and the ecosystem services that flow from it are typically undervalued-by governments, businesses and the public-and recognized only upon their loss  [59] [60] [61] [62]  . The urgent challenge today is to move from theory to real-world honing and implementation of ecosystem service tools and approaches to resource decisions taken by individuals, communities, corporations, governments and other organizations  63  . A great diversity of efforts to implement the ecosystem services framework has emerged worldwide (Box 1). Collectively, they represent a promising shift towards a more inclusive, integrated and effective set of strategies  [64] [65] [66]  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Obstacles blocking wider adoption of FIB-SEM include slow imaging speed and lack of long-term system stability, which caps the maximum possible acquisition volume. Here, we present techniques that accelerate image acquisition while greatly improving FIB-SEM reliability, allowing the system to operate for months and generating continuously imaged volumes > 106 \u00b5m3. These volumes are large enough for connectomics, where the excellent z resolution can help in tracing of small neuronal processes and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming human proofreading effort. Even higher resolution can be achieved on smaller volumes. We present example data sets from mammalian neural tissue, Drosophila brain, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to illustrate the power of this novel high-resolution technique to address questions in both connectomics and cell biology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe probe current was set at ~4 nA and working distance at ~3 mm with imaging speed of 4 MHz. The x-y pixel size was 8 nm for both systems unless noted. SEM images were acquired for every 2 nm of material removal. After the final image series were registered using IMOD  (Kremer et al., 1996)  or SIFT plug-in of Fiji  (Schindelin et al., 2012) , every four consecutive images were binned down to one, forming an image stack with isotropic voxels of 8 \u00c2 8 \u00c2 8 nm 3 . The gallium FIB column was operated at 30 keV. A 7-nA probe current was selected for milling with the FEI Magnum column, while a 13-or 27-nA probe current was used in a Zeiss NVision40. A repeated line scan of 0.1 mm pixel and 1-MHz frequency was applied. A 10 Hz PID closed-loop algorithm written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controlled the line scan position relative to the specimen block-face.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe bottom of the SEM column was prone to contamination by FIB-sputtered material over time due to its close proximity, reducing image quality and affecting system stability especially after a system pause. Contamination of the SEM column from FIB-sputtered material was further accelerated with shorter working distance. Accordingly, a mechanical shutter was installed to shield the SEM column during FIB milling. The shutter kept the bottom of SEM column debris-free even after hundreds of thousands of milling cycles, and also greatly reduced focus and stigmation drift when the FIB re-engaged. This shutter arrangement would be even more valuable if a beneath-the-lens electron detector were used.\n\nSignal quantification\nA quantified SEM image signal whose grey-scale values correspond to a known number of detected electrons is an important aid to understand the properties of the SEM detector and the staining level of a sample. To achieve this quantification for any specific brightness and contrast setting of the SEM, a background image is first collected by blanking the electron beam, defining the grey value corresponding to zero electrons. The response of the SEM detector can then be calibrated using two independent methods.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWith this approach, we were able to boost the throughput by a factor of 10 or more over EsB detection alone. However, when the steady state FIB-SEM imaging generated only limited and tolerable artifacts (e.g. streak artifacts, which could be removed by a simple mask on the Fourier transform), the 0 to +400 V sample bias and the larger aperture of the InLens detector gave the best signal-to-noise and throughput performance.\n\nSignal and resolution: comparison to ion optic and Monte Carlo simulations\nTo gain more insight into mechanisms underlying the detection efficiency, its limits and imaging resolution, we modeled the physics of the electron/sample interaction and the scattered electron detection efficiency, validating the models by comparison with known 'calibration' samples. Only a small fraction of the electrons from the incoming primary electron beam will be scattered back and collected by the detector, and an even smaller variation of that signal corresponds to the contrast generated by the stained and unstained parts of the sample. Monte Carlo simulations can provide a useful perspective.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A triple point was found in each compound below 100 MPa. By pressurization, the low pressure phases disappeared at the triple point in the chloride and bromide while a new high-pressure phase appeared in the iodide. The pressures and temperatures of the triple points are 75.1 MPa, 175.7 K for CH3NH3PbCl3, 43.2 MPa, 152.9 K for CH3NH3PbBr3, and 84.8 MPa, 176.2 K for CH3NH3PbI3. All the boundaries between the cubic and tetragonal phases are upward convex and that of the iodide has a maximum at about 120 MPa. Other phase boundaries are essentially straight lines in the measured pressure and temperature ranges. By the use of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the transition volumes were calculated from the slopes of the phase boundaries and the transition entropies obtained in a previously published calorimetric experiment (J. Phys. Chem. Solids51, 1383 (1990)). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe heating rate was 0.6-0.9 K min-I. The Pna2, -I4/mcm transition of the crystal occurred at higher temperatures with increasing pressure. On further pressurization, the peak split into two at around 85 MPa. The two peaks separated further at higher pressures. This indicates that the triple point exists at about 85 MPa, above which a new phase appears. Thus, the triple points were found in all of the three MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals below 100 MPa. The experimental DTA curves of MAPbBr, and MAPbI, in the high temperature region are shown in Figs  4  and 5 , respectively. The heating rates were 0.7-1.0 and 0.7-0.8 K min-' for MAPbBr, and MAPbI,, respectively. An endothermic peak due to the I4/mcm -Pm3m transition was observed in both samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOur purpose is to determine the p-T phase diagrams of the three halides and thereby to obtain \n\nEXPERIMENTAL\nThe sample preparation of MAPbX, is the same as described in the previous paper  [5] . The DTA experiments were performed with a home-made apparatus described elsewhere  [8] . It was essentially a metal block made of copper-beryllium alloy. Two wells were drilled symmetrically in the block, one being for the sample and the other for the reference material. The temperature difference between the two wells was measured by a copper<onstantan thermocouple encapsulated in a stainless-steel sheath and was recorded on a strip chart as a function of temperature. The apparatus was designed for the temperature range between 90 and 400 K. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to the sample crystals using helium gas as the pressure-transmitting medium. The pressure range of the measurement was between 0. \n\nPm3m\nStructures are determined by Poglitsch et al.  [3]  and transition temperatures are determined by the authors  [5] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs indicated by the scales (and by the increased noise level in the base line of the curves) in Figs  4  and 5 , the peak heights of these transitions are much smaller than those of the other transitions shown before. This is because the I4/mcm -Pm3m transitions of both crystals are of a gradual type and the first-order component of the transition entropy is only 46% of the total  [5] . The peak temperature decreased monotonically and the peak shape became broader with increasing pressure for MAPbBr,. For MAPbI,, however, the transition line had a maximum around 110 MPa, below which the slope dT,,/dp was positive and above which negative. The peak shape and area did not change significantly in the whole pressure range.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In most cases when noninvasive imaging is not used, studies assume a consistent baseline condition in rats that lack visible differences. While performing a series of traumatic brain injury studies, we discovered mild spontaneous ventriculomegaly in 70 (43.2%) of 162 Wistar rats that had been obtained from 2 different vendors. Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, including MR angiography and diffusion tensor imaging, were used to evaluate the rats. Multiple neuropathologic abnormalities, including presumed arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, cysts, white matter lesions, and astrogliosis were found in association with ventriculomegaly. Postmortem microcomputed tomography and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Diffusion tensor imaging showed significant decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in multiple white matter tracts (p < 0.05). These results could impact the interpretation, for example, of a pseudo-increase of axon integrity and a pseudo-decrease of myelin integrity, based on characteristics intrinsic to rats with ventriculomegaly. We suggest the use of baseline imaging to prevent the inadvertent introduction of a high degree of variability in preclinical studies of neurologic disease or injury in Wistar rats. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMR techniques including T 2 -weighted, T 2 *-weighted, DTI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (in subset of animals) were performed to diagnose the abnormality in vasculature and white matter. Postmortem micro-CT and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were also performed to verify the imaging findings and inspect the spontaneous anomalies in the CNS of the ventriculomegaly Wistar rats. The presence of these spontaneous ventriculomegaly patterns may be associated with abnormal vasculature, including aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Baseline scans are critical to exclude animals with ventriculomegaly and AVM anomalies to ensure consistent and reliable animal models of CNS diseases.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nAnimal and Ventriculomegaly Rating Scale\nEight-week-old Wistar rats purchased from Charles River (n = 134, female) and Harlan Laboratories (n = 28, including 22 female and 6 male) were examined. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at our institution. Anatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition. Each animal's baseline brain MRI studies were reviewed independently by 3 investigators assessing the scans for any ventricular dilatation, asymmetrical ventricles, aqueduct stenosis, arachnoid cysts, cyst-like lesions, hyperintense lesions and otherwise unidentified bright objects. Animals without brain anomalies on baseline MRI were considered normal. The volume of ventricles or the hyperintense CSF compartments were quantified using National Institutes of Health ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) software and normalized to the volume of brain section at the same slices for cross comparison over each animal. A CSF compartment rating scale was applied to evaluate the ventricular and cystic abnormalities.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe inhalant anesthetic was delivered to the animal through a custom-made nose cone. Throughout MR scans, warm water was circulated under the animals to keep them warm at 37\u00b0C; a steady respiratory rate was monitored using a pressure sensor (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY), and maintained at 40 to 50 breaths/minute by isoflurane/oxygen mixture. For the baseline scan, high-resolution RARE MRI was first performed on every rat to acquire the anatomical T 2 -weighted images (TR 3.8 s, TE 15 ms, RARE factor 8, field of view [FOV] 2.56 \u00d7 2.56 [cm], matrix 256 \u00d7 256, in-plane resolution 100 \u00d7 100 [\u03bcm] with 0.5-mm thickness, number of excitation [NEX] 4, scan time 8 minutes). Thirty slices were acquired to cover the brain from olfactory bulb to cervical spinal cord to screen for ventriculomegaly.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The solvents used were \u03b3\u2010butyrolactone (BL), propylene carbonate (PC), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the salts included and . Cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes was correlated to their surface chemistry and morphology in the various solvent systems. The effects of both water and oxygen contamination were rigorously studied. It was found that the presence of oxygen in solutions considerably increased the cycling efficiency of the lithium electrode. This effect correlates well with the influence of the presence of oxygen on the surface morphology of lithium electrodes in solutions. The presence of water increases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in PC, and decreases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in ethers. These results are discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in the various solvent systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSEM measurements were carried out with JSM 840 scanning electron microscope (JEOL).

An initial amount of lithium (several coulombs per cm 2) was deposited on a nickel or copper electrode. Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2 . A periodic galvanostatic operation of the cell described in Fig.  1  was carried out by triggering the PAR (Model 173) potentiostat (set to galvanostatie mode) by a square waveform generator built specially for these experiments. ,Spectroscopic measurements.--The FTIR measurements of Li electrodes are described in detail elsewhere  (11) (12) (13) . Tile SEM measurements were conducted as follows. After the electrochemical treatments, the electrodes were taken out of the cell, washed (pure solvent) and dried (evacuation). Pieces were cut from each electrode and were loaded on the transfer system built specially for this work. Figure  3  shows the transfer system built for the SEM studies. The samples are loaded in the glove box on the Galvanostatlc charge-discharge cycling, 0.5 mA/cm 2. The charge involved in initial lithium deposition was about 2.5 C/cm 2. The last process was dissolution of the residual lithium. The dashed line indicates uncontaminated solution, and the solid line, oxygen-saturated solution. sample tray  [11]  (see Fig.  3 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAfter cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency. Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc  [1]  where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively. The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +.

A lithium-sulfur cell with a nanostructured anode is created with a high Coulombic efficiency and high capacity retention rate of 36.3% after 2000 cycles. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 25 ]  However, a large quantity of micro-sized Li dendrites is observed in case of plate Li metal anode while the nanostructured metallic Li anode is dendritefree when applying a huge current density of 10 mA cm -2 based on the surface of fl at electrode (Figure  3 e, f ). For plate Li metal electrode, the huge uptake of current results in strong local electrical fi eld and extremely high concentration gradient of Li ions as driven force for high throughput transportation of electrons from electrode and ions from electrolyte, which is benefi cial for the dendrite growth. While for the nanostructured metallic Li anode, its 3D nanostructure with abundant electrode/electrolyte interfaces lower the absolute local current density even though applying the same current as Li anode. Thus both the gradients of electrical fi eld and Li ion concentration at local regions are reduced to orders of magnitude towards increased Sand's time and dendritefree morphology.  [ 9, 30 ]  Also, due to the nanosized matrix, the growth of Li crystal is also self-restricted in principles shown in Figure  1  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBeyond the size effect of the Li deposits, the 3D fi brous structure of Li 7 B 6 provides free space to accommodate electrolyte to reduce the concentration gradient of Li ions,  [ 26 ]  therefore, the formation of Li dendrites is suppressed. The 3D nanostructured anode with dendrite-free morphology and highly stable interfaces between the electrode and electrolyte could serve as a promising anode candidate for high-energy-density systems with good security. The nanostructured anode with metallic Li contained in fi brous Li 7 B 6 matrix reported herein is fabricated from thermal reaction and composed of free Li and alloyed Li with chemical formula of Li 7 B 6 \u20227.6Li. The electrochemical phase evolution and corresponding structural properties of nanostructured anode at different charge/discharge stages were probed.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, once the Li deposit initiates, it would grow continuously because Li deposit in the initial time is with a small size that holds a strong electric fi eld strength, thus favoring the adsorption and deposition of lithium ions (Figure  1 b ). When the Li deposit size is beyond that of the matrix, Li + adsorption and deposition ability of the deposits will be below the matrix and then Li + deposits on the matrix rather than on the dendrites continually. Thus, the nanostructured LiB alloy anode not only reduces the current density, which decreases the growth velocity of Li deposits, but also limits the fi nal size of deposited Li on the nanostructured matrix, which leads to the dendrite-free morphology at macroscale (Figure  1 c ). Consequently, the Li deposits on the nanostructured anode with metallic Li embeded in fi brous Li 7 B 6 matrix are always with smaller size than that on the plate Li metal anode.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Plasmonics \u2014 a rapidly emerging subdiscipline of nanophotonics \u2014 is aimed at exploiting both localized and propagating surface plasmons for technologically important applications, specifically in sensing and waveguiding. Here we present a brief overview of this rapidly growing research field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThinner (thicker) shells have a stronger (weaker) interaction, leading to larger (smaller) energy splitting of the symmetric and antisymmetric plasmon modes. Therefore PH theory provides an elegant and more intuitive plasmon description and has become a useful guide in the engineering of metallic nanostructures with predictable resonances when applied to other complex geometries with interacting plasmons. first performed using propagating surface plasmons on continuous metal films that had been chemically functionalized. Modifications in the chemical environment due to binding of molecules to a functionalized film were monitored as a change in the incidence angle required for surface plasmon excitation in an evanescent coupling geometry  26  . Similarly, metallic nanoparticles that support the excitation of a localized SPR are also highly sensitive to the environment, because the resonance frequency depends on the dielectric constant of the local medium (for example see Fig.  2c  and refs 4,7). In nanoparticle-based SPR sensing, changes in the dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the metallic nanostructure are detected by measuring the shift of the SPR absorbance maximum (see Fig.  2c  and refs 26,27).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2c  and refs 26,27). This enables the detection of molecules with different dielectric properties at the nanoparticle surface. Although the SPR response is not chemically specific, this disadvantage has been overcome by detection techniques using metal particles conjugated to, for example, antibodies or DNA, allowing for that selectivity of target-receptor molecules through binding specificities  28, 29  . For example, the highly robust biotin-streptavidin labelling scheme has been used extensively for plasmon sensing in biological systems. Although SPR spectroscopy using nanoparticles is less sensitive at present than its thin-film-based analogue, it has the advantages of portability (that is, the technique can be miniaturized) and affordability  28  ($5,000 versus $300,000).\n\nLocaL fieLd enhancement\nWhen an electromagnetic wave interacts with a roughened metallic surface or a nanoparticle, the electromagnetic fields near the surface are greatly enhanced relative to the incident electromagnetic field. This phenomenon is due to two processes. The first is the 'lightning rod' effect, conventionally described as the crowding of the electric field lines at a sharp metallic tip.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFurthermore, metallic-dielectric and metallic-metallic core-shell nanoparticles and mixed metallic-alloy nanoparticles with different shapes (for example, nanoshells  [14] [15] [16]  and nanorice  17  ) have been prepared. Fabrication of this large variety of different structures makes a variety of applications possible, as the spectral position of the surface plasmon resonance depends on both the shape and the size of the nanoparticle. For spherical nanoparticles, a resonance of the oscillating electrons with an incident optical wave occurs when the negative of the real part of the particle's dielectric constant equals twice the value of the dielectric constant of the medium (see theoretical section below). However, for non-spherical particle shapes, the electron oscillation is non-isotropic and localized either along the principal axes  18  or at the edges and corners of the nanoparticle  19  (or both), leading to an additional shape-dependent depolarization and splitting of the surface plasmon resonance into several modes (such as longitudinal and transverse modes for nanorods or symmetric and antisymmetric modes in nanoshells  20  ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this work, we demonstrate that a plasmonic resonance in top-down nanofabricated yttrium antennas can be completely and reversibly turned on and off using hydrogen exposure. We fabricate arrays of yttrium nanorods and optically observe, in extinction spectra, the hydrogen-induced phase transition between the metallic yttrium dihydride and the insulating trihydride. Whereas the yttrium dihydride nanostructures exhibit a pronounced particle plasmon resonance, the transition to yttrium trihydride leads to a complete vanishing of the resonant behavior. The plasmonic resonance in the dihydride state can be tuned over a wide wavelength range by simply varying the size of the nanostructures. Furthermore, we develop an analytical diffusion model to explain the temporal behavior of the hydrogen loading and unloading trajectories observed in our experiments and gain information about the thermodynamics of our device. Thus, our nanorod system serves as a versatile basic building block for active plasmonic devices ranging from switchable perfect absorbers to active local heating control elements. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDue to its high refractive index, YH 3 could even act as high-index nanophotonic material (n \u2248 2.8 at 600 nm  31, 52  ) which supports electric and magnetic Mie resonances  53, 54  that can be switched on and off using hydrogen. Other transition metals such as vanadium  55  or scandium, or transition metal alloys like Mg-Y, Mg-La, Mg-Sc, and Mg-Gd may provide even faster response.  [56] [57] [58] [59]  Complete blackness and thus highest switching contrast could be expected using nickel metal hydrides (such as Mg 2 MeH x , with Me = Ni, Co, Fe).  60  Finally, studies of the Mott-Hubbard metalto-insulator phase transition in rare earth and lanthanide hydride nanostructures as a function of structure size, morphology, and so forth, will enable a whole family of intriguing experiments.\n\n\u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n* S Supporting Information Optical characterization, details of the diffusion model, and description of the extinction simulations and the dielectric function modeling.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDespite the advantage of much faster switching times, they can often be used only in hybrid plasmonic systems, that is, in combination with gold or other good plasmonic metals. However, the use of hybrid systems drastically lowers the switching contrast, since only the dielectric environment of the resonant material changes and not the antenna itself. Therefore, yttrium dihydride is a highly relevant and very promising alternative for plasmonic applications that require a high switching contrast and are less dependent on ultrashort switching times. Furthermore, as a metal, yttrium and its hydrides can be structured easily using standard nanofabrication techniques. During hydrogen absorption, metallic yttrium (Y) transforms first into yttrium dihydride (YH 2 , Figure  1a ), which has an even higher electrical conductivity than pure yttrium. This phase change from a metal in hcp configuration into a fcc metal is nonreversible under normal conditions. Through further exposure to hydrogen, it undergoes a second, reversible, phase change into yttrium trihydride (YH 3 , Figure  1b ), a transparent semiconductor with a hcp structure.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn fact, yttrium hydride is one of the few strongly correlated systems with a continuous Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition.  37, 38  The particle plasmon resonance fully vanishes, and the extinction spectrum becomes almost flat, as shown by the blue line in Figure  2 . This proves that it is possible to completely turn off the plasmon resonance by introducing only small and safe amounts of hydrogen into the system. The switching results in a relative extinction change at the peak wavelength (1720 nm) of almost 70%, which translates to an absolute change in transmittance of 23% that can easily be observed by the naked eye. To incorporate yttrium nanostructures into switchable plasmonic devices, the ability to tune the plasmon resonance over a wide spectral range is needed. Here, the simplest approach is to vary the length of the plasmonic nanorods while leaving width and height constant. Consequently, we fabricated yttrium rod arrays with a constant width w of 160 nm and height h of 50 nm yttrium covered with 6 nm platinum, while varying the length from 290 to 385 nm.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I(1-x)Br(x))3 (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of \u03b3-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThird, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min (Fig.  1b ). As is apparent from Supplementary Fig.  1 , the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate (Supplementary Fig.  1a ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1a ). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 \u2022 C (Supplementary Fig.  1b ). Here, the crystallinity of the perovskite films is almost the same regardless of the toluene drop-casting, as can be seen in values of full-width at half-maximum of (110) XRD peaks of Supplementary Fig.  2 . Therefore, the solvent-engineering technique is critically important for this process. To gain further insight into the mixed-solvent application and subsequent toluene drip treatment, we isolated the intermediate phase formed by pouring MAI and PbI 2 dissolved in GBL and DMSO into toluene.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEvaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions. Generally, \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL), N ,N -dimethylformamide, DMSO and N -methyl-2pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI. However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area \n20  , although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents. Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer  10  , and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO 2 base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process. Furthermore, it was reported that the uniformity of the perovskite films depended on the thickness of the TiO 2 compact layer, and modification of the spinning conditions could not achieve 100% surface coverage  20  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n4.1.7. Find ligands. The automatic fitting of ligands into electron-density maps is a frequently used technique that is particularly useful for pharmaceutical crystallographers (see, for example,  Williams et al., 2005) . The mechanism in Coot addresses a number of ligand-fitting scenarios and is a modified form of a previously described algorithm  (Oldfield, 2001) . It is common practice in 'fragment screening' to soak different ligands into the same crystal  (Blundell et al., 2002) . Using Coot one can either specify a region in space or search a whole asymmetric unit for either a single or a number of different ligand types. In the 'whole-map' scenario, candidate ligand sites are found by cluster analysis of a residual map. The candidate ligands are fitted in turn to each site (with the candidate orientations being generated by matching the eigenvectors of the ligand to that of the cluster). Each candidate ligand is fitted and scored against the electron density. The best-fitting orientation of the ligand candidates is chosen. Ligands often contain a number of rotatable bonds.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe standard data names for some common crystallographic software are provided in Table  1 . SHELX .fcf files are converted to mmCIF format and the space group is then inferred from the symmetry operators.\n\nModel building\nInitial building of protein structures from experimental phasing is usually accomplished by automated methods such as ARP/wARP, RESOLVE  (Wang et al., 2004)  and Buccaneer  (Cowtan, 2006) . However, most of these methods rely on a resolution of better than 2.5 A \u02daand yield more complete models the better the resolution. The main focus in Coot, therefore, is the completion of initial models generated by either molecular replacement or automated model building as well as building of lower resolution structures. However, the features described below are provided for cases where an initial model is not available.\n\nTools for general model building\n4.1.1. C a baton mode. Baton building, which was introduced by  Kleywegt & Jones (1994) , allows a protein main chain to be built by using a 3.8 A \u02da'baton' to position successive C atoms at the correct spacing.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPDB and mmCIF files are handled using the MMDB library  (Krissinel et al., 2004) , which is also used for internal model manipulations. 3.7.2. Electron density. The electron-density representation is a significant element of the design of the software. Coot employs a 'crystal space' representation of the electron density, in which the electron density is practically infinite in extent, in accordance with the lattice repeat and cell symmetry of the crystal. Thus, no matter where the viewpoint is located in space density can always be represented. This design decision is achieved by use of the Clipper libraries  (Cowtan, 2003) . The alternative approach is to just display electron density in a bounded box described by the input electron-density map. This approach is simpler and may be more appropriate in some specific cases (e.g. when displaying density from cryo-EM experiments or some types of NCS maps). However, it has the limitation that no density is available for symmetry-related molecules and if the initial map has been calculated with the wrong extent then it must be recalculated in order to view the desired regions.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

By combining two short perpendicularly polarized pulses with frequencies centered at \u03c91 and \u03c92, where (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92)/\u03c91 \u226a 1, we can create a pulse with polarization that sweeps from circular through linear back to circular. It is possible to make the duration of the segment of the pulse capable of emitting short-wavelength radiation so small that emission is possible only for a time less than the period of the fundamental. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAll dispersion characteristics of this filter are known, 8 and a 200.0-nmthick silver film will increase the pulse duration by a maximum of 0.1 fs. We emphasize that the conditions assumed above are experimentally feasible. Phase-related beams with frequencies co, and w) 2 can be selected from an ultrashort laser pulse. The 800-nm light was chosen because, at this wavelength, pulses with durations of only ten optical periods are now generated' 2 and amplified.1 2 Two frequency bands near awl and \u00a302 can be selected by use of standard techniques.  9  The bandwidth of the two components can easily be broad enough to permit the synthesized pulse to fall sufficiently in intensity before the linear polarization condition can reappear, thus ensuring that harmonic emission is very weak at all times except near t = 0. Measurement of the time duration of subfemtosecond pulses also seems feasible. Since it is as complex as the production process it will be addressed elsewhere.'  3  Our approach to attosecond pulse generation is a special case of a much more general phenomenon, namely, coherent control of strong-field atomic processes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSince the development of the laser, obtaining shorter and shorter pulses has been a major emphasis of laser science. To approach the limit of 10 fs, at which short-pulse lasers currently operate,\" 2 nonresonant (Kerr) nonlinearities are used. However, the development of short-pulse coherent sources of less than 1-fs duration will require shorter-wavelength radiation and a new nonlinearity. In this Letter we introduce a method for producing pulses with durations approaching 1 atomic unit of time based on highharmonic emission from atomic gases.\nHigh harmonics have been extensively studied.  3  Their discrete nature and broad envelope spectrum implies that, if the harmonics are appropriately phased, a train of very short (-10 as) pulses separated by one half of the fundamental period will result.  4  In analogy with lasers, it is not sufficient to have equally spaced modes of an oscillator; they must be locked in the appropriate relative phase. Aside from phase-matching issues, the harmonic emission of a quantum system is determined by the squared modulus of the second time derivative of the dipole moment. Therefore the problem is to find the dipole moment as a function of time.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTherefore the problem is to find the dipole moment as a function of time. It was shown 5 ' 6 that, in the intense field regime in which the energy of the free-electron oscillation in the laser field is greater than the ionization potential, one can understand the high-order nonlinear response of an atom by considering the following three steps: (1) In the process of ionizing, the atom releases an electron wave packet into the continuum. (2)  In the direction of the laser field the electron follows a trajectory that is first away from the ion and then comes back toward the ion. Quantum effects (spreading of the electron wave packet) dominate in the direction perpendicular to the field. (3)  Those electrons that return to the vicinity of the ion emit harmonic radiation in a coherent interaction between the portion of the wave function remaining in the ground state and the returning portion (coherent spontaneous recombination to the ground state). In what follows we use the semiclassical version of this model 5 to describe the approach to producing attosecond pulses.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage size of 3.8 nm and the highest pore volume of 2.8 cm(3) g(-1) among reported Zr-MOFs. Moreover, PCN-777 shows excellent stability in aqueous environments, which makes it an ideal candidate as a support to incorporate different functional moieties. Through facile internal surface modification, the interaction between PCN-777 and different guests can be varied to realize efficient immobilization. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nmechanical and the chemical stability of the framework decrease gradually. \n[3]  Furthermore, the working environments of those immobilized moieties are usually harsh, which requires the frameworks to be chemically very stable. The requirement of a combination of good chemical stability and large pores means that very few candidates are widely utilized. MIL-101 and MIL-100 are two extraordinary examples that exhibit both properties and are suitable supports.  [4]  MIL-100 and MIL-101, both of which have zeotype mtn topology (zeotype refers to structures sharing the same topology with zeolites), contain super-tetrahedral cages to substitute for the tetrahedral unit in zeolites.  [5]  Hence, their largest pores reach 31\u00c5 and 29\u00c5 respectively although the organic linkers are relatively small. Moreover, the metal nodes in these MOFs are based on trivalent metal species. The strong interaction between carboxylates and high valent metal species accompanied with the small organic linker endows these frameworks with excellent chemical stability. Despite these advantages, the pore size still restricts further application of these MOFs when it comes to larger guests such as nanoparticles or enzymes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, synthesis of mesoporous materials with larger pore size which also maintain excellent chemical stability is highly desired. Application of a ligand larger than those in the MIL-100 and MIL-101 MOFs to create zeotype frameworks would be an effective way to generate extra-large pores, while avoiding complicated organic synthesis to make the linker extremely large. Unfortunately, there are several challenges in the way of extending these mtn topological MOFs: First, the M 3 O(COO) 6 (M= Fe(III), Al(III), Cr(III), In(III), V(III), Sc(III)) building block is not the thermodynamically favored form, which makes the controllable formation of target products difficult;  [6]  second, even if the inorganic building block can be obtained, competitive framework isomers, such as the MIL-88 structure, still dominate as the major products; moreover, most of the synthesis needs to be conducted under hydrothermal conditions, which is infeasible for large organic linkers with poor water solubility. Therefore, searching for other zeotype frameworks, which can be synthetically controlled more easily, is one promising strategy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHighly stable mesoporous Zr-MOF: Through a topology rationalization, we designed and synthesized a zeotype mesoporous Zr-MOF, PCN-777. PCN-777 exhibits cages as large as 3.8 nm and excellent stability in aqueous environments, which make it an ideal candidate as a support to incorporate different functional moieties.

By using \u03b1-Fe2O3/Ppy as the anode materials with iron foil as the current collector, the unique structure affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/diintercalation for Li-ion battery. A relatively high specific capacity of 0.42 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at 0.1 mA/cm2 even after 100 charge/discharge cycles, with a plateau potential of 1 V and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, suggesting the feasibility to use this unique 3D nanostructured hybrid composite for microbattery in both small and large scale applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe appearance of the strong peak at 1590 cm \u00c01 , weak peaks at 982 cm \u00c01 and 930 cm \u00c01 , which are assigned to C =C backbone stretching and ring-in plane deformation of PPY, respectively, indicating the successful polymerization of polypyrrole  [16] .

However, catalytic application of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) for Suzuki coupling of aryl chlorides is still a challenge. Here, we design a novel catalyst by combining Pd NPs with Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocrystals for Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling of aryl chlorides.

To ensure Pd 2+ was not adsorbed but doped, the nanocatalyst was washed with deionized water several times and then dissolved in nitromuriatic acid for the ICP test. The ICP test results show that the Pd-Co molar ratio is 2.94 : 1, while the Pd-Co molar ratio of the reactant was 5 : 4, which demonstrate that the Pd 2+ was not adsorbed but doped in the nanocatalyst.

About four hours later, the solid products were collected by centrifugation and were washed with water several times. The products were dried under vacuum. The solid product was dissolved in concentrated nitric acid and analyzed by using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) to determine the content of Pd (47.9 wt%).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs shown in Fig.  5a  and 5b , the adsorption and desorption isotherms of Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 and Pd-Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 are also quite similar.

In particular, a low overpotential (\u03b710 = 124 and 77 mV at a current density of \u221210 mA cm\u22122), a small Tafel slope (43 and 50 mV dec\u22121) and a high exchange current density (j0 = 0.015 and 0.212 mA cm\u22122) are achieved on nanoMoC@GS in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Such remarkable activity, outperforming most current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, stems from the cooperative/synergistic effects of ultrafine MoC nanostructure, ultrathin and conductive graphitized carbon shells, and enriched porosity. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high-performance electrocatalysts via converting \u201catomic contact\u201d hybrid structures (e.g., MOFs), illustrating a new perspective for developing nanocatalysts in the energy chemistry field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS6 . \u2020 NanoMoC@GS(700) structure and particle size distribution of the MoC nanoparticles showed only slight changes, con\ue103rming the superior stability of this electrocatalyst, which resulted from the con\ue103ned geometry (ultra\ue103ne MoC nanoparticles encapsulated by graphitized carbon shells) in this material. We then used EIS to provide further insight into electrode kinetics of the obtained materials. As shown in Fig.  6a , nano-MoC@GS(700) presented a much lower charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) value (14.5 U) than nanoMoC@GS(800) (28.6 U) and nanoMoC@GS(900) (69.5 U), indicating a faster electron transfer rate in the HER process. This lower R ct should be related to the con\ue103ned geometry in nanoMoC@GS materials, which would enhance the close interface contract of MoC nanoparticles with the ultrathin graphitized carbon shell and allow rapid charge transfer kinetics during the electrochemical process by improving the conductivity of electrocatalysts.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe lowest R ct value for nanoMoC@GS(700) might result from its relatively large quantity of graphitized carbon (Table  S1  \u2020). EIS for nanoMoC@GS(700) at various HER overpotentials from 75 to 200 mV in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 is provided in Fig.  S7 . \u2020 The corresponding Nyquist and Bode plots of the EIS response of nanoMoC@GS(700) are given in Fig.  6b , and two peaks could be detected in the curves. The \ue103rst one with potential-dependent properties at low frequencies could be attributed to kinetics of the HER process; while another at high frequencies with the same intensity suggested that this electrocatalyst processed an abundant porosity,  13  which was in agreement with N 2 -sorption experimental results. It has been widely demonstrated that different electrocatalysts have varying optimal mass loadings for HER.  15, 16, 20  The optimal mass loading of nanoMoC@GS(700) was also investigated. Results (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3, 13  By extrapolating the Tafel plot, the exchange current density (j 0 ) of nanoMoC@GS(700) was calculated as 13.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 mA cm \u00c02 , which was also much higher than that of the other two samples derived from higher temperatures (Table  S2  \u2020), re\ue104ecting the lower reaction resistance in this former sample. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is directly related to the HER activity, but its accurate measurement for MoC x is difficult due to its unclear capacitive behavior.  21, 22  Hence, the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (C dl ) measured by the CV method (Fig.  S5 \u2020 ) were widely applied to evaluate relative ECSA of the catalysts. As expected, given its highest HER activity, nanoMoC@GS(700) did show the largest C dl value of 66.6 mF cm \u00c02 (Fig.  5c ), implying that this sample had a much higher ECSA than the samples prepared at higher carburization temperatures.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Recently, we and others identified the RET fusion gene as a new targetable driver gene in LADC. The RET fusions occur in 1-2% of LADCs. Existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of RET tyrosine kinase show promising therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as in a few patients.

This is possible using conjugate-gradient techniques for energy minimization, and predicting the wave functions for new ionic positions using subspace alignment. This approach avoids the instabilities inherent in quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations for metals based on the use of a fictitious Newtonian dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity and allows us to perform simulations over several picoseconds. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nIn recent years, ab initio calculations based on the local density approximation (LDA) (for a recent review see, for example, Ref.  [1] ) have been of increased interest. The reasons for this development are evident: LDA offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy and efficiency in treating electronic many-body effects, is completely parameterfree, and with the enormous increase in computer power complex calculations are now feasible. Using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem  [2] , the calculation of forces is in principle straight forward and, for a basis set such as plane waves, relatively simple. The forces offer the possibility of relaxing atoms into their ground-state or of performing ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. With the computers now available, calculations for systems containing more than 100 particles are practicable, and the development of faster parallel computers offers a bright future for ab initio techniques. We have recently implemented a powerful LDA plane wave program (Vienna ab initio molecular dynamics simulation package (VAMP) -for a detailed description see Ref.  [3] ) which can be used to perform complex calculations for many problems (i.e., bulk, surfaces, liquid systems, molecules).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNevertheless, relaxing the norm-conservation constraint results in a charge-deficit between the pseudo-and the exact all-electron wavefunctions, which must be described using localized augmentation functions Qji(r). Second, an overlap operator has to be included in the orthonormality constraint and the KS eigenequations. Explicit formulas for the KS functional, the Hamiltonian, the forces and the stress tensor can be found in Refs.  [3, 25] . Our pseudopotentials (NC as well as US) are constructed using a modified Rappe scheme  [26] . Details can be found in Refs.  [3, 15, 27] .\n\nForces, relaxation and ab initio MD\nUsing forces and stresses, the relaxation into the instantaneous ionic groundstate is simple and is performed by applying conjugate gradient techniques or quasi-Newton algorithms  [28] . Ab initio MD simulations are possible as well. Due to our efficient minimization techniques, the exact evaluation of the finite temperature LDA groundstate is possible at each timestep, allowing us to use a much larger timestep than in CP calculations (the timestep within the CP-framework is restricted by the electronic kinetics).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nof the experiment is not as good as for Na. Fig.  2  shows the DOS for Li. To improve the accuracy of the k-point sampling, we have also carried out calculations for a small number of configurations on a 6 X 6 X 6 grid in the irreducible wedge of the simple cubic-BZ (10 k-points). The resulting DOS is smooth and shows the narrowing of the occupied part of the band and the structure induced DOS-minimum just above E r. Our calculation also leads to a good description of the dynamical properties, e.g., the self-diffusion constant D = 0.7 X 10 -4 cm 2 s -1 is in excellent agreement with experimental data D = 0.65 X 10 -4 cm 2 s -1  [35] .\n\nTransition metals\nThe simulation of transition metals is a challenging task  [36] , and calculations are feasible using the US pseudopotentials, discussed in Section 2.5.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, despite its ability to control matter with near-atomic precision, the technique is overlooked in most histories of nanoscience and nanotechnology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn fact, the word 'epitaxy' comes from the Greek for 'above' (epi) and 'in an ordered manner' (taxis). The origins of MBE lie in the convergence of a number of research areas including solid-state physics, surface physics and materials science in the early 1950s. In 1954, for example, two years after finishing his physics doctorate at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Herbert Kroemer had a post at the Central Telecommunications Laboratory run by the German Postal Service in Darmstadt. As the theorist in a small semiconductor research group, he proposed \"a non-stoichiometric mixed crystal of different semiconductors with different energy gaps\"  6     \n\nBUILDING NEW NANOSTRUCTURES\nThroughout the 1960s, researchers grappled with the challenge of making new crystalline materials for semiconductor applications. A good deal of the most significant work was done at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, between 1968 and 1973.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n9  . At first, however, they could only produce a few hundred angstroms of GaAs per day, grown in layers that were too thin to accurately characterize. Over at IBM, meanwhile, Leo Esaki and Ray Tsu were grappling with a theoretical concept known as a superlattice. Whereas the heterostructures proposed by Kroemer contained just two layers of different materials, superlattices could be made of many very thin layers of two or more different semiconductors. Moreover, if a superlattice could be built with layers that were shorter than the mean free path of the electrons, a series of allowed and forbidden energy bands would be created in the device. Esaki and Tsu argued that this could prove to be \"a valuable area of investigation in the field of semiconductors\"  10  . However, when they submitted their first paper on this topic to a journal, it was rejected on the grounds that it was too speculative with \"no new physics\". (The first paper on the STM was rejected for similar reasons 2 .) Luckily for Esaki and Tsu the Army Research Office thought differently and supported their superlattice research for several years.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nincrementally improved MBE technology, introducing refinements such as computer-controlled shutter systems and in situ monitoring.\n\nAN MBE COMMUNITY EMERGES\nOne of the young experimentalists attracted to MBE was Arthur C. Gossard, who arrived at Bell Labs in 1960 after getting his doctorate in physics from Berkeley. At first he continued to study ferromagnetic and superconducting materials with nuclear and electron resonance techniques. Around 1973, however, managers at Bell Labs encouraged him to study defects in semiconductors, especially those used for laser applications. It was the need to fabricate samples for this research that led him to MBE. However, managers initially discouraged him, saying that MBE was too complex for a neophyte to take on. Within a few years, however, Gossard's small group was publishing papers describing the nanoscale semiconductor structures they had built with their rudimentary equipment  12  . By the late 1970s, Gossard's team, like researchers at other labs, were experimenting with a technique that became known as modulation doping (Fig.  2 ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The general synthesis strategy is based on a sol-gel process associated with nonionic block copolymer as templates in ethanol solvent. Small-angle XRD, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption results show that these mesoporous aluminas possess a highly ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure, which is resistant to high temperature up to 1000 degrees C. Ordered mesoporous structures with tunable pore sizes are obtained with various precursors, different acids as pH adjustors, and different block copolymers as templates. These mesoporous aluminas have large surface areas (ca. 400 m2/g), pore volumes (ca. 0.70 cm3/g), and narrow pore-size distributions. The influence of the complexation ability of anions and hydro-carboxylic acid, acid volatility, and other important synthesis conditions are discussed in detail. Utilizing this simple strategy, we also obtained partly ordered mesoporous alumina with hydrous aluminum nitrate as the precursor. FTIR pyridine adsorption measurements indicate that a large amount of Lewis acid sites exist in these mesoporous aluminas. These materials are expected to be good candidates in catalysis due to the uniform pore structures, large surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and large amounts of surface Lewis acid sites. Loaded with ruthenium, the representative mesoporous alumina exhibits reactant size selectivity in hydrogenation of acetone, D-glucose, and D-(+)-cellobiose as a test reaction, indicating the potential applications in shape-selective catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThen 1.4-1.6 mL of 67 wt % nitric acid (or 1.4-1.6 mL of 37 wt % hydrochloric acid plus 0.5 g citric acid) and 2.04 g (10 mmol) of aluminum iso-propoxide were added into the above solution with vigorous stirring. The mixture was covered with PE film, stirred at room temperature for about 5 h, and then put into a 60 \u00b0C drying oven to undergo the solvent evaporation process. After 2 days of aging, the solution became a light-yellow solid (when hydrochloric acid and citric acid were used, white solids were obtained). Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0C min -1 ramping rate) and by heating at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. High-temperature treatment was carried out in air for 1 h with a temperature ramp of 10 \u00b0C min -1 . Catalyst Preparation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCatalyst Preparation. Supported ruthenium catalysts containing 2 wt % ruthenium were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of as-synthesized mesoporous Al2O3 and for comparison, commercial Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar) with an aqueous solution of Ru(NO)(NO3) (Alfa Aesar) (denoted hereinafter as ruthenium/meso-Al2O3 and ruthenium/ commerical-Al2O3, respectively) at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h. Impregnated samples were dried in ambient air at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h and then reduced under flowing H2/N2 (10/90 v/v) at 350 \u00b0C for 6 h. Characterization. PXRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-2000 diffractometer (Japan) using Cu KR radiation (\u03bb ) 1.5406 \u00c5). TEM were taken on the Hitachi H-9000 NAR transmission electron microscope under a working voltage of 300 kV.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIncidentally, corresponding smallangle XRD patterns (Figure  S5  in the Supporting Information) display that ordered mesostructures can be obtained with the CA/Al 3+ ratio in the range of 0.15 to 0.35, demonstrating that only appropriate chelation between HCAs and alumina precursors can lead to ordered assembly. We assume that volatilization behavior of the acids is an important factor that should be taken into account. The reactivity of the alumina precursors can be efficiently regulated through various methods such as careful adjustment of the pH and dilution of solutions or the use of condensation inhibitors.  37  A subsequent slowing step is necessary to irreversibly freeze a half-condensed structure and hence avoids the fast formation of an inorganic network. Inorganic hydrolysis and condensation have to be controlled to fabricate a robust mesostructure instead of a hard solid. As for our synthesis, the starting solutions are relatively dilute, and the inorganic polymerization can be readily dominated by an acid, which is subsequently removed by evaporation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The 4th edition of the WHO classification incorporates new information that has emerged from scientific and clinical studies in the interval since the publication of the 3rd edition in 2001, and includes new criteria for the recognition of some previously described neoplasms as well as clarification and refinement of the defining criteria for others. It also adds entities-some defined principally by genetic features-that have only recently been characterized. In this paper, the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia is highlighted with the aim of familiarizing hematologists, clinical scientists, and hematopathologists not only with the major changes in the classification but also with the rationale for those changes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTable  2  shows the revised AML classification. In the subgroup of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, 3 entities included in the previous edition are retained: (1) AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1; (2) AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16; 16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11; and (3) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA. However, variant RARA translocations, such as those involving ZBTB16 at 11q23, NUMA1 at 11q13, NPM1 at 5q35, or STAT5B at 17q11.2, should be diagnosed as AML with the variant partner specifically designated.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSignificant changes in the diagnosis and classification of MDS\n\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia and related precursor neoplasms\nThe previous edition of the WHO classification ushered in the era of incorporation of genetic abnormalities into diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of AML. The 4 abnormalities initially included in the subgroup \"AML with recurring genetic abnormalities\" involved rearrangements of genes (RUNX1, CBFB, RARA, and MLL) that encode transcription factors and that are associated with fairly distinct clinical and morphologic features. Since the publication of the 3rd edition of the classification, it has become more widely appreciated that multiple genetic lesions-including not only microscopically detectable chromosomal rearrangements or numerical abnormalities but also submicroscopic gene mutations-cooperate to establish the leukemic process and influence its morphologic and clinical characteristics.  76  Although rearrangements of genes that encode transcription factors may lead to impaired maturation of one or more myeloid lineages, mutations of genes such as FLT3, JAK2, RAS, or KIT that encode proteins involved in signal transduction pathways may be required for the proliferation and/or survival of the neoplastic clone.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is recommended, however, that the cytogenetic abnormality be included in the diagnostic report, for example, \"therapy-related AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23).\" Acute myeloid leukemia, not otherwise specified (AML, NOS) encompasses those cases that do not fulfill the criteria for any of the other AML categories. This category accounts for only 25% to 30% of all cases, and it will continue to diminish as more genetic subgroups are recognized. One of the lively discussions at the CAC meeting was whether to recommend continued subclassification within this group by criteria similar to those of the previous French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme for AML, or to designate all such cases merely as AML, NOS.

The theory generalizes previous treatments of the effects of gain and openness described by the Petermann factor. The linewidth is expressed using quantities based on the nonlinear scattering matrix, which can be computed from steady-state ab initio laser theory; unlike previous treatments, no passive cavity or phenomenological parameters are involved. We find that low cavity quality factor, combined with significant dielectric dispersion, can cause substantial deviations from the Shawlow-Townes-Petermann theory. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe third correction and the main focus of this Letter is the Petermann factor, K. First discovered in the context of transverse gain-guided semiconductor lasers  [4]  and subsequently generalized  [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , this factor arises from the non-Hermitian nature of the laser wave equation, due to the presence of the gain medium as well as the openness of the laser cavity (i.e. spatially non-uniform outcoupling loss). It always leads to an enhancement of the linewidth, even with uniform gain and no gain-guiding. Typically, it is calculated from the non-orthogonal passive cavity resonances as K = dr |\u03d5(r)| 2 dr \u03d5(r) 2 2 , (2) where the integrals are taken over the cavity  [11] . In effect, the Petermann factor changes the ST linewidth by the replacement \u03b3 2 c \u2192 K\u03b3 2 c . This is a significant correction for lasers with large outcoupling, in the range 1.1-1.6 for the conventional semiconductor lasers studied in Ref.  [2] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[2] . We shall refer to the standard theory, inclusive of the Petermann factor, as the Schawlow-Townes-Petermann (STP) theory. The extensive and impressive literature on the Petermann factor  [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 12 ] has, with one major exception  [9] , only treated single-mode lasing near threshold, neglecting the effects of spatial hole-burning. And apart from a recent paper by Schomerus  [12] , the literature has exclusively treated one-dimensional or waveguide lasers, and thus is not directly applicable to the wide variety of complex laser cavities developed during the past twenty years, such as microdisk and deformed-disk, photonic crystal, and random lasers. In this Letter, we derive a general formula for the intrinsic laser linewidth in arbitrary cavities, which is valid far from threshold, with strong spatial hole-burning, and in the multimode regime.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe zero-point contributions to \u03b8 i (t 1 )\u03b8 i (t 2 ) from the photon input and the gain medium cancel exactly, leaving FIG.  2:  (color online) Laser linewidth vs. inverse modal output power 1/P , for the two lasers studied in Fig.  1 .

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n5a ). Trinity performed well across a range of 10M to the full 150M input sequence reads, while the alternative methods tended to peak at ~50M pairs or smaller inputs (Supplementary Fig.  6a online ). In mouse (RefSeq annotation set, Fig.  5b ), Trinity (8185 transcripts, 7749 genes) outperformed the other de novo assembly methods ABySS (5561, 5500), Trans-ABySS (7025, 6598) and SOAPdenovo (761, 760), with the mapping-first programs Cufflinks (9010, 8536) and Scripture (9086, 8293) exhibiting better sensitivity. Furthermore, Trinity and Cufflinks appear best-tuned in their sensitivity across the broadest range of expression levels (Supplementary Fig.  7 online ). Unlike Trinity, several of the de novo methods did not perform well in fully reconstructing transcripts within the highest expression quintiles (Supplementary Fig.  7 online ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n9a online ). Conversely, performance of Scripture and Cufflinks using TopHat alignments in mouse exceeded that using BLAT alignments (Supplementary Fig.  9b online ). Hence, for evaluation purposes, we leveraged BLAT short read spliced alignments in S. pombe and TopHat alignments in mouse. BLAT alignments of short reads to the S. pombe genome were performed using the pipeline described above with the following settings: maximum intron length set to 500 bases, maximum distance between read pairs of 500, and only the single best alignment was reported per read. TopHat alignments to the mouse genome were performed using the following parameters: minimum intron length of 50 bases, maximum intron of 100kb, and mate inner distance set to 300 bases. Transcribed strand information was assigned to the individual reads based on knowledge of the fragment type (left or right) and the aligned strand of the genome. Both Cufflinks (version 0.9.3) 2 and Scripture 3 (version VPaperR3, obtained from Scripture author Manuel Garber) were executed on these alignments.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe evaluated Trinity on data from two well-annotated species -one microorganism (fission yeast) and one mammal (mouse) -as well as an insect (the whitefly Bemisia tabaci), whose genome has not yet been sequenced. In each case, Trinity recovers most of the reference (annotated) expressed transcripts as full-length sequences, and resolves alternative isoforms and duplicated genes, performing better than other available transcriptome de novo assembly tools, and comparably to methods relying on genome alignments.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nTrinity: a method for de novo transcriptome assembly\nTrinity is a modular method and software package, combining three components (Fig.  1 ): Inchworm, Chrysalis and Butterfly. In contrast to de novo assembly of a genome, where few large connected sequence graphs can represent connectivities among reads across entire chromosomes, in assembling transcriptome data we expect to encounter numerous individual disconnected graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at nonoverlapping loci. Accordingly, Trinity partitions the sequence data into these many individual graphs, and then processes each graph independently to extract full-length isoforms and tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify (1) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., areas of natural \"resistance\" to bleaching) and (2) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred (i.e., areas of natural community \"resilience\"). These \"target areas,\" where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus,  Salm et al. (2001)  have proposed that through thoughtful planning and strategic care of reefs within existing and future marine protected areas (MPAs)*, it may be possible to take advantage in two broad ways of the natural properties of coral reef ecosystems to mitigate the negative impact of bleaching on coral reef biodiversity: (1) Identify and manage specific patches of reef where local conditions are likely to result in reduced temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., coral assemblages with a high level of \"resistance\") to protect them from direct anthropogenic impacts. (2) Enhance the capacity for coral reef recovery (\"resilience\") by maintaining conditions optimal for larval dispersal and recruitment to damaged sites (requires minimizing other stresses at these sites [abatement of direct localized impacts] and analyzing larval dispersal [connectivity] to maximize recolonization). An understanding of which local environmental factors are predictors of greatest resistance and resilience to coral bleaching would help managers identify, design, and manage networks of MPAs in order to maximize overall survival of the world's coral reefs in the face of global climate change.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDone ( 2001 )  emphasized the importance of targeting for MPA inclusion strategic locations that maximize both strong and reliable recruitment of all species within the community and the likelihood that a portion of the propagules from those communities will effectively seed other areas. In this sense, communities with diverse populations of adult corals with high fertilization success and robust larvae (which will survive, recruit, and grow successfully) can contribute not only to their own resilience but to the resilience of other \"downstream\" communities as well. Coral reef resilience also depends on other biological components of reef communities ( i.e., a requisite variety of functional groups)  (Gunderson 2000) . For example,  Bythell et al. ( 2000 )  studied the effects of natural mortality events resulting from hurricanes at Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. They attributed the resilience of their study reefs to the presence of sufficient grazing fish populations, which kept in check the growth of macroalgae that may otherwise have out-competed coral recruits for space ( see also  Rogers 2000) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe most useful approach would be one that utilizes natural processes rather than expensive technological fixes and helps managers focus local management and enforcement efforts on the most criti-cal areas. Given the limited capacity and funding available for management in many coral-reef countries, what is especially needed are simple tractable strategies that any manager could begin to adopt immediately to maximize long-term survival of the broadest range of coral communities and reef types. We confine our discussion to local-scale resistance that occurs despite the presence of \"mass bleaching conditions\" in an area or region. This resistance is distinct from avoidance, in which large areas or regions may never be tested by bleaching conditions at all due to larger-scale climatological and oceanographic phenomena  ( Done 2001 ) . Although the latter is an important area of ongoing research, here we focus on determinants of local-scale resistance within areas or regions that have experienced bleaching conditions, because this is an important scale at which local managers work. Therefore, building on the work of  Salm et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The voom method estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear modeling and gene set testing methods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe summarized read count data is available from the voom webpage  [56] . The voom mean-variance trend shown in Figure  1a  was obtained from all 16 libraries, treated as four groups. Genes were filtered out if they failed to achieve cpm > 1 in at least four libraries, and the remaining log-cpm values were quantile normalized between libraries  [61] . The comparison between technical replicates to check the type I error rate control used only the four group B libraries. Genes were filtered out if they failed to achieve a cpm > 1 in at least two libraries and the log-cpm values for the 16,745 remaining genes were quantile normalized. Samples were separated into all possible two-versus-two and three-versus-one combinations and a limma analysis using voom weights was carried out for each partition. The false discovery rate analysis was conducted on the spike-in transcripts only. ERCC Mixes 1 and 2 contain 92 transcripts spiked in at different concentrations. For this analysis, fragments were mapped to the known sequences of the spiked-in transcripts using Subread.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nProfiles were made for 10 B6 and 11 D2 mice.

To identify the genetic alterations in this tumor type, we searched for copy number alterations using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and microRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 MBs. We found that, on average, each tumor had 11 gene alterations, fewer by a factor of 5 to 10 than in the adult solid tumors that have been sequenced to date. In addition to alterations in the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, our analysis led to the discovery of genes not previously known to be altered in MBs. Most notably, inactivating mutations of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase genes MLL2 or MLL3 were identified in 16% of MB patients. These results demonstrate key differences between the genetic landscapes of adult and childhood cancers, highlight dysregulation of developmental pathways as an important mechanism underlying MBs, and identify a role for a specific type of histone methylation in human tumorigenesis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThese genes are large and have been reported in the COSMIC database to be altered in occasional cancers, but not at a sufficiently high frequency to distinguish them from passenger alterations (and with no evidence of a high fraction of inactivating mutations)  (30) . Interestingly, inactivating germline mutations of MLL2 have recently been identified as a cause of Kabuki syndrome, a multiple malformation disorder without known cancer predisposition  (31) . The general role of genes controlling histone methylation has become increasingly recognized as a common feature of human cancers. For example, inactivating mutations of the histone H3K27 demethylase gene UTX have been observed in multiple myelomas, esophageal cancers and renal cell cancers  (32) . In addition, a small fraction of renal cell cancers contain mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2 and the histone demethylase gene JARID1C  (33) , and the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 has been found to be mutated in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas  (34) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMost recently, frequent mutations of the chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A have been discovered in ovarian clear cell carcinomas  (20, 35) ; of note, one ARID1A mutation was discovered in our MB patients (table  S4 ). A link between histone methylation genes (although not MLL2 or MLL3) and MB has also previously been hypothesized based on the observation that copy number alterations affecting chromosomal regions containing histone methyltransferases or demethylases occur in a subset of MBs  (36) . The mechanism(s) through which MLL genes contribute to tumorigenesis are not known but some clues can be gleaned from the literature. The MLL family of histone H3K4 trimethylases includes seven genes (MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, MLL5, SET1A and SET1B)  (37) . MLL-family genes have been shown to regulate HOX gene expression  (38, 39) , and an attractive possibility is that they normally downregulate OTX2, an MB oncogene  (6, 7, 40) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFourth, it is possible that low copy number gains or loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of specific regions containing histone-modifying genes could mimic the intragenic mutations that we observed  (36) . Finally, it is possible that heritable epigenetic alterations are responsible for initiating some MBs. The last explanation, involving covalent changes in chromatin proteins and DNA, is intriguing given the new data on MLL2 in this tumor type. It should thus be informative to characterize the methylation status of histones and DNA in MBs with and without MLL2/MLL3 gene alterations, as well as to determine the expression changes resulting from these gene mutations. These data highlight the important connection between genetic alterations in the cancer genome and epigenetic pathways and provide potentially new avenues for research and disease management in MB patients.    \u2020 Based on 21 nonhypermutable tumors analyzed in  (19) . \u2021 Based on 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors analyzed in  (16, 17) . \u00a7 Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total non-silent mutations.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.\nResults: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.\nAvailability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the reference-based scenario, preprocessing increased the number of uniquely aligned reads from dataset 1, as seen in the first portion of Table  1 . Filtering for both adapters and quality achieves the best result, and quality trimming is especially important when alignment settings are strict. The Maximum Information approach outperforms the Sliding Window approach in both cases, with a wider margin when the alignment mode is strict. Notably, the optimal results for strict alignment and tolerant alignment were found using widely different quality stringency settings. (See Supplementary Results for more details.) To validate these results with an alternative aligner, we repeated the experiment using BWA. Although the alignment counts differ, because of slight differences between the tools in the settings or algorithms, the overall trend is similar. The best results are again achieved when filtering for both adapters and quality, as shown in the second part of Table  1 . Dataset 2 (SRR519926) is a 2 \u00c2 250 bp run, sequenced on an MiSeq. Although read quality is high at the start of each forward read, the longer read length allows more opportunity for errors Fig.  3 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe trimming status of each read can optionally be written to a log file. This is intended to help tune the choice of processing parameters used, but because it has a significant performance impact, it is not recommended unless needed.\n\nRESULTS\nTo illustrate the value of data preprocessing, we evaluated two different scenarios: reference-based alignment using Bowtie 2  (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012)  and BWA  (Li and Durbin, 2009)  against the Escherichia coli K-12/MG1655 reference (NCBI sequence NC_000913.2), and de novo assembly using Velvet  (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) , on public E.coli K-12/ MG1655 datasets (SRA datasets SRX131047 and SRR519926), as described in the Supplementary Methods.\n\nReference-based alignment\nDataset 1 (SRX131047) represents a typical Illumina library, sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 using 2 \u00c2 100 bp reads.

How Maximum Information mode combines uniqueness, coverage and error rate to determine the optimal trimming point to accumulate in the lower quality final 60-70 bases of each read. Furthermore, the reverse read has notably poorer quality, with quality dropping significantly by approximately base 120. These quality issues can be seen clearly in the FastQC plots, shown in the Supplementary Figure  S1 , compared with the much higher average quality of the post-filtered data, as shown in Supplementary Figure  S2 . Not surprisingly, trimming is even more critical to achieving acceptable alignment rates with these data. The final part of Table  1  shows that 51.5% of the reads align in strict mode, which requires a perfect match, while just 7% of the reads can be aligned when allowing for one mismatch. Even with the liberal default settings, allowing nine mismatches,525% (197 933 reads) can be aligned. However, after trimming, almost 78% of the reads align perfectly.\n\nDe novo assembly\nBoth datasets also showed considerable improvement in a de novo assembly scenario.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In a user-friendly format with one single function call, our package downloads and fully processes the desired TCGA data to be seamlessly integrated into a computational analysis pipeline. No further technical or biological knowledge is needed to utilize our software, thus making TCGA data easily accessible to data scientists without specific domain knowledge.\nAvailability and implementation: TCGA2STAT is available from the https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TCGA2STAT/index.html \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDetails of all wrangling and preprocessing steps are described in the package vignette (Supplementary Data).\n\nFunctions and examples\nThe TCGA2STAT package includes one major function and three additional utility functions: \u2022 getTCGA. This is the main function of the package which obtains data from Firehose and processes the data into a matrix that can be used directly for statistical analysis in R. Only two inputs are required: the cancer type desired and the data platform or molecular profiling type desired. Our package supports over thirty different cancer types and eleven different data platforms. For example, getTCGA(disease\u00bc\"OV\", data.type\u00bc \"RNASeq2\") will obtain the RNASeq2 level III RSEM data from TCGA ovarian cancer patients. With the same function, the user can specify the specific types of data for each platform, such as counts instead of RPKM for RNASeq data. Also, users can choose to download the molecular profiles along with clinical data or filter the data by particular clinical covariates. \u2022 SampleSplit. This function can be used to split the data imported via getTCGA into groups of samples profiled from the primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or normal/control groups.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe package imports both molecular profiles and clinical data of more than thirty cancer types profiled with more than eleven high-throughput genomics platforms, including microarray, sequencing, methylation array, SNP array and array-CGH (See a full list in vignette). The imported molecular profiles and clinical data are automatically combined into a matrix for easy supervised analysis. Further, we provide functions for linking and merging samples from different molecular platforms that are necessary for integrated analysis. Most importantly, our package has one simple interface to perform all of these functions. The ease of obtaining this big biological data will encourage computational scientist to mine the TCGA data which in turn will bring new insights and breakthroughs in cancer research.\n\nImplementation\nThe TCGA2STAT package is developed under the R statistical computing environment and is compatible with version 3.0 or later. The package uses HTTP calls to the Firehose site and parses necessary information to download the data. This is achieved via functions implemented through the XML package  (Lang, 2013) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOthers have provided software to obtain the TCGA data. cBio, for example, provides an R and Matlab package but was not designed to be used for genome-scale data analysis. It requires input of a list of genes from users and thus limits the exploratory use of the data. Another R package, RTCGAToolbox downloads TCGA data from Firehose  (Samur, 2014) , but the downloaded data is not preprocessed into data formats conducive for multivariate statistical analysis. Further, linking and merging functions necessary for integrated statistical analyses such as sample matching across multiple platforms and merging clinical and molecular data are not available in this package. Because of these problems, use of the TCGA data can be limited to those with domain expertise, rendering the data inaccessible for general data scientists. In response, we have developed an R package TCGA2STAT that makes the TCGA data in the open access data tier easily accessible to all by downloading, wrangling and pre-processing the data into a data matrix or list of matrices ready for multivariate or integrated statistical analyses.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Neural electrodes that are close-packed, such as in tetrodes, enable spatial oversampling of neural activity, which facilitates data analysis. Here we present the design and implementation of close-packed silicon microelectrodes, to enable spatially oversampled recording of neural activity in a scalable fashion.\nMethods\nOur probes are fabricated in a hybrid lithography process, resulting in a dense array of recording sites connected to submicron dimension wiring.\nResults\nWe demonstrate an implementation of a probe comprising 1000 electrode pads, each 9 \u00d7 9 \u03bcm, at a pitch of 11 \u03bcm. We introduce design automation and packaging methods that allow us to readily create a large variety of different designs.\nSignificance\nFinally, we perform neural recordings with such probes in the live mammalian brain that illustrate the spatial oversampling potential of closely packed electrode sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor example, the data suggests that even a 3 \u03bcm \u00d7 3 \u03bcm site has electrical characteristics com- patible with recording single unit activity, with impedances of 2 M\u03a9 and a noise level of 8 \u03bcV rms .\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe have introduced a platform to fabricate close-packed microelectrodes for neural recordings, and described the design, fabrication, and packaging methods that allow us to create a large range of scalable probe designs with close-packed recording sites. Although multisite silicon probes have been generated before, as noted in the introduction, the hybrid fabrication method here enables us uniquely to pursue electrode spacings far denser than in earlier implantable probes, thus enabling the feature of spatial oversampling of the neurons. The in vivo experiment and quantitative electrode site impedance and noise characterization demonstrated that by closely packing recording sites, we are able to spatially oversample and pick up unit activity on several recording sites at a time, and that the size of the recording sites can be reduced even lower than 9 \u03bcm. Our results suggest that close-packed electrodes may become not only instrumental for neuroscience, but also for understanding the basic principles of electrode design when scaling to large channel counts is required.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn vivo experiments were done in accordance with MIT Committee on Animal Care approved protocols. An example of data collected with a single-shank probe bearing 64 pads is shown in Fig.  12 . The data illustrate the ability of close-packed recording sites to spatially oversample neural activity, and it shows how activity from the same neuron is picked up by several neighboring sites in its vicinity. The devices we fabricated have a standard recording site of 9 \u00d7 9 \u03bcm. We wanted to understand how the dimensions of a recording site impact its electrical properties. For this, we characterized the electrode impedance and the electrical noise as a function of recording site size. The data were collected from single-shank 64-channel probes with electrode site dimensions ranging from 2.4 to 9.6 \u03bcm. We gold electroplated each recording site with a constant current density protocol (60 pulses of 1 s at 0.1975 nA/\u03bcm 2 ). Fig.  13  shows the magnitude of the recording site impedance, measured at 1 kHz in 0.9% saline. As the electrode dimensions increase, the impedance decreases.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nfrom a dense array \n[12] -  [15] . In this paper, we demonstrate a close-packed silicon microelectrode technology that enables a tight continuum of recording sites along the length of the shank (Fig.  1 ), rather than discrete arrangements of tetrode-style pads or widely spaced sites. This arrangement, thus, enables tetrodelike spatial oversampling continuously running down the shank, so that sorting of spikes recorded by such densely packed electrodes can be facilitated for all the sites of the probe simultaneously. We use advanced lithography tools to create these close-packed arrangements in a scalable fashion, demonstrating probes with 1000 electrode pads situated on five shanks with 200 recording sites per shank. A key challenge with the traditional silicon electrode designs has been that wiring to the recording sites occupied a large fraction of the available shank width. This is problematic because scaling up the number of recording sites forces the shank geometry to widen, placing an upper bound on the number of sites practical for a single shank of a given width.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Structural studies have shed light on this and other chromatin modifying machines, but much less is known about how they assemble and whether stable and functional sub-modules exist that retain enzymatic activity. Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular the chromatin remodeler CHD4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via preformed and active sub-modules. These retain enzymatic activity and are present in both the nucleus and the cytosol, an outcome with important implications for understanding NuRD function. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe more rapidly moving CHD4 molecules (which we expect are diffusing along chromatin) provide direct evidence that the MBD component plays an important role in the association of CHD4 with NuRD, consistent with our hypothesis that the CS and PMMR sub-modules interact via a Simjang/MBD-like interaction (see Fig.  5b ). In this model, CG18292 (or DOC1 in mammalian cells) might either interact with PMMR by itself or as part of the CS complex. In summary, our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of the complete and functional NuRD complex via preformed and active sub-modules. The fact that the sub-modules retain similar enzymatic activities and are present in different cellular compartments when expressed at endogenous levels is consistent with the idea that they may have independent activities in both the nucleus and the cytosol.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nProduction and purification of NuRD complexes Endogenous NuRD complex was purified from Drosophila S2 Schneider cells using stable cell lines and a metallothionein-induceable promoter (Thermo Fischer Scientific) as described in Supplementary Data.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn mammalian cells, the NuRD complex is known to comprise helicase-containing nucleosome remodeling ATPases (CHD3/4/5), histone deacetylases (HDAC1/ 2), histone chaperones (RbAp46/48), methyl-cytosine DNA-binding domain proteins (MBD2/3), metastasis tumor antigens (MTA1/2/3), and the GATA-type zinc finger proteins (GATAD2a/b) (for recent reviews, see refs.  [12, 13] ). [In Drosophila, the corresponding proteins are as follows: Mi-2 (CHD4), Rpd3 (HDAC1/2), p55 (RbAp46/48), MBD-like, MTA-like, and Simjang (GATAD2a/b). Note -we use CHD4 instead of Mi-2 throughout this paper.] It is therefore clear that considerable component variability exists within the mammalian NuRD complex suggesting that different versions of the complex might have distinct activities and biological functions in different cell types  [14] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(d) MALDI-TOF analysis after an overnight deacetylation reaction of tetra-acetylated histone H4 (1-21) peptide by the dNuRD complex.

We sought evidence for the hypothesis that a Simjang/MBD-like (or GATA2Da/b-MBD2/3) interaction is important for the association of the core PMMR deacetylase and CS chromatin-remodeling sub-modules, by carrying out single molecule tracking studies of CHD4 in the presence and absence of MBD3 in mESCs. The slowly moving molecules are not affected by the presence or absence of MBD3, and given the higher concentrations of CHD4 in the cell, and its known NuRD-independent functions, we suspect that they may correspond to CHD4 that is not associated with NuRD  [38] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNestedness in empirical matrices\nIn a third approach we evaluated the relationship between the four metrics using the empirical dataset compiled by  Atmar and Patterson (1995) . Only matrices with at least three columns and rows were used (n 0287 matrices). We performed the Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the degree of nestedness calculated by NT, Nd1 and NODF. C was not included in this analysis because it is standardized through a null model and, consequently, can produce negative values. As NODF can be used to quantify nestedness only among columns and only among rows, we also evaluated: (1) whether more endemic species occupied a subset of the sites where more widespread species were found, and (2) whether species-poor sites had proper subsets of the species found in more species rich ones. This second metacommunity feature is what most nestedness metrics aim to quantify. However, T measures whether 1's are located at the upper-left side of a matrix, and it cannot distinguish the two above cited metacommunity features.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNODF has some important features that distinguish it from the precedents metrics. One of its most important features is that it calculates nestedness independently among rows and among columns, which allows evaluating nestedness only among sites (i.e. species composition) or only among species (i.e. species occupancy). Another important feature is its versatility to evaluate how nested is one or more columns (or rows) in relation to other ones. This can be easily accomplished including only the columns or rows of interest. For instance, to evaluate whether columns c2 to c5 have proper subsets of the elements present in column c1 in the Fig.  2 , we only need to calculate the mean paired nested between c1 and the other columns (NODF 053). The procedure to evaluate whether a given column is nested within a set of columns located at its left side is virtually the same. The column c1 in the Fig.  2  has NODF 085 in relation to the four columns located at its right side. These properties of our new metric can be used to examine individual contributions of each column (or row) to the general nested pattern.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNestedness in empirical metacommunities\nOur analysis of empirical matrices compiled by  Atmar and Patterson (1995)  showed that the degree of nestedness obtained by NT, NC and Nd1 are significantly higher than those calculated through NODF. A simple possible explanation for these differences is that a perfect nested matrix according to NODF needs to have 50% of 1's whereas the other metrics adjust their maximum values for the observed fill. However, this seems not be the case. These differences were also verified when we measured NODF exclusively for columns or for rows. Given that perfect nestedness only for columns or for rows do not need to have matrix fill close to 50%, the above mentioned analytical explanation does not prevail. In fact, a probable reason for these differences is the high number of columns and rows with identical marginal totals in the empirical matrices. These pairs of columns and of rows with identical marginal totals have no degree of nestedness according to NODF, but they can be perfectly nested according to the other metrics. We also showed that the degree of nestedness for species composition is higher than that for species occupancy. We Table  3 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, single-cell differences have been largely neglected in the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation. Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function--such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells--are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1b, c ). A number of parameters can be deduced from these data and the correlation of these to genetic variants tested. Considering gene expression phenotypes in terms of single-cell distributions provides important information about gene regulation, as the noise from the regulation of transcription can be considered separately from the noise of RNA turnover (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Thus constitutively expressed genes, for example, are expected to be less noisy, demonstrating mostly the thermodynamic noise of RNA turnover in the absence of variable regulation (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Analyzing four, public, single-cell RNA sequencing data sets  6, 7  , we found that this is indeed the case (Supplementary Notes, section 1). A gene that is not constitutively expressed can be described in terms of how often it switches 'on' (burst frequency), the amount of RNA produced when 'on' (burst size) and the rate at which its RNA is degraded. A recent study 11 of 8,000 human loci found that almost all of them exhibited such 'bursty' expression, with certain loci modulating burst frequency and others modulating burst size.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe used this as a marker of cell line growth, which is a known confounder  15, 16  and was hence adjusted for in the SNP associations. Growth was noted to be sample specific, batch specific, and correlated with the expression and noise of several genes (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Counts of active Epstein-Barr virus replication-the agent used to immortalize the cells-were assessed but did not correlate with growth. In addition to considering expression distributions and cell cycle subpopulations, single-cell gene expression can be used to generate an expression network per sample. This is in contrast to most systems biology approaches in human genetic epidemiology that describe a network of all samples combined, rather than the more explicit comparison of network parameters between samples. Gene expression noise can thus be treated as a third form of perturbation, together with genetic and chemical perturbation. Figure  2b  plots an example of cell-to-cell gene correlations in ~200 cells from one of the lymphoblastoid cell lines, for genes detected in at least 50% of the cells. This network provides an example of expression behavior detected only at the single-cell resolution: the correlated and anti-correlated expression between cells.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese models and their rationales are further detailed in the Online Methods and Supplementary Notes, section 2. Gene expression distributions can also be described in terms of heterogeneous cell subpopulations. We considered cells in different stages of the cell cycle, and their varying proportions between samples. Using flow cytometry, we excluded cells with increased DNA content, as would be expected in the S and G 2 cell cycle phases. We further subdivided cells into G 1 and early S-phase based on their expression of GTSE1, a cell division molecular switch that becomes highly expressed in the S and G 2 phases  14  . Almost two-thirds of the genes demonstrated altered expression between G 1 and early S-phase (PPP2R1A is shown in Fig.  1b ), raising the question of how many associations are driven by differences in cell cycle subpopulation proportions between samples. Per cell culture, the proportion of cells without increased DNA content was found to be significantly anti-correlated with cell density after 48 h of growth (Spearman's \u03c1, -log 10 P = 5.00).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Crystals from pumices can be divided into two populations based on textural and chemical signatures: those that are inferred to have grown within the final erupted magma body (82% of plagioclase, 88% of orthopyroxene, 17% of amphibole), and those that originated in a chemically heterogeneous mush zone (18% of plagioclase, 12% of orthopyroxene, 83% of amphibole). Crystal-rich microcrystalline clasts, and clots within pumices, provide direct samples of parts of this heterogeneous source region. Amphibole model temperatures and pressures, coupled with in-situ trace element concentrations suggest that the mush region extended to ~ 15 km depth, near the base of the quartzofeldspathic crust and was rich in amphibole. Amphibole plus subordinate plagioclase and orthopyroxene, as well as antecrystic zircon were extracted from the crystal mush and ascended to a final storage region. Model temperatures and pressures from amphibole rims and Fe\u2013Ti oxide model temperatures imply that the final erupted magma body was stored between 770 and 840 \u00b0C at 4\u20136 km depths. Homogenisation of the magma body occurred through convective stirring accompanying gradually rising temperatures induced by less-evolved magma(s) emplaced at deeper levels. Plagioclase records a steady core-to-rim increase in An content, implying that a gradual heating and/or increase in H2O in the final erupted magma body occurred over some significant period prior to the eruption. No signals of a rapid defrosting or rejuvenation event that could be considered as an eruption trigger are recorded by the crystal phases. The Ongatiti ignimbrite has features both common to, and distinct from crystal rich \u2018monotonous intermediates\u2019 and crystal-poor compositionally zoned rhyolites. As such, the Ongatiti ignimbrite demonstrates that \u2018monotonous rhyolites\u2019 can also be developed on a large scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n11b  and S5 ). These conditions correspond to model depths of amphibole core crystallisation between ~4 to 15 km and final pre-eruptive depths (crystallisation of rims) at shallower crustal levels between ~4 to 6 km (Fig.  11b ). The range in modelled pre-eruptive conditions, and the contrast in modelled pressures and temperatures between rims and cores correspond well with independently determined in-situ trace element concentrations. The lower depth of pre-eruptive conditions (~6 km) is marked by a significant change in amphibole chemistry at Al T values of ~0.4 and Eu/Eu* of ~0.3 (dashed line in Fig.  8 ). The maximum estimated depth of ~15 km is consistent with the estimated depth (~16 km) of the base of the quartzo-feldspathic crust beneath much of the central TVZ (e.g.,  Harrison and White, 2006) . The exact depth of the crust beneath Mangakino (to the north west of modelled seismic arrays) is, however, not well constrained.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAmphibole cores from individual MCs record similar model temperature (780-950 \u00b0C) and pressure ranges (110-410 MPa) to their counterparts from pumices (Figs.  11c  and S5 ). Amphibole rims cover a larger range in model temperatures (790-910 \u00b0C) and pressures (120-320 MPa) than rims in normal pumice (Figs.  11c  and S5 ). Amphiboles from these MCs show evidence for temperature exchange (edenite and Ti-tschermak) and, but to a lesser extent pressure (Al-tschermak) sensitive atomic substitution mechanisms (Fig.  S6 ). Amphiboles from the large MC clast (P2190) show less evidence for temperature (edenite  and Ti-tschermak) and pressure (Al-tschermak) sensitive atomic substitution mechanisms (Fig.  S6 ). Also, many amphibole grains from sample P2190 display disequilibrium textures and therefore the reliability of any thermobarometry estimates are compromised in this case.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe validity of model amphibole temperatures and pressures was assessed using cation abundances calculated following the method of  Leake et al. (2004) . Evidence for both temperature (edenite and Ti-Tschermak) and pressure (Al-tschermak) sensitive atomic substitution mechanisms are found across the whole amphibole dataset (cf.  Bachmann and Dungan, 2002; De Angelis et al., 2013)  (Fig.  S6 ). Amphibole rims show little or no correlations between cation abundances due to the consistency of amphibole rim concentrations (i.e. no significant variations in model temperature and pressure estimates). Average pre-eruptive temperature estimates from amphibole rims are within uncertainty of the model temperatures estimated from Fe-Ti oxides (Fig.  11 ). Higher temperature (870-970 \u00b0C) crystals with dark and/or patchy cores yield higher estimations of melt H 2 O (~6 wt.%) compared to ~5 wt.% in lower temperature cores and rims.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The exact reaction process by which they originate is still debated and their hybrid nature is controversial. We show that textural and chemical inheritances of the pre-existing mantle are preserved in olivine-rich troctolites recently sampled at the Central Indian Ridge. The occurrence of a large orthopyroxene of a probable mantle origin suggests that these rocks formed through the reactive overprint of a mantle peridotite. Combining our data with those of olivine-rich troctolites worldwide, we show that the clinopyroxenes from these rocks follow chemical trends slightly distinct to those of the oceanic gabbros. These chemical trends can be ascribed to crystallization from melts assimilating mantle peridotites, suggesting that a \u201cmantle flavor\u201d can be locally retained in these hybrid rocks. The present distribution of Ol-rich troctolites suggests that melt-mantle reaction processes by which these rocks originate is likely to be more diffuse at slower spreading environments, where extensive melt-rock reactions within a thick thermal boundary layer enhances the conversion of the shallow oceanic mantle into hybrid crustal rocks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis is in agreement with the evidence that the extreme Zr/Nd fractionations are documented exclusively in the rim/interstitial/filmlike Cpx grains, which likely crystallized at the final stages of the interaction process  (Drouin et al., 2009) . Given the number of variables arbitrarily fixed in this calculation (e.g. compositions of the initial melt and of the assimilated phases), we cannot demonstrate that this AFC process is the only contributor to the incompatible element budget of the Cpx from the Ol-rich troctolites. However, our calculation supports the idea that the different Zr, Nd and Yb variations of the Cpx in Ol-rich troctolites and those in gabbros may be related to different melt-rock reaction scenarios, respectively in mantle and lower crustal environments. In agreement with the occurrence of a relict mantle Opx, the chemistry of the Cpx from Ol-rich troctolites worldwide suggest that these rocks most likely formed by melts buffered by the dissolution of a preexisting Opx-bearing mantle peridotite. The melt-rock reaction scenario we propose in this study confirms observations on highly reacted harzburgites (i.e.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n;  Coogan et al., 2000; Drouin et al., 2009; Lissenberg and Dick, 2008; Renna and Tribuzio, 2011; Suhr et al., 2008) , but likely derived from melts constantly buffered by (or mixed with) melts residual from interactions with a Cr-rich ultramafic matrix  (Arai et al., 1997; Dick and Natland, 1996) . This hypothesis is supported by experimental studies (e.g.  Saper and Liang, 2014) , which showed that the magmatic Cpx with Cr contents up to 12000 ppm and relatively high incompatible element compositions (i.e., TiO 2 ) may crystallize by melt interacting with mantle peridotites.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nRecent bulk estimates of the fast-spreading oceanic crust at Hess Deep indicate that the oceanic crust composition approximates those of experimentally derived primitive MORB  (Gillis et al., 2014) . In contrast, the bulk composition of Hole U1309D at Atlantis Massif (Atlantic) furnishes values coherent with primitive MORB only if the contribution of Ol-rich troctolites is excluded from the bulk estimates  (Godard et al., 2009) . Hence, deciphering the hybrid nature of Ol-rich troctolites is important to define to what extent hybridized mantle material can be a contributor to the lower crust, calling into question the assumptions that the oceanic crust reflects the composition of the melt extracted from the mantle. This study shows that textural and chemical inheritances of the preexisting mantle are preserved in the Ol-rich troctolites recently sampled at the intermediate-spreading Central Indian Ridge (CIR).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Linear-response harmonic calculations show a dynamically stable phonon spectrum with marked Kohn anomalies. Even if the electron-electron interaction has a minor role in the electronic bands, the inclusion of electronic exchange and correlation in the density response is essential to obtain a dynamically stable structure. Anharmonic effects, which are calculated within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, harden high-energy optical modes and soften transverse acoustic modes up to a 20% in energy. Despite a large impact of anharmonicity has been predicted in several high-pressure hydrides, here the superconducting critical temperature is barely affected by anharmonicity, as it is lowered from its harmonic 318 K value only to 300 K at 500 GPa. We attribute the small impact of anharmonicity on superconductivity to the absence of softened optical modes and the fairly uniform distribution of the electron-phonon coupling among the vibrational modes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n34.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Electronic structure Hydrogen, containing a single proton and an electron, is supposed to leave its common molecular nature under a sufficient high pressure to form a metal similar to the alkalies. In the high pressure limit the dominant electronic kinetic energy would be responsible for ending up with a free-electron-like metal. However, in the analyzed pressure range we are still close to the dissociation/metalization pressure  23  and the problem is not as simple as one could imagine a priori. Fig.  2a  shows the electronic band structure of I4 1 /amd hydrogen at 500 GPa. The bands present a huge dispersion, associated to the dominating kinetic term in the energies of the electronic states. The calculated band structure is not far from the free-electron approximation, the main difference being the band gaps opened at the border of the BZ and whenever band crossing occurs due to the interaction of the electrons with the proton lattice.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt is interesting to point out that if we consider the independent electron approximation, just keeping the V e,p term that gives the electron-proton interaction in the V scf selfconsistent potential and neglecting the V H Hartree and V xc electron-electron interactions (see Appendix for details), the resulting bands match almost perfectly with the DFT ones. Therefore, we can conclude that main differences with the free-electron approximation are due to the large proton-electron interaction, and that the interaction between the electrons is not giving any significant contribution to the band structure. Fig.  2b  shows the Fermi surface, which is quite spherical. However, the sphere shows some open areas around the high symmetry point N, where it touches the BZ boundary and a band gap is opened.\n\nB. Vibrational properties\nIn Fig.  3  we show the calculated phonon dispersion in tetragonal I4 1 /amd hydrogen at 500 GPa within DFPT. We also show the phonons at 400 and 600 GPa, but due to the minor qualitative changes we will focus just in the 500 GPa spectrum, as the analysis should be valid for all the pressure range.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhile in Ref. 8 vibrational and superconducting properties of this possible first structure of atomic hydrogen phase are analyzed holding to the harmonic approach, our goal is to elucidate the impact of anharmonicity in those properties plus its implications in lattice stability. Our results show a close to free-electron-like behavior, as the DFT band structure is perfectly described even if electron-electron interaction is fully neglected. The harmonic phonons calculated within linear-response density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT)  38  show the system is dynamically stable even if marked Kohn anomalies are present. Despite the minor role of electron-electron interaction in the electronic states, electronic exchange becomes of vital importance to ensure the dynamical stability of the system. We have included anharmonic effects using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA)  34, 35  and observed the phonon spectrum is significantly modified. However, in contrast to many superconducting hydrides  32, [34] [35] [36] [37]  , the superconducting T c obtained within the harmonic approximation is barely modified by anharmonicity, as it is only suppressed by a 6%.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, typical examples are chemically unstable and lack intrasheet \u03c0-conjugation, thereby significantly limiting their applications. Here we report a chemically stable, electronically conjugated organic framework with topologically designed wire frameworks and open nanochannels, in which the \u03c0 conjugation-spans the two-dimensional sheets. Our framework permits inborn periodic ordering of conjugated chains in all three dimensions and exhibits a striking combination of properties: chemical stability, extended \u03c0-delocalization, ability to host guest molecules and hole mobility. We show that the \u03c0-conjugated organic framework is useful for high on-off ratio photoswitches and photovoltaic cells. Therefore, this strategy may constitute a step towards realizing ordered semiconducting porous materials for innovations based on two-dimensionally extended \u03c0 systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition to traditional boronate  [7] [8] [9] 11, [13] [14] [15] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, [25] [26] [27]  and boroxine  7, 10  linkages, hydrazone  12  , imine  16, 22  and squaraine  24  linkages have been developed for the solvothermal synthesis of COFs.

Exploration of new linkage and new reaction for the synthesis of COFs is a key to achieve the further advancement of functional porous materials.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBy virtue of their three-dimensional orderings at the atomic scale, 2D COFs have shown a great potential to perform core functions in organic electronics such as light emission  9, 10  , charge transfer and separation  23, 27  , and semiconduction  9, 10, 17, [19] [20] [21] 23, 26, 28, 29  . However, typical COFs lack intrasheet p-conjugation and chemical stability, which significantly limit their practical utility. To address this shortcoming, a chemically stable yet fully pconjugated COF is highly desirable. Such a framework with threedimensionally ordered chain alignment may provide a solution for the long-standing daunting challenges in semiconducting polymer technology  [36] [37] [38]  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe show that this fully p-conjugated COF is useful for high on-off ratio photoswitches and photovoltaic cells.

The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt should be noted that in the absence of the metal-ion templates, the organic [2]catenand would adapt multiple interconverted dissymmetric and asymmetric conformations through backbone reptation instead of a well-defined D 6 -helical symmetry, which average out to give the CD responses.  71  \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nResource availability Lead contact Liang Zhang, zhangliang@chem.ecnu.edu.cn.\n\nMaterials availability\nThis study did not generate new reagents.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe value is directly determined by the configuration of the asymmetric carbon centers within ligand strand 1.

Molecular modeling suggested that a five-atom chain attached to the 4-position of the pinene-bipyridine moiety, i.e., 1, should provide the suitable orientation and positioning to promote joining of the ligand strands with desired connectivity (Figure  1B ). The chain ends with an alkene so that the ligands can be fused through ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM), and the metal templates can be subsequently removed to leave a wholly organic catenand. Chiral ligand 1 was synthesized in six steps from commercially available materials (supplemental information section ''synthesis of ligand 1'').

A conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process: we call this approach reticular synthesis. This chemistry has yielded materials designed to have predetermined structures, compositions and properties. In particular, highly porous frameworks held together by strong metal-oxygen-carbon bonds and with exceptionally large surface area and capacity for gas storage have been prepared and their pore metrics systematically varied and functionalized. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, it might be considered a subclass of crystal engineering. Research in the area of MOFs and, to a lesser extent, inorganic frameworks, has recently progressed far enough to provide examples which show the feasibility of the building-block approach and the scope of reticular synthesis. Here we take selected examples to highlight the ideas involved, with emphasis on our own work on MOFs in which structural and thermal stability characterization have been combined with in-depth studies of surface area and gas sorption capacities. The subject of metal-organic frameworks has a long history, however, so we begin by giving some perspectives on the field.\n\nPerspectives and challenges\nThe Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) documents the crystal structures of more than 11,000 extended metal-organic compounds in which a metal ion or cluster has been linked by an organic moiety in which the linking functionality is a cyanide, pyridyl, phosphate or carboxylate. Of these, nearly 3,000 compounds have threedimensional (3D) structures and about double that number have 2D structures.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA lthough the synthesis of new materials has long been recognized as the most essential element in advancing technology, it generally remains more of an art than a science-in that the discovery of new compounds has mostly been serendipitous, using methods referred to by critics as 'shake and bake', 'mix and wait' and 'heat and beat'. For much of the twentieth century, this worked well for the synthesis of important solid-state materials, and we expect that it will continue to yield interesting compounds. However, it is becoming increasingly urgent to produce materials designed to perform highly specific and cooperative functions \n1, 2  . Recent extensive research into the design and synthesis of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) has led to numerous practical and conceptual developments in that direction  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  . Specifically, the chemistry of MOFs has provided an extensive class of crystalline materials with high stability, tunable metrics, organic functionality, and porosity. Here we present some of the important developments that have shaped this rapidly growing field and propose a general conceptual framework, which serves as a useful tool in designing materials constructed from molecular building blocks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTetrahedral building blocks such as HMT  32     33  have been linked by metal ions to form decorated diamond structures, while TPY  34  and ATC  35  are examples of links predesigned so that their assembly into diamond networks is done by linking through hydrogen bonding. Consideration of this range of crystal structures, in particular those of MOFs, has led us to identify two critical questions for reticular synthesis. First, of the almost unlimited possible networks, which can be expected to form and how can they be synthesized?\n\nBox 1\n\n\nDefinitions and structures\nHere we define some terms and illustrate organic species referred to in the text by abbreviations in the Box 1 figure.

We identified a mechanism of intrinsic multi-drug resistance based on the survival of a tumor cell subpopulation. Treatment with various drugs, including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (OXPHOS) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a two-tiered approach combining anti-cancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis concept is gaining prominence in the field of cancer research, with several studies reporting the enrichment of quiescent cancer stem cells after chemotherapy. For example, slow-cycling glioblastoma cells survive temozolomide treatment  (Chen et al., 2012) . Accordingly, if cell subpopulations can act as major drivers for tumor maintenance and mediate universal therapeutic resistance, approaches that target this phenotype could increase the efficacy of treatment regimens and reduce the risk of melanoma relapses. We have recently demonstrated that, even within highly proliferative melanomas, there is a slow-cycling cell subpopulation that is identifiable by the expression of the histone 3 K4 demethylase JARID1B  (Roesch et al., 2005 (Roesch et al., , 2010)) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nInterestingly, in the latter study, slow-cycling cells were characterized by the expression of the chromatin-remodeling factor JARID1A, a homolog of JARID1B. Considering JARID1B's role in continuous tumor maintenance  (Roesch et al., 2010) , we asked (1) whether the subpopulation of JARID1B high slow-cycling melanoma cells displays lower drug susceptibility compared to the bulk of tumor cells and (2) whether this resistant phenotype can be pharmacologically eradicated.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nCytotoxic Treatment of Melanoma Cells Results in the Enrichment of a Surviving JARID1B high Slow-Cycling Subpopulation\nTo assess whether slow-cycling melanoma cells show differences in the therapeutic response compared to the rapidly prolif-erating bulk, we treated melanoma cultures with various anticancer drugs. To discriminate between slowly and rapidly cycling subpopulations, we used a JARID1B-promoter-EGFPreporter construct, as previously described  (Roesch et al., 2010) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nInterestingly, we found an increase in pAKT in J/EGFP high cells that correlates well with our previous finding that reactivation of PI3K signaling can overcome vemurafenib's cytotoxicity in melanoma cells  (Villanueva et al., 2010) . The relevance of this finding with regard to therapeutic strategies comprising combinatorial inhibition of PI3K in slow-cycling cells will be the subject of future studies. Considering the heterogeneity of melanoma, we are currently delineating additional molecular mechanisms underlying resistance of the JARID1B high slow-cycling phenotype. However, non-JARID1B-related phenotypic resistance is likely to occur, and all potential resistance mechanisms could contribute to melanoma recurrence. Our data confirm that slow-cycling melanoma cells of different genetic backgrounds are intrinsically resistant to various anticancer drugs and are characterized by the presence of several key enzymes of oxidative energy metabolism. Depletion of the JARID1B high slow-cycling phenotype either by gene knockdown or by targeting of its bioenergetic metabolism sensitizes melanoma for a more pronounced and long-lasting therapeutic effect.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics, and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial genetic evidence supporting the concept that lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications can be used for prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n10c ).\n\nDiscussion\nIn concert, we have exploited natural genetic variation to test a collaborative model for enhancer selection and function, and conversely explored the ability of this model to explain strain-specific differences in transcription factor binding and epigenetic features associated with functional enhancers in macrophages. These studies provide genetic evidence that lineage-determining transcription factors are dependent on collaborative binding to variably spaced DNA recognition motifs in order to select enhancers and enable binding of signaldependent transcription factors. Notably, the variable motif distances observed at co-bound LDTF loci suggests that collaborative binding does not generally require direct proteinprotein interactions between the involved transcription factors. The proposed hierarchical LDTF collaborative model provides a conceptual framework for prioritization of non-coding disease-associated regulatory variants. While all cells express hundreds of transcription factors, a large fraction of functional enhancers (~70% in macrophages) are characterized by collaborative interactions involving relatively small sets of lineage determining transcription factors (e.g., PU.1, AP-1 and C/EBPs). The requirement for collaborative binding interactions provides an explanation for why transcription factor binding is lost at sites where mutations do not occur in the cognate recognition motif.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, by collecting a relatively limited set of genomic binding data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications, this analytical approach can be exploited to explain a greater extent of variation in enhancer selection and function than previously possible  7, 10  . To further increase the specificity and sensitivity for detecting functional variations, identification of transcription factor motifs that permit binding but diverge from the consensus PWM, i.e. \"weak\" motifs, needs to be improved, as such sites are more likely to be affected by mutation  29, 30  . In addition, transcription factors less abundant than LDTFs likely play individually small but collectively significant roles. At a larger scale, non-cisacting, long-range epigenetic mechanisms may also be important for enhancer selection. A major goal for the future will be to extend these approaches to understanding natural genetic variation associated with human disease.\n\nMethods\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2c, d , respectively.

But their ultra-short lifetime, typically 100 fs or less, and correspondingly short transport length-scale in the nanometre range constrain real-space investigations. Here we report variable temperature and voltage measurements of the nonlocal manipulation of adsorbed molecules on the Si(111)-7 \u00d7 7 surface in the scanning tunnelling microscope. The range of the nonlocal effect increases with temperature and, at constant temperature, is invariant over a wide range of electron energies. The measurements probe, in real space, the underlying hot electron dynamics on the 10 nm scale and are well described by a two-dimensional diffusive model with a single decay channel, consistent with 2-photon photo-emission (2PPE) measurements of the real time dynamics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n49) and for that found for carrier diffusion in single silicon core-shell nanowires of 35 cm 2 s \u00c0 1 (ref. 50). Figure  3b  presents the temperature dependence of the nonlocal length-scale l. As the lattice temperature increases so does the nonlocal manipulation range. This further conforms to the diffusive transport model which, unlike ballistic transport, should increase with increasing temperature. The relationship also demonstrates the connection between the temperature of the crystal lattice and the measured electron dynamics. Hot electrons undergo several scattering processes to bring them into eventual thermal equilibrium with a crystal lattice. Typically carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering brings a population of hot carriers into a Fermi-Dirac distribution with some characteristic hot electron temperature T e within 10 s of fs (refs 43,51,52). We inject at currents of B100 pA and therefore have, on average, one-electron injected every 1 ns. Given the 180 fs lifetime of the electrons within the 2.0 eV state, we rule out carrier-carrier scattering. Further carrier-phonon scattering brings the mean energy of the electron distribution down to ultimately thermalize with the lattice.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nT he dynamics of hot electrons, those with energies perhaps hundreds of times greater than the available thermal energy, is central to understanding the properties of many electronic devices. For example, they contribute to leakage currents across CMOS transistors and may fundamentally limit their downsizing \n[1] [2] [3]  and they are intrinsic to solar cells, where high energy photons generate hot electrons that consequently generate a photocurrent  [4] [5] [6]  . Hot electrons can also, for example, be induced through plasmonics  [7] [8] [9]  and offer a route to instigate non-thermal chemical reactions  10  . Hot electron charge transport is thus the subject of major scientific research, both experimentally and theoretically  [11] [12] [13] [14]  . But the experiments are constrained by the ultra-short lifetime of hot electrons, typically 100 fs or less, and hence their corresponding transport length-scale of a few nm (refs 15,16). Direct pump-probe measurements with ultra-fast lasers typically provide little or no spatial information.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn our case, this carrierphonon scattering appears to occur within the high-lying 2.0 eV state since we have a temperature dependence of the nonlocal range. Subsequent scattering, here in a time of 180 fs, removes the electron from this state to lower lying states. There is therefore a competition between electron-phonon scattering thermalizing the hot-electron within the 2.0 eV state and scattering that electron into a lower lying state. This will result in a dynamic quasi-equilibrated electron distribution within the 2.0 eV state. To gain an insight into this connection we present a simple model of the temperature dependence of the nonlocal effect in terms of a 2D random walk. The RMS of a 2D random walk can be equated to 2D diffusion by l ffiffiffiffi N p \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2Dt p ; where l is the random walk step length and N the number of steps.

They are predicted to exist in a vortex core of superconducting topological insulators. However, it is extremely difficult to distinguish them experimentally from other quasiparticle states for the tiny energy difference between Majorana fermions and these states, which is beyond the energy resolution of most available techniques. Here, we circumvent the problem by systematically investigating the spatial profile of the Majorana mode and the bound quasiparticle states within a vortex in Bi(2)Te(3) films grown on a superconductor NbSe(2). While the zero bias peak in local conductance splits right off the vortex center in conventional superconductors, it splits off at a finite distance \u223c20 nm away from the vortex center in Bi(2)Te(3). This unusual splitting behavior has never been observed before and could be possibly due to the Majorana fermion zero mode. While the Majorana mode is destroyed by the interaction between vortices, the zero bias peak splits as a conventional superconductor again. This work provides self-consistent evidences of Majorana fermions and also suggests a possible route to manipulating them. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFigure  1C  shows a typical contour of zero-bias differential conductance (ZBC) taken on a 1QL Bi 2 Te 3 film in an external magnetic field of 0.1T. An Abrikosov vortex is clearly seen, which exhibits higher ZBC values due to the suppression of superconductivity within the vortex. At the center of the vortex, a peak in dI/dV due to the bound quasi-particle states can be measured as shown in Fig.  1D  (see supplementary materials for the experimental conditions). Along the dashed line indicated in Fig.  1C , we measured the spatial variation of the dI/dV spectra as a function of distance (r) away from the vortex center. The results are given in Fig.  2A . One can see that only one peak appears at zero-bias in the dI/dV spectra near the vortex center, and the peak splits into two at a finite distance r. The splitting energy increases linearly with r. For a better view, we plot dI/dV as functions of r and sample bias V in a fake color image in Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis leads to an unusual p-wave-like paired state that is time-reversal invariant and robust against disorder  8  . Theoretical studies later showed that the MFs may also reside at two ends of a semiconductor nanowire (NW) with strong spin-orbit coupling when it is contacted to an s-wave SC in a proper external magnetic field  9  . Several transport measurements revealed a signature of MFs, i.e., a sharp zero-bias peak in differential conductance spectrum, in various NW/SC junctions  [10] [11] [12] [13]  . In InSb/Nb junction, an unconventional fractional a.c. Josephson effect was observed and attributed to the existence of MFs 14 . However, alternative explanations of these transport results based on disorder and/or band bending in the NWs have been proposed  [15] [16] [17] [18]  . As yet, no conclusive evidence has been established for the existence of MF. In contrary, the disorder alone is unlikely to induce a zero-bias peak in a TI/SC heterostructure, which can be used to detect MFs without complications mentioned above.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs the field reaches 0.18T, the zero-bias peak becomes much weaker. In a conventional s-wave SC the vortex density is proportional to the magnetic field below a critical field H c2 . A single vortex structure is not sensitive to the external field and the LDOS near a vortex core is essentially unchanged as the field increases. The bound states of a vortex in NbSe 2 do not show the abrupt change when the magnetic field increases from 0.025T to 1.25T (Fig.  3B ). The dramatic change in the zero-bias peak intensity in 5QL Bi 2 Te 3 film is interpreted as the result of the coupling between adjacent vortices. At a small field, the distance between vortices is much larger than the vortex size, so the interaction between the vortices can be neglected. As the field increases to 0.18T, the distance between two adjacent vortices is reduced to about 110nm (Fig.  3C ). Moreover, the higher magnetic field suppresses the superconducting gap and coherence length becomes longer, so the interaction between the vortices becomes strong enough to destroy the Majorana modes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Key uncertainties in kilonova modeling include the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products\u2014non-thermal beta-particles, alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays\u2014and the efficiency with which their kinetic energy is absorbed by the ejecta. The radioactive energy emitted, along with its thermalization efficiency, sets the luminosity budget and is therefore crucial for predicting kilonova light curves. We outline uncertainties in the radioactivity, describe the processes by which the decay products transfer energy to the ejecta, and calculate time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We determine the net thermalization efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process yields\u2014in particular, the production of \n-decaying translead nuclei\u2014and on ejecta mass, velocity, and magnetic fields. We incorporate our results into detailed radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated kilonova light curve predictions. Thermalization effects reduce kilonova luminosities by a factor of roughly 2 at peak, and by an order of magnitude at later times (15 days or more after explosion). We present analytic fits to time-dependent thermalization efficiencies, which can be used to improve light curve models. We revisit the putative kilonova that accompanied gamma-ray burst 130603B, and estimate the mass ejected in that event. We find later time kilonova light curves can be significantly impacted by alpha-decay from translead isotopes; data at these times may therefore be diagnostic of ejecta abundances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nModels with higher initial electron fractions may fail to produce these heavy elements. The opacities for such models would be much lower, and the associated light curves would be shorter, brighter, and bluer (e.g.,  Metzger et al. 2010; Barnes & Kasen 2013; Kasen et al. 2015) . Figure  17  shows that our more accurate treatment of thermalization impacts predicted photometry for all ejecta models considered. Relative to earlier calculations with less sophisticated thermalization schemes, we find kilonova light curves peak slightly earlier, have lower luminosities at peak, and have much dimmer late-time luminosities. The effects of thermalization are most pronounced for less massive and higher velocity ejecta models, which are dimmer and fade more quickly than their slower, more massive counterparts. The uncertainties complicating the calculation of f t tot ( ), outlined in earlier sections, lead to uncertainties in light curve calculations. The most important of these are illustrated in the middle panel of Figure  17 , which presents bolometric light curves for our fiducial ejecta model for all magnetic fields considered and for the DZ31 nuclear mass model.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAccounting for time-dependent thermalization efficiencies has a significant impact on kilonova luminosity, particularly for models with lower masses and higher velocities. For our fiducial model, the predicted luminosity is lower by a factor of \uf0882 at peak, and by 10 days is lower by an factor of 5. 18. Select broadband light curves for our fiducial ejecta model for two treatments of thermalization: full f t tot ( ) (left panel), and the cruder treatment employed in earlier kilonova calculations (right panel). The curves are dimmer in the newer models, reflecting the reduction in thermalized energy, but relationships between the light curves in the various bands is mostly unchanged, so the kilonova colors are preserved.

The reason for CO2 promotion is not sufficiently understood at the particle level due to the catalyst complexity and the high demands of characterization under true reaction conditions. Herein, we applied operando synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and modulated-excitation infrared spectroscopy on a commercial catalyst to gain insights into its morphology and surface chemistry. These studies unveiled that Cu and ZnO agglomerate and ZnO particles flatten under CO/H2 and/or CO2 /H2 . Under the optimal CO/CO2 /H2 mixture, sintering is prevented and ZnO crystals adopt an elongated shape due to the minimal presence of the H2 O byproduct, enhancing the water-gas shift activity and thus the methanol production. Our results provide a rationale to the CO2 promotion emphasizing the importance of advanced analytical methods to establish structure-performance relations in heterogeneous catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHowever,the relevance of the structure-function relationships derived in these works is limited by the use of model materials and/or ex situ characterization.

With respect to the hexagonal ZnO particles, aC O/H 2 atmosphere did not provoke significant alterations but growth and formation of platelet-like morphologies were observed under CO 2 /H 2 .S ince CO 2 hydrogenation was only slightly improved over smaller Cu particles and was insensitive to the morphology of ZnO,wededuced that this reaction cannot become al imiting step for the promotional effect.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[4]  Thel atter is much faster than the hydrogenation of CO but strongly limited by thermodynamics and product inhibition by H 2 Oa th igh CO 2 concentrations resulting in the typical volcano plot shown in Figure  1 (described later).

Guo et al. further underlined this potential. They claimed, based on an array of different MOFs in comparison with alumina, their industrial adsorbent of choice for dehumidification, that all MOFs have superior total capacities, and some also display superior breakthrough behavior, and thus faster kinetics.  454  In addition, cyclic regeneration for MOFs can be achieved with significantly less energy (lower T des ), all in line with preceding findings (desiccant, AHP/AC).  454   The potential of MOFs as adsorbents in adsorption-driven allocation of heat and cold has been thoroughly assessed in this Review. The adsorption mechanism of water on MOFs is known. Water initially adsorbs at specific hydrophilic sites (uncoordinated metal sites, OH-groups on inorganic clusters, or functional groups on the organic ligand). Subsequently, additional water clusters around these initially adsorbed water molecules, after which the pores are filled via volume filling (d p < D c ) or capillary condensation (d p > D c ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMOF EVALUATION AND SELECTION\nWhen regarding water as adsorptive, stability is more of an issue than for alcohols. Nonetheless, a vast amount of information on water adsorption in MOFs is available, and a lot of attention has been devoted to the development of MOFs for AHP/AC applications with water as working fluid (arguably the first being ISE-1(Ni) developed by  Henninger et al. 247  ). The interest is also reflected in a number of patent applications. Chang and co-workers were among the first to have patents granted for the application of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) in AHP/ACs.  [316] [317] [318] [319] [320]  Others have filed patents as well, although often specific structures are not targeted, but instead the aim is to cover a broad range of different possible structures.  [321] [322] [323] [324] [325]  Not surprisingly, thus there are indeed MOFs that have been shown to be (relatively) stable under cyclic water adsorption.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n380, 427  Before concluding this Review with a summary and outlook (section 8), alternative applications in which MOF adsorbents could potentially be employed are briefly discussed. All of these applications utilized water as working fluid.\n\nALTERNATIVE APPLICATIONS\nAdsorption-driven allocation of heat or cold is not the only application based on the reversible ad-and desorption of a working fluid. In this section, two major alternative applications will be discussed briefly, and the potential of applying MOFs in these will be concisely assessed. These are thermochemical energy storage (section 7.1) and open cycle dehumidification for air conditioning (section 7.2).\n\nThermochemical Energy Storage\nAs mentioned in section 1, temporary energy storage is required when energy supply and demand are out of phase. Especially thermochemical storage is interesting, as it requires significantly less volume to store the same amount of energy  18, 19  as compared to systems based on latent 20 or sensible energy.  21  Conceptually, sorption-based thermochemical storage follows the same cycle as a heat pump, with the exception that the adsorption and desorption processes are separated by storage time.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[3]  In spite of versatile advantages of porous MOFs, which include tailor-made pore structures and controllable porosity by change of organic ligands and metal subunits,  [2]  most MOFs suffer from a lack of hydrothermal stability.  [4]  Structural damage to a MOF caused by moisture at processing conditions or during regeneration will strongly limit the utilization of a MOF as a sorbent for industrial applications.  [4]  Conversely, highly porous MOFs with good hydrothermal stability represent candidates for industrially useful water sorbents.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCubic mesoporous metal(III) di-or tri-carboxylates with hierachical pore structures labeled MIL-101(Cr), MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr), and MIL-100(Al) (MIL stands for Materials of Institut Lavoisier) using trivalent octahedral metals and the simplest aromatic carboxylates such as terepthalate and trimesate have been discovered.  [5, 6]  Based on this requirement, the exceptional hydrothermal stability and large sorption uptakes known for MIL-101 and MIL-100 encouraged us to assess their applicability for water sorption applications.  [5, 6]  Despite studies done on water adsorption in MOFs,  [7]  reports dealing with MOFs as water adsorbents are still scarce  [8]  and there is a particular need to evaluate their low temperature desorption properties, i.e., below 80 \u00b0C for application to energy-efficient dehumidication systems.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis suggests that most of the water molecules are physisorbed on MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe) with a low host-guest interaction (close to the energy of liquefaction) except for the coordinated water molecules, allowing for the low-temperature desorption of water.  designed for a prototype simulation of a household desiccanttype dehumidifier than that with a zeolite rotor, which is commercially available. The detailed results will be published elsewhere. In conclusion, we have unambiguously demonstrated that hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks, MIL-100 and MIL-101 with mesoporous cages behave as advanced water adsorbents applicable to energy-efficient dehumidification. Elaborate investigations of their water sorption properties have shown huge sorption uptakes even at 40 \u00b0C as well as high desorption rates below 80 \u00b0C together with hydrothermal stability. In comparison with the water sorption behaviors of commercial adsorbents such as zeolite NaX, SAPO-34, and silica gel, the improved performance in MIL-100 and MIL-101 demonstrated here suggests commercially viable applications including energyefficient desiccant dehumidification and fresh water production.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

S7), in line with previous findings of a positive correlation between the dendritic spine density of memory engram cells and memory expression triggered by natural recall cues [citation 25].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Labelling and optical erasure of synaptic memory traces in the motor cortex \nAbstract: Dendritic spines are the major loci of synaptic plasticity and are considered as possible structural correlates of memory. Nonetheless, systematic manipulation of specific subsets of spines in the cortex has been unattainable, and thus, the link between spines and memory has been correlational. We developed a novel synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nl, n ), while re-potentiation was significantly less prominent in mice that did not perform the retraining task (home cage group) (Fig.  5i-k, l , n; Extended Data Fig.  7d, e ). Furthermore, newly potentiated spines, which were not potentiated in the first 2 days, were less abundant in the re-training and home cage groups compared with the dual task group (yellow, Fig.  5m, n ). These findings suggest that reorganisation of distinct synaptic ensembles is specific for each learning task.\n\nDiscussion\nCurrent models of learning and memory suggest that structural plasticity of spines is the underlying mechanism of information storage in the brain. Nonetheless, clear visualization of spine structure in vivo requires the sparse labelling of neurons, and analysis of structural changes in spines is considerably laborious. In contrast, the AS-PaRac1 signal appears as fluorescence puncta, which allows the detection of potentiated spines far more easily, even at high transfection condition. Moreover, the role of potentiated spines can be directly assessed with PA during behavioural examinations.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2a-e ). Consistent with previous findings  33, 34  , even in the training-free period, a substantial number of spines 'spontaneously' underwent structural potentiation (formation or enlargement of spines; see the definition in Extended Data Fig.  4a ), but the trained mice exhibited significantly more structural potentiation compared with the non-trained mice (Fig.  2d ). Notably, synaptic fluorescence of AS-PaRac1 just after training (0 day) strongly correlated with the change in spine size upon training (Fig.  2f ). It is unlikely that the accumulation of AS-PaRac1 caused the potentiation or labelled the spines primed for potentiation such as for the 'tagged synapse'  35, 36  , because the initial quantity of AS-PaRac1 before learning (-1 day) did not correlate with the change in spine size after learning (Fig.  2g ). Analysis of AS-PaRac1 puncta in the dendritic shaft suggested that the majority of AS-PaRac1 signal was located in the dendritic spines, and the labelling of shaft synapses was negligible (Extended Data Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2c , dendrite #1), while others disappeared (Fig.  2c , dendrites #2 and #3). Importantly, the structural potentiation and AS-PaRac1 labelling triggered during the 'Learning' period were more likely to be preserved than those triggered during the training-free period (Fig.  2j , 'Before' and 'After-1'). Consistently, longitudinal imaging of the structurally potentiated spines revealed that the majority of those with the retention of AS-PaRac1 for 24 h maintained structural potentiation for at least 48 h (Fig.  2k , green trace), while the structurally potentiated spines lacking AS-PaRac1 retention returned to the pre-potentiated state (Fig.  2k , black trace). Such AS-PaRac1 retention might be maintained by reverberation of learning-activated neuronal circuits, because AS-PaRac1 was only expressed in Arc-expressing neurons, in which the persistent activation helps to maintain plastic changes in the neocortex  26, 37  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Besides being easy and cheap, the catalyst synthesis is flexible enough to allow further optimization of the porosity and surface area. To date, the true dependence of the structure on the reactivity remains unclear, and further investigations are needed. However, as a comparable material synthesized at higher temperatures (1000 \u00b0C) supports the four-electron process, certain assumptions can be made: (1) Consistent with simulations of Okamoto,  22  an increased nitrogen content may favor the two-electron process. (2) The \"radical\" character of nitrogen-bound carbon, which is essential for the two-electron process,  21  may be more pronounced for meso-BMP-800 because of the lower degree of delocalization. (3) The pyrrolic nitrogen sites within the carbon material elucidated by highresolution XPS, which are not present at higher synthesis temperatures, might indeed contribute in an essential way to the activity of the two-electron process.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdditionally, the method is very inexpensive (regarding electricity 2.4 EUR cents kg H 2 O 2 -1 at 10 EUR cents kWh -1 industry price), while costs for the transport of liquid hazardous H 2 O 2 could be avoided. As such, precise attribution of the catalytic activity to a specific binding site seems rather speculative. Besides the importance of an increased nitrogen content retaining sufficient conductivity (see ref 22), another possible factor affecting the reactivity is the degree of graphitization. Here, the polarizability of the graphitic layers should influence the adsorption properties, while the elongation of the conjugated \u03c0 system could determine crucial electronic properties. As the radical character of nitrogen-bound carbon may support the two-electron process, less-conjugated \u03c0 systems should be more favored for hydrogen peroxide synthesis.  21  However, nitrogen-doped carbon materials have also received great attention as support materials for metal and metal alloy catalysts, for example, in the methanol oxidation reaction or oxygen reduction to water.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWith the synthesis of novel mesoporous metal-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in hydrogen fuel cells with activities in basic media comparable to those of commercial platinum catalysts, we and others could recently endorse the thesis of highly ORR-active nitrogen-doped carbon.  13, 14  However, our nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts also possess considerably high catalytic activity in the acidic media of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).  13  Mechanistic analysis of the electrochemical process showed that the number of transferred electrons was not always four, as theoretically expected for the complete reduction of O 2 to H 2 O; in some cases, lower, uneven values were calculated. These mixed processes indicate the presence of varying reactivity for different C-N substructures (such as pyridinic, pyrrolic, or quaternary).

NaChBac inactivation kinetics show strong, bell-shaped voltage dependence with characteristic time constants ranging from approximately 50 ms at depolarized voltages to a maximum of approximately 100 s at the inactivation midpoint. Activation and inactivation parameters for four different covalently linked tandem dimer or tandem tetramer constructs were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type channel. Point mutations in the outer part of the pore revealed an important influence of the S195 residue on the process of inactivation. For two mutants (S195D and S195E), the maximal and minimal rates of inactivation observed were increased by approximately 2.5-fold, and the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, compared to the wild-type channel. Our data suggest that pore vestibule structure is an important determinant of NaChBac inactivation, whereas the inactivation mechanism is independent of the number of free cytoplasmic N- and C-termini in the functional channel. In these respects, NaChBac inactivation resembles C-type or slow inactivation modes observed in other voltage-gated K and Na channels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nINTRODUCTION\nOne of the common properties of voltage-gated channels is their ability to inactivate in response to membrane depolarization. Two general mechanisms of inactivation have been characterized. The first mechanism is usually typified by relatively fast inactivation during a sustained depolarization, effected at the molecular level by a ''ball and chain''  (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)  or ''hinged-lid'' mechanism  (6) . Molecular mechanisms of this type of inactivation, called N-type inactivation, have been studied in detail in K and Na channels. The groups responsible for this type of inactivation are localized at the cytoplasmic side of the channel. For example, in Shaker K-channel, the N-terminal region of the channel plays the role of the ''ball'', which occludes the inner part of the pore after channel activation and thus closes the channel  (7) . A similar mechanism has been described for Na channels. In this case channel block is probably provided by the III-IV interdomain linker latched by a triplet of hydrophobic residues (IFM motif) to form a hinged lid  (8) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA second type of inactivation process, usually with significantly slower kinetics, has been observed in a number of channels  (9) (10) (11) . This type of inactivation is called C-type or slow inactivation, with yet a third inactivation process (P-type) also recognized in potassium channels  (12) . Although the detailed mechanisms of slow inactivation processes are incompletely understood, it is believed that rearrangement of the pore, rather than motion of a cytoplasmic region of the channel, is likely to play a central role  (13) (14) (15) . The importance of better understanding of slow inactivation in sodium voltage-gated channels is evident since its alteration is linked to such clinical disorders as periodic paralysis, myotonia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and long-QT syndrome, as recently reviewed by  Vilin and  Ruben  (16) . The prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel (NaCh-Bac) shows homology with eukaryotic voltage-gated channels though its sequence shows closer similarity with calcium channels than with sodium channels  (17) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUsing tandem-linked dimers and tetramers, we did not detect any significant difference between inactivation of wild-type channel and the tandem concatemers. Hence, we conclude that, in contrast to N-type inactivation in eukaryotic channels, NaChBac inactivation does not involve either N-or C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of the WT monomer. Slow inactivation in sodium channels may involve a mechanism similar to that of C-type inactivation in potassium channels  (42) . C-type inactivation usually has slower kinetics than N-type and is sensitive to the mutations in the pore region.

ZnO nanorods were grown on the ZnO seed layer from solution, and their diameters and lengths were controlled by precursor concentration and growth time. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite infiltrated ZnO nanorods showed a power conversion efficiency of 11.13% with short-circuit current density Jsc of 20.08 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage Voc of 991 mV and fill factor of 0.56. Square spectral feature of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was observed, where EQE exceeded 80% in almost the entire wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, and the integrated current density of 20.03 mA/cm2 calculated from EQE data was in good agreement with the observed Jsc. Compared to the perfect spectral response of ZnO nanorods, a perovskite solar cell based on TiO2 nanorods exhibited an integrated current density (16 mA/cm2) much lower than the measured Jsc (20.9 mA/cm2). In addition, time-limited photocurrent response under 530 and 700 nm monochromatic beams at 10 Hz showed that device signal amplitude, associated with charge collection, was rapidly saturated for the ZnO nanorod-based device whereas charge collection was not fully detected for the TiO2 nanorod-based device because of slow collection rate. The current results suggest that ZnO nanorod is an effective charge collection system in CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor the case of the electron-injecting oxide system, except for the TiO 2 nanoparticles, one-dimensional TiO 2  [9] [10] [11]  and ZnO 12,13 were investigated. Although electron transport in ZnO was observed to be faster than that in TiO 2 ,  13  photovoltaic performances of ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells were inferior to those of TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cells. This might be due to nonoptimized ZnO nanorods. Here, we report high-efficiency ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells. Diameter and length of the solution-grown ZnO nanorods are controlled by varying the solution concentration and immersion time. PCE of 11.13% is achieved using 1 \u03bcm long ZnO nanorods (diameter of about 80 nm) in the absence of a compact TiO 2 blocking layer. The photovoltaic performance, especially external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectral response is compared between ZnO nanorods and TiO 2 nanorods.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n3  It was also confirmed that the perovskite solar cell could work well even without a mesoporous TiO 2 film, where a thin, continuous CH 3 NH 3 PbI 2 Cl layer formed on the Al 2 O 3 surface showed a PCE of 10.9%.  4  Recent progress pushed PCE of perovskite solar cell up to 15%.  5, 6  Thanks to the high open-circuit voltage V oc of perovskite solar cell exceeding 1 V, a PCE of 20% is predicted from perovskite solar cell,  7, 8  which indicates that organometal halide perovskite is a very promising solar cell material. There are two branches in developing perovskite solar cell; one is based on electron-injecting nanostructured oxide layer, and the other is based on nonelectron-injecting scaffold layer (meso-superstructure) or pn junction type planar structure.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nLength of the solution-grown TiO 2 nanorods is about 1 \u03bcm, and their width is 80-90 nm, as can be seen in Figure  9e . TiO 2 compact layer is clearly seen between TiO 2 nanorods and FTO. A thin spiro-MeOTAD HTM layer is formed over the TiO 2 nanorod film (Figure  9f ). Two-step spin coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in the 1 \u03bcm long TiO 2 nanorod film results in J sc of 20.92 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 869 mV, FF of 0.55, and PCE of 10.02%, which is higher than the previous result for the similar TiO 2 length 9 because of the different coating procedure for the perovskite as mentioned previously. Compared to the ZnO  nanorod, the slightly lower PCE is due to lower V oc , associated with lower conduction band position for the rutile TiO 2 structure and/or enhanced recombination.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We report that single iron sites embedded in a silica matrix enable direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane, exclusively to ethylene and aromatics. The reaction is initiated by catalytic generation of methyl radicals, followed by a series of gas-phase reactions. The absence of adjacent iron sites prevents catalytic C-C coupling, further oligomerization, and hence, coke deposition. At 1363 kelvin, methane conversion reached a maximum at 48.1% and ethylene selectivity peaked at 48.4%, whereas the total hydrocarbon selectivity exceeded 99%, representing an atom-economical transformation process of methane. The lattice-confined single iron sites delivered stable performance, with no deactivation observed during a 60-hour test. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nT he challenge of converting natural gas into transportable fuels and chemicals (1) has been spurred by several emerging industrial trends, including rapidly rising demand for H 2 (for upgrading lower-quality oils) and a global shortage of aromatics caused by shifting refinery targets toward gasoline. Light olefins, which are key chemical feedstocks, are currently made from methanol, which itself is made through multistage catalytic transformations via syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) \n(2, 3) , although there is also ongoing research to convert syngas directly to light olefins  (4, 5) . However, in all such approaches, either CO or H 2 is needed to remove oxygen from CO, resulting in a carbon-atom utilization efficiency below 50%. Despite their low efficiency, high capital and production costs, and enormous CO 2 emissions, syngas routes dominate current and near-term industrial practices for natural gas conversion (6, 7).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDirect conversion of CH 4 is potentially more economical and environmentally friendly but is challenging because CH 4 exhibits high C-H bond strength (434 kJ/mol), negligible electron affinity, large ionization energy, and low polarizability  (8) . In the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin in the early 1980s, CH 4 was activated with the assistance of oxygen  (9) . This finding initiated a worldwide research surge to explore the high-temperature (>1073 K) oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C 2 hydrocarbons  (10, 11) . Hundreds of catalytic materials have since been synthesized and tested, principally during the 1990s, as well as in recent years. Unfortunately, the presence of O 2 leads irreversibly to overoxidation, resulting in a large amount of the thermodynamically stable endproducts CO 2 and H 2 O. Thus, the carbon utilization efficiency of OCM remains relatively low  (12, 13) . Slow progress in discovering new catalysts to circumvent this problem has hindered further development, and no economically viable process has been put into practice so far.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy comparison, the catalytically initiated reaction described here compares very favorably with other reported direct-conversion processes, including pyrolysis, OCM  (13) , and nonoxidative aromatization  (21) . Finally, because natural gas usually contains some ethane, we added 1 and 5 vol % ethane to the reactant stream. The presence of ethane substantially enhanced methane conversion (fig.  S2 ) (  22 ), and ethane is almost completely converted, although a small amount of coke is formed at 1173 K and a space velocity of 4.84 liter gcat -1 h -1 . The unprecedented efficiency of the catalytically initiated CH 4 conversion process is attributed to the high activity of the coordinatively unsaturated iron sites toward the C-H bond of CH 4  (28, 29) . The isolated nature of these sites, as evidenced by sub-angstrom-resolution high-angle annular-dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), precludes surface C-C coupling and, hence, coke formation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread pathogen responsible for generally asymptomatic and persistent infections in healthy people. Recent evidence indicates that HCMV gene products are expressed in over 90% of malignant type glioblastomas (GBM). In addition, the HCMV Immediate Early-1 protein (IE1) is expressed in >90% of tumors analyzed.\nMethods: RhoA, RhoB and RhoC were individually depleted in U373MG glioblastoma cells as well as U373MG cells stably expressing the HCMV IE1 protein (named U373MG-IE1 cells) shRNA lentivirus vectors. Cell proliferation assays, migration as well as wound-healing assays were performed in uninfected and HCMV-infected cells.\nResults: The depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC protein resulted in significant alterations in the morphology of the uninfected cells, which were further enhanced by the cytopathic effect caused by HCMV. Furthermore, in the absence or presence of HCMV, the knockdown of RhoB and RhoC proteins decreased the proliferation rate of the parental and the IE1-expressing glioblastoma cells, whereas the knockdown of RhoA protein in the HCMV infected cell lines restored their proliferation rate. In addition, wound healing assays in U373MG cells revealed that depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC differentially reduced their migration rate, even in the presence or the absence of HCMV.\nConclusion: Collectively, these data show for the first time a differential implication of Rho GTPases in morphology, proliferation rate and motility of human glioblastoma cells during HCMV infection, further supporting an oncomodulatory role of HCMV depending on the Rho isoforms' state. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe above observations are consistent with earlier studies depleting the same Rho isoforms both in prostate and breast cancer cells  [59, 62] . The overexpression of HCMV IE1 protein alone did not bring about any additional effect regarding the phenotype of the Rho knockdown cells, thus excluding any direct modulatory role of IE1 on cell morphology. The morphological changes induced in the glioblastoma cells after RhoA and RhoC depletion remained evident, even in the context of HCMV infection, despite the cytopathic effect caused by the virus, highlighting an imposing role Rho GTPases on cell shape. Although Rho GTPases have been shown to enhance malignant transformation and proliferation rate, RhoB is rather assumed as a negative regulator of these processes  [63, 64] . However, recent data have shown that RhoB expression is induced under conditions such as DNA damage, or treatment with growth factors or cytokines, suggesting that under particular circumstances, RhoB may favor towards human malignancy, including glioblastoma tumors  [65, 66] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nInterestingly, HCMV infection partially restored the growth rate of the RhoA knockdown glioblastoma cells, suggesting that the virus can differentially interfere with the proliferation state of the cells, depending on which Rho GTPase is depleted. This was also the case in the U373MG-IE1 RhoA knockdown cells. Apparently, the expression of IE1 alone and despite the oncogenic properties this protein may possess, it was not sufficient to confer a proliferation advantage to these cells and the active viral gene expression is required. The alterations in the free movement of Rho knockdown cells were also monitored. The cells display diminished movement with U373MG and U373MG-IE1 depleted RhoA, RhoB or RhoC cells lacking their polarization and rather presenting an amoeboid formation with cycles of expansion and contraction of the cell body reinforcing the evidence that Rho GTPases contribute to different features of cancer, such as invasion and metastasis  [72] . Infection with HCMV does not change significantly their motility and they rather show reduced random migration speed.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs regards the U373MG-IE1 cells, the defective closure capacity compared to the empty vector cells was also true when RhoA, RhoB or RhoC were silenced whereas HCMV infection of the same cells resulted in a remarkable increase in the closure efficiency of the wounds (Fig.  7B ). These data collectively indicate that RhoA, RhoB and RhoC play a favorable role in cell migration of glioblastoma overexpressing IE1 protein cells and also that HCMV confers a migration advantage to these cells in Rho proteins depleted cells. \n\nDiscussion\nIn the current study, we demonstrate, for the first time, an implication of Rho GTPases in cell morphology, proliferation and migration in human cytomegalovirus infected glioblastoma cells. Foremost, we observed that knockdown of RhoA resulted in an elongated cell shape with thin protrusions in non-infected and HCMV infected U373MG as well as in their derivative U373MG-IE1 cells. Likewise, depletion of RhoC led the cells to obtain an elongated, mesenchymal-like shape.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we demonstrate that local aggregation over very few chains is a sufficient mesoscopic structure to ensure high mobility, with charge transport mainly occurring along the polymer backbones, and that extended crystallinity is not necessary.

Corning Eagle 2000 glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min each, following by drying with nitrogen. Source-drain electrodes patterns were fabricated using a conventional evaporation procedure through metal shadow mask (channel length 30 \u03bcm, channel width 500 \u03bcm). Five-nanometer-thick Ti was used as adhesion layer of the Au electrodes on glass. The semiconducting polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) (ActivInk N2200; Polyera Inc.) and PS (molecular weight 100 kDa; Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 1,2dichlorobenzene, both at the concentration of 8 mg/mL.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAfter the CYTOP deposition, the devices were annealed under nitrogen, on a hot plate, at 110 \u00b0C for 5 h. Finally, the devices were completed by evaporating a 70-nm-thick Al gate electrode through a metal shadow mask on top of the dielectric layers. Thin Film and OFET Device Characterization. Atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope IIIa AFM; Digital Instruments) was operated in tapping mode to characterize the surface morphologies. UV-absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY-5000; Varian). All of the OFET electrical characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS in air. XRD Measurements. All measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 11-3. The incident X-ray beam was set at a grazing incidence (0.12\u00b0), which was chosen to be above the critical angle of the polymer film but below that of the silicon substrate, ensuring that the full thickness of the film was sampled. Samples were kept in a helium-filled environment during the measurements.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe fibers become more dispersed in lower concentration films and at a P(NDI2OD-T2) content of 1%, the AFM phase image shows poorly interconnected P(NDI2OD-T2) fibers embedded in the PS matrix (Fig.  3F ). The morphologies are isotropic over the macroscopic areas used for charge transport and XRD measurements (Fig.  S5 ). To directly assess the impact of the reported nano-/microscale morphologies on the charge transport properties of the P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS blend, we fabricated top-gate/bottom-contact OFETs. A detailed description of the fabrication process is given in Materials and Methods. It should be noted that P(NDI2OD-T2) is a typical high-mobility n-type semiconductor with a low degree of energetic disorder (32) and both theoretical and experimental studies have shown intrinsically unbalanced electron and hole transport properties in low (i.e., diodes) and high (i.e., OFETs) charge density regimes  (33) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNote that if photons could be cloned, a plausible argument could be made for the possibility of faster-than-light communication 2 \u2022 It is well known that for certain non-separably correlated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of photons, once an observer has made a polarization measurement (say, vertical versus horizontal) on one member of the pair, the other one, which may be far away, can be for all purposes of prediction regarded as having the same polarization 3 \u2022 If this second photon could be replicated and its precise polarization measured as above, it would be possible to ascertain whether, for example, the first photon had been subjected to a measurement of linear or circular polarization. In this way the first observer would be able to transmit information faster than light by encoding his message into his choice of measurement. The actual impossibility of cloning photons, shown below, thus prohibits superluminal communication by this scheme. That such a scheme must fail for some reason despite the well-established existence of long-range quantum correlations 6 on an incoming photon with polarization state Is): IAo)ls)-+ IA.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus no apparatus exists which will amplify an arbitrary polarization. The above argument does not rule out the possibility of a device which can amplify two special polarizations, such as vertical and horizontal. Indeed, any measuring device which distinguishes between these two polarizations, a Nicol prism for example, could be used to trigger such an amplification. The same argument can be applied to any other kind of quantum system. As in the case of photons, linearity does not forbid the amplification of any given state by a device designed especially for that state, but it does rule out the existence of a device capable of amplifying an arbitrary state. Nature Vol. 299 28 October 1982 Milonni (unpublished work) has shown that the process of stimulated emission does not lead to quantum amplification, because if there is stimulated emission there must also be-with equal probability in the case of one incoming photon-spontaneous emission, and the polarization of a spontaneously emitted photon is entirely independent of the polarization of the original. It is conceivable that a more sophisticated amplifying apparatus could get around Milonni's argument.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nW. H.

When a voltage is applied to the tip, the resulting deformation of the sample is monitored through the mechanical displacement of the cantilever-piezoresponse. methods that require comprehensive fielddependent measurements to extract the wall dynamics unambiguously. The development of PFM has allowed the exploration of static and dynamic properties of the domain walls locally for length scales from ~10 nm to 100 \u03bcm, providing an overview of the geometric structure of the wall in the spatial range of four orders of magnitude. Geometry of the PFM setup allows application of the switching voltage both through the conductive probing tip or electrodes deposited at the top of the specimen (Figure  1 ), followed by the imaging of the resulting domain structure. In the case of a highly localized tipgenerated field (Figure  1a ), the polarization reversal occurs through growth of a single domain nucleated at the tipsurface contact.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPFM studies of static and dynamic properties of ferroelectric domains are summarized in this article.\n\nIntroduction\nOver the last two decades, scanning probe microscopy has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of fundamental phenomena in many fields, including superconductivity, spin-resolved transport, charge density wave transitions, protein folding, chemical sensing, and catalysis. A particularly interesting case is piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which is unique in that it probes a tensorial property, the coupling between electric field and mechanical strain. While the first and most obvious application of this technique is to straightforwardly map domains in ferroelectric materials, PFM does much more both in terms of the information content and of applications. Coupling between electric fields and mechanical strain underpins a broader range of phenomena in ferroelectrics and other polar materials. This article highlights recent examples in which PFM directly probes electromechanical interactions in systems ranging from complex ferroelectric materials and piezoelectric compounds to biological tissues. These examples also illustrate that creative variants of PFM or a quantitative approach to data analysis contribute to a fundamental understanding of complex phenomena in solids.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n80  Notably, in highquality epitaxial films, the spatial separation between extended defects such as dislocations can exceed 100 nm,  81  as compared to the ~10-30-nm size of domains detectable by PFM. This comparison suggests that switching can potentially be studied on the level of a single defect.  82  The combination of SS-PFM on artificially engineered defect structures in a bicrystal grain boundary with phase field modeling  83  has provided the ability to decipher deterministic mesoscopic polarization switching in ferroelectrics (Figure  12 ).\n\nGeneral Outlook\nWhile one's initial impression of electromechanical interactions may be that they are significant only in ferroelectric compounds, this is not true. Coupled electromechanical properties are inherent in hundreds of inorganic materials and similarly in biological materials. The evolution of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) provides a new window into the behavior of a wide range of materials. Equally important, the developments in PFM are part of a larger trend toward extreme high-spatial resolution in the quantification of electromagnetic properties.  84  Several classes of properties are now probed at subnanometer resolution.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We found that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, is a ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 23 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], high Curie temperature of 426 kelvin (above that of BTO), large dielectric constant, and low dielectric loss. DIPAB exhibits good piezoelectric response and well-defined ferroelectric domains. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to perovskite ferroelectrics and ferroelectric polymers in sensing, actuation, data storage, electro-optics, and molecular or flexible electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFerroelectricity was originally discovered in Rochelle salt  (8)  in 1921 and later in a few other molecular systems  (9) , but the rapid development of ferroelectrics took place only after the discovery of ferroelectricity in perovskite barium titanate (BTO)  (10)  and lead zirconate titanate (PZT)  (11) . Relative to BTO and PZT, most  molecular ferroelectrics suffer from low spontaneous polarization (P s ), low melting temperature and phase transition temperature (Curie temperature, T c ), small dielectric constant, and weak piezoelectricity; their advantages include light weight, mechanical flexibility, and environmentally friendly processing as they are lead-free. Ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers  (12)  share some of the drawbacks of molecular ferroelectrics, which limits their applications.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe found that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, is a ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 23 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], high Curie temperature of 426 kelvin (above that of BTO), large dielectric constant, and low dielectric loss.

F erroelectrics are multifunctional electroactive materials with a range of applications. Their temperature-dependent spontaneous polarization can be switched by electric field or mechanical forces (1-4), making them attractive for temperature sensing, data storage, mechan-ical actuation, and energy harvesting  (5) . They often exhibit tunable dielectric responses and nonlinear electro-optic effects  (6, 7)  and thus can also be used to manipulate electromagnetic waves  (1) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPhase and amplitude mappings obtained with vertical PFM overlaid on three-dimensional (3D) topography (Fig.  4 , A and B) correspond well to each other, revealing a ferroelectric domain pattern with alternating bands of upward and downward polarizations separated by domain walls; no crosstalk with topography is observed. The piezoresponse is measured to be as high as 360 pm under only 1 V ac, comparable with most other ferroelectrics, thus confirming its excellent piezoelectricity. Lateral PFM overlaid on 3D topography shows phase (Fig.  4C ) and amplitude (Fig.  4D ) mappings in good correspondence with the vertical mappings, despite the out-of-plane polarization direction of the sample. This can be understood from the piezoelectric tensor d of a C 2 point group, with nonzero d 22 and d 25 and spontaneous polarization P 2  (29) , which induces normal and shear piezoelectric strains simultaneously under an electric field applied along the polar axis, whereas for BTO and PZT with out-ofplane polarization, only normal response is expected from symmetry.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

DNA structures have largely remained limited to in vitro applications  (9) . RNA provides a compatible material for in vivo nucleic acid based construction  (10) . It can be produced via the transcription machinery, and forms stable interactions. RNA has been used to build higher-order assemblies in vitro  (11, 12)  and can potentially be used in vivo to engineer the intracellular environment. Here, we engineered synthetic RNA modules that assemble into functional discrete, one-, and two-dimensional scaffolds in vivo, and used them to control the spatial organization of bound proteins (Fig.  1A ). Scaffold D0 was constructed from a single RNA module d0, which folded into a duplex with PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains that bind PP7 and MS2 fusion proteins (Fig.  1B )  (13) . We developed an approach for the in vivo isothermal assembly of extended RNA scaffolds by constructing sequence-symmetric RNA building blocks (Fig.  1, C  and D ) inspired by two-dimensional DNA analogs  (13, 14) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe rules of nucleic acid base-pairing have been used to construct nanoscale architectures and organize biomolecules, but little has been done to apply this technology in vivo.

Spatial organization helps substrates flow between interacting proteins, limits cross-talk between signaling pathways, and increases yields of sequential metabolic reactions  (1, 2) . The ability to organize protein complexes and biological pathways spatially presents a strategy to engineer cells  (3, 4) . The spatial organization of biomolecules has been the focus of DNA nanotechnology  (5) (6) (7) (8) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese RNA strands possess dimerization (DD) and polymerization domains (PD). To prevent the formation of ill-defined networks, it was necessary to disfavor the collapse of the palindromic regions  (15)  and control assembly-order by insuring tile formation before polymerization. We achieved this by designing PDs that fold intramolecularly into kinetically protected hairpin structures (Fig.  1D , step i). The stem of these hairpins is an overlapping shared domain with DD that discourages collapse (Fig.  1D , red segments), allowing DD to \"activate\" PD upon self-binding (Fig.  1D , step iii). We further destabilized the collapsed-state by incorporating wobble-pairs and mispairs (figs. S1 to S4). The one-dimensional RNA assembly D1 was derived from a single RNA d1 with PP7 and MS2 binding domains (Fig.  1E ). d1 assembled into d1-1 (step i), which self-assembled into d1-2 (step iii).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Tough hydrogels are formed, depending on the concentration of ZnSO 4 present in the system.

Reversible decrosslinking/ crosslinking also occurs within the MCP network while the CCP network maintains elasticity throughout.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDOI: 10.1002/adma.201604743\nstretchability, insensitivity to structural defects, and the capacity for self-healing.  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  The strategies employed thus far to achieve these properties are primarily focused on incorporating structured protein domains, such as coiled coils, titin-like motifs, and folded fibrin.  [6, [10] [11] [12]  The interactions between, and/or unfolding of, these structured domains dissipate mechanical energy and maintain high elasticity of protein networks to enhance the strength and toughness of the resultant material.  [13]  Despite these successes, the synthesis of hydrogels containing highly structured proteins is limited by the often relatively low and variable production yield. Additionally, many of these proteins can elicit unwanted biological responses due to their tertiary structure, ultimately limiting material functionality, and use in target applications.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is notable that the level of adhesion strength achieved here is much higher than recently developed nanoparticle adhesives for gels and biological tissues,  [34]  although it is lower than the adhesion of tough hydrogels on various nonporous solid surfaces recently achieved.  [35, 36]  Further investigation into the relative contributions of the metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions to enhance adhesion will be considered in future studies. In summary, we have demonstrated that genetically engineered unstructured proteins with covalent and reversible crosslinking (due to metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions) yield hydrogels with extremely high strength (>2.5 MPa), toughness (>1300 J m -2 ), stretchability (>500%), and self-adhesion in Zn 2+ solutions. A number of future research directions now become possible in both the fundamental understanding of the physical properties of protein-based materials and their practical applications. While we have used reversible metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions for mechanical-energy dissipation to toughen our networks, other reversible crosslinking mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding and ionic crosslinking can also be precisely designed through genetic encoding of recombinant proteins.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These films, while diverse in the range of materials incorporated, behaved similarly in coating the NP systems without compromising the particle shape or significantly increasing the size beyond a few tens of nanometers. Recovered and purified particles visualized by electron microscopy, including SEM and TEM, are displayed in Figures  3  and 4 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nArrays were subsequently crosslinked under vapor-phase glutaraldehyde/ concentrated acid conditions, followed by LbL application (sequential deposition of polycation/wash/polyanion/wash comprising one bilayer).

Following crosslinking, it was observed that particles could be readily functionalized, as evidenced by maintenance of iridescence from the NP array following each processing step (Figure  1E, 1F ). This step therefore allowed for the deposition of water-based polyelectrolytes using Spray-LbL. As shown in Scheme 1, Spray-LbL on PRINT\u00ae nanoparticles, following vapor-phase crosslinking of the PVA support films, is achieved by spraying an aqueous solution of cationic polyelectrolyte is sprayed onto the NP containing films for 3 seconds and, after briefly rinsing with water (3 seconds), an anionic polyelectrolyte is subsequently sprayed onto the films (3 seconds). This cycle can then be repeated indefinitely to control the thickness of the polyelectrolyte coating.

Phonons in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were recently found to exhibit unique thickness dependence due to the interplay between short and long range interactions. Here we report Raman spectra of atomically thin sheets of WS2 and WSe2, isoelectronic compounds of MoS2, in the mono- to few-layer thickness regime. We show that, similar to the case of MoS2, the characteristic A1g and E2g(1) modes exhibit stiffening and softening with increasing number of layers, respectively, with a small shift of less than 3 cm(-1) due to large mass of the atoms. Thickness dependence is also observed in a series of multiphonon bands arising from overtone, combination, and zone edge phonons, whose intensity exhibit significant enhancement in excitonic resonance conditions. Some of these multiphonon peaks are found to be absent only in monolayers. These features provide a unique fingerprint and rapid identification for monolayer flakes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe 1g E mode, which is an in-plane vibration of only the chalcogen atoms, is forbidden in the back-scattering Raman configuration  50, 51  .

In contrast, only one prominent peak can be clearly seen in bulk WSe 2 spectrum in the frequency region where we expect 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks  57  (See Supporting Information). In 633 nm excitation condition, however, multiple peaks are evident in this region (Figure  1d ). There have been inconsistent reports on the assignment of these peaks  7, 31, 32, 47  .

On the other hand, 473 nm excitation is roughly in resonance with the interband transition peak C for WS 2 and interband absorption continuum for WSe 2 . The 633 nm excitation is in resonance with the A excitonic absorption for WS 2 and interband absorption but close to the B excitonic absorption for WSe 2 . Raman features of both WS 2 and WSe 2 strongly depend on the excitation conditions due to energy dependent Raman cross section of the phonons (See Supporting Information for details). The absorption peaks shift slightly with flake thickness  21  but the resonance conditions remain largely unaltered. The crystal structure of 2H-WX 2 belongs to 4 6h D point group. There are 18 lattice dynamical modes at the center of the Brillouin zone ( \uf047 point)  [50] [51] [52] [53] [54]  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe difference in the frequency of these peaks is 60 and 65 cm -1 for monolayer and bulk samples, respectively (Figure  2b ). The intensity ratios ( 1g A / 1 2 g E ) show a similar trend as seen in MoS 2 . The FWHM is found to consistently decrease with increasing number of layers (Figure  2c ). Raman spectra of WSe 2 flakes measured in two polarization configurations and with 633 nm excitation are shown in Figure  3a . In contrast to the case in WS 2 , the parallel polarization spectra of WSe 2 flakes exhibit one prominent peak with a small shoulder in the frequency region where 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks are expected to be observed  57  . The main peak upshifts from 249.5 to 251 cm -1 with increasing flake thickness from monolayer to bulk. In cross polarized spectra, a single peak is observed in this frequency region.

Here we analysed variation at eight microsatellite loci to assess the genetic structure and to infer patterns of larval dispersal for a brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, at an isolated system of reefs in northern Western Australia. Spatial autocorrelation analyses show that populations are locally subdivided, and that the majority of larvae recruit to within 100 m of their natal colony. Further, a combination of F- and R- statistics showed significant differentiation at larger spatial scales (2-60 km) between sites, and this pattern was clearly not associated with distance. However, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled. Individual assignments of these migrants to the most likely populations suggest that the majority of migrants were produced at the only site that was not decimated by a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching event. Furthermore, the only site that recovered to prebleaching levels received most of these immigrants. We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNevertheless, despite these differences between the two studies, our results not only support the finding of high levels of genetic differentiation by  Ayre & Dufty (1994) , but also extend our understanding of the processes underlying these patterns, by providing direct evidence that populations are subdivided on a scale of tens of metres. Consequently, the conclusion that the majority of brooded larvae produced by S. hystrix settle very close to their natal colony is now well supported in two very different ecological systems, irrespective of local environmental conditions and history. Disturbance, broader scale dispersal, and source/sink dynamics Despite this preponderance of local recruitment over scales of tens of metres, we have also presented evidence that S. hystrix larvae periodically disperse over much greater distances. The pairwise F-and R-statistics indicated that some sites separated by relatively large distances were more closely related than those that were nearer to each other. For example, the pairwise R ST comparison between SL4 and SS3 was not significant. Thus, sufficient gene flow over the 40 km of open water between Seringapatam and Scott Reef has prevented genetic differentiation, assuming that the mutation process conforms to the stepwise mutation model.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2002; Palumbi 2003; Cowen et al . 2006) . Investigations have been limited by the considerable difficulties involved in tracking small propagules through the expansive oceans. Because of the resultant lack of direct, empirical data detailing patterns of larval dispersal or retention, researchers have had to draw on a wide range of indirect, interpretative and aggregative studies  (Thorrold et al . 2002; Largier 2003) . Analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation is one such method. Because gene flow reduces genetic divergence, population models are used to partition the genetic variation of a species among different geographical locations, and consequently assess the spatial scales over which they are reproductively closed. However, estimating recent patterns of migration from these models requires several simplified and often unrealistic assumptions  (Whitlock & McCauley 1999) . Alternatively, when highly variable DNA markers such as microsatellites are utilized, the units of analysis can be shifted from populations to individuals, allowing more detailed and direct estimates of gene flow at ecologically relevant scales  (Estoup & Angers 1998) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis pattern contrasts dramatically with the strong and significant differentiation of SS1 and SL1, which occur on the same reef and are separated by only three kilometres. In contrast to microsatellite variation of S. hystrix in the Red Sea  (Maier et al. 2005) , gene flow over these larger scales does not follow an isolation-by-distance model, and seems to be influenced by a number of forces in this system. Primarily, physical links between sites via water currents are likely to play a crucial role in determining the long distance dispersal trajectories of larvae  (Cowen et al. 2006) , and recent genetic evidence suggests that complex hydrodynamics associated with island/reef systems may disrupt patterns of isolation by distance  ( Johnson & Black, in press ). Additionally, we propose that the 1998 bleaching event may also have had two important influences on these broad scale patterns of genetic differentiation. First, S. hystrix at site SL4 was not affected by the bleaching, and had significantly more cover than all the other sites that were decimated. We predicted that these differences in coral survival and reproductive output among sites would translate into differences in numbers of larvae exported.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we report nanoscale nickel oxide/nickel heterostructures formed on carbon nanotube sidewalls as highly effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction with activity similar to platinum. Partially reduced nickel interfaced with nickel oxide results from thermal decomposition of nickel hydroxide precursors bonded to carbon nanotube sidewalls. The metal ion-carbon nanotube interactions impede complete reduction and Ostwald ripening of nickel species into the less hydrogen evolution reaction active pure nickel phase.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the NiO-Ni structure (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). The as-made material exhibited mostly Ni 2 \u00fe species on the surface with a weak shoulder peak at B853 eV from Ni 0 . On Ar ion sputtering of the surface, the detected Ni species were mostly Ni 0 with decreased amount of Ni 2 \u00fe , consistent with NiO-decorated Ni nanoparticles. The Ni K edge spectrum of the sample recorded by X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) further corroborated the co-existence of NiO and Ni (Supplementary Fig.  2b ). Since Ni K edge probed deeper into the material, we could estimate the Ni/NiO ratio B73/27 by linear fitting of standard patterns.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSynthesis of NiFe LDH nanoparticles. In a typical procedure, 160 ml of 0.5 M Ni(OAc) 2 aqueous solution and 32 ml of 0.5 M Fe(NO 3 ) 3 were mixed with 4 ml DMF by stirring. The mixture was heated to and maintained at 120 \u00b0C for 16 h in an autoclave. The temperature was then raised to 160 \u00b0C for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was collected, centrifuged, washed with water and finally lyophilized to get solid NiFe LDH nanoparticles. Materials characterizations. XPS samples were drop dried onto silicon substrate and measured on a PHI VersaProbe Scanning XPS Microprobe. STEM imaging and EELS mapping was performed on a Nion UltraSTEM-100, operated at 60 kV.

Before sample measurement, data were first normalized to the incident photon flux I0 measured with a refreshed gold mesh.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSynergistic effects of NiO and Ni on HER catalysis.

On the other hand, Ni 2 \u00fe reduction was accelerated by raising the annealing temperature to 500 \u00b0C in B1.5 torr Ar, generating Ni nanoparticles (mostly410 nm particles) nearly free of NiO on CNTs (Ni/CNT; Fig.  2c  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ).

These results do not support the notion of a \"slowdown\" in the increase of global surface temperature. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nGiven recent improvements in the observed record  (13, 14)  and additional years of global data (including a record-warm 2014), we reexamine the observational evidence related to a \"hiatus\" in recent global surface warming. The data used in our long-term global temperature analysis primarily involve surface air temperature observations taken at thousands of weather observing stations over land, and for coverage across oceans, the data are sea surface temperature (SST) observations taken primarily by thousands of commercial ships and drifting surface buoys. These networks of observations are always undergoing change. Changes of particular importance include: (i) an increasing amount of ocean data from buoys, which are slightly differ-ent than data from ships; (ii) an increasing amount of ship data from engine intake thermometers, which are slightly different than data from bucket sea-water temperatures; and (iii) a large increase in land-station data that enables better analysis of key regions that may be warming faster or slower than the global average. We address all three of these, none of which were included in our previous analysis used in the IPCC report  (1) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nReports\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report  (1)  concluded that the global surface temperature \"has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past  15 years [1998-2012]  than over the past 30 to 60 years.\" The more recent trend was \"estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend over 1951-2012.\" The apparent slowdown was termed a \"hiatus,\" and inspired a suite of physical explanations for its cause, including changes in radiative forcing, deep ocean heat uptake, and atmospheric circulation changes  (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . While these analyses and theories have considerable merit in helping to understand the global climate system, other important aspects of the \"hiatus\" related to observational biases in global surface temperature data have not received similar attention. In particular, residual data biases in the modern era could well have muted recent warming, and as stated by IPCC, the trend period itself was short and commenced with a strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1998.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHere we present an updated global surface temperature analysis that reveals that global trends are higher than reported by the IPCC, especially in recent decades, and that the central estimate for the rate of warming during the first 15 years of the 21st century is at least as great as the last half of the 20th century.

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn summary, the choice of the descriptors is of vital importance because it is the set of descriptors to which the energy is assigned. The number of descriptors has an immediate impact on the feasibility of any ML potential, as it does not only restrict the efficiency of the energy evaluation but also determines the dimensionality of the coordinate space to be mapped by the training sets. On the other hand, the number of descriptors must be sufficiently large to enable an unambiguous distinction of different structures. In Secs. II B 1-II B 4 several descriptors which have been developed for ML potentials are discussed. This list is by far not complete, and there are plenty of new interesting approaches, which have been proposed recently, like moment tensors,  30  scattering transforms,  31  and many others.\n\nB. Descriptors for machine learning potentials\n\n\nAtom centered symmetry functions\nA ML approach applicable to high-dimensional systems containing large numbers of atoms has been proposed by Behler and Parrinello in 2007 employing NNs.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nGAPs belong to the class of kernel methods, which have the general form E i (d i ) = N basis \ued70 j=1 \u03b1 j \u03c7 j (d i ), (20) i.e., they are linear combination of some basis functions \u03c7 j depending on descriptor d i for the environment of i. The coefficient vector \u03b1 is independent of the specific environment. The energy is expanded in terms of the known data points using a nonlinear kernel function K(d, d i ) providing a measure for the similarity of any two structures or environments, 54 E i = N train \ued70 j=1 \u03b1 j K(d, d j ). (21) GAPs use the squared exponential kernel K SE (d, d \u2032 ) = exp - \ued70 j (d -d \u2032 ) 2 \u03b8 j . (22) Kernel methods are very frequently used. Another example is the combination with a Coulomb matrix descriptor for representing the atomization energies of organic molecules by Rupp et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n45, 46  Starting with NNs 32 in 2007, several different ML approaches suitable for high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms have now become available  38, 40  and are still evolving rapidly.  10, 47, 48  An overview about the increasing use of different ML techniques to the construction of PESs is shown in Fig.  1 . In this section, several ML methods along with their use in the construction of PESs are outlined, which in principle could be combined almost arbitrarily with the descriptors discussed above. Still, currently there are a few dominant combinations of descriptors and ML methods, but this is not because of the compatibility or incompatibility of the different approaches, but it is mainly a consequence of the personal preferences of the developers. \n\nB. Neural networks\nArtificial neural networks are the oldest ML method  49  and they have first been developed to understand the signal processing in the brain. They also represent the first ML method which has been used to fit a DFT PES by Doren and coworkers in 1995,  26  and to date a large number of NN potentials have been developed for many molecular and condensed systems.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The key concept involves self-generation of auxiliary evanescent fields which facilitate the required local power conservation, without interfering with the device performance in the far field. We demonstrate our scheme by presenting exact reactive solutions to the challenging problems of reflectionless beam splitting and perfect reflection, verified via full wave simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis recognition has dramatic implications. For instance, when the GSTCs for passive lossless HMSs are rigorously examined, it turns out that plane-wave refraction cannot in general be realized with zero reflection, as the metasurface symmetric structure can only be matched to a single wave impedance value  [7, 19] . Indeed, the formulation in  [18]  showed that sufficient conditions to ensure passive and lossless design in this case include local power conservation and local wave-impedance equalization, requiring at least one additional diffraction mode, e.g. specular reflection. Although this reflection is minor for small-tomoderate angle refraction, it becomes significant when wide-angle refraction is considered. These observations raised serious questions regarding previously-reported achievements. Primarily, could passive lossless metasurfaces achieve truly-reflectionless engineered refraction? In a recent paper, Wong et al.  [20]  provided a positive answer to that question.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOnce this is established, designing a reflectionless refracting metasurface becomes trivial, as both the incident and transmitted plane waves feature a uniform power profile on the metasurface; local power conservation is thus achieved by proper stipulation of the field amplitudes  [20, 21]  (this result was independently derived in  [24] ). On the other hand, trying to apply this theorem naively for the cases of beam splitting or engineered reflection will fail, as the simple stipulation of the incident and diffracted fields forms non-trivial spatially-varying power profiles on the metasurface, which do not match, in general. Hence, the key concept underlying our solution is the use of auxiliary fields to achieve local power conservation. This approach dictates a judicious stipulation of evanescent field components, additional to the prescribed excitation and desirable scattered fields, such that the interference between all modes guarantees the continuity of the real power at each point on the metasurface plane, without affecting the overall functionality of the metasurface device in the far field.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBut what happens when more than one mode exists below or above the metasurface? When the incident plane wave is to be splitted into two transmitted beams, or reflected in a different direction, the interference between the modes does not allow a proper definition of two distinctive network ports for the top and bottom metasurface facets; this prevents utilization of microwave network theory as in  [20] . In fact, these fundamental diffraction engineering problems have very recently been examined by several authors, which either concluded that inclusion of lossy or active meta-atoms is required for the implementation, or suggested an approximate approach which does not form a valid solution to Maxwell's equations  [4, 24] . To the best of our knowledge, whether or not an accurate design of passive lossless metasurfaces for such applications is possible remains an open question. In this Letter, we propose a different paradigm to tackle these problems. The solution relies on the theorem proved in  [21] , indicating that any field transformation that locallyconserves the real power can be implemented by passive and lossless O-BMSs.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles, birds (sampled with point-counts PC and mist net-MN), saplings, and trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and recurrent-burned forest were higher than between control and once-burned forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation communities in recurrent-burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms acting behind them. Policy-makers need to explicitly address protection of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMANY TROPICAL FORESTS MAY HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY FIRES THAT OC-CURRED ONCE OR TWICE PER MILLENNIUM\n  (Turcq et al. 1998 , Bush et al. 2008 , McMichael et al. 2012) . However, in recent decades, especially in Brazil and Indonesia, fire-return intervals have become decadal or even shorter in some forests  (Cochrane 2003 , Langner & Siegert 2009) . This increase in fire prevalence is primarily caused by an increase in ignition sources from agricultural activities that use fire as a tool for land management  (Laurance 2004 , Cardoso et al. 2008 , Morton et al. 2013 ) and an increase in forest flammability from other human activities, such as logging and fragmentation  (Cochrane 2001 , Siegert et al. 2001) . In addition, fires are often associated with severe droughts  (Chen et al. 2011) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2011) . For example, around 2.6 million hectares and 3.9 million hectares of forest were burned during El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in Indonesia and Brazilian Amazon  (Siegert et al. 2001 , Alencar et al. 2006, respectively) . Most of the predictions of fires associated to climate changes and human land uses in general, state that such events may occur more often in the coming years (e.g.,  Cochrane & Barber 2009 , Fu et al. 2013) , affecting not only Amazon forest, but also the hyper-fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, the interactions between human economic activities, climate change, and fire pose a serious threat for tropical forests. One of the consequences of this increase in fire-return intervals is an increase in the area of forests being subjected to repeated burns, which can alter forest structure and composition when compared to single burns  (Barlow & Peres 2008) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2005) . Recurrent fires may reach into the forest canopy, killing many mid-sized, and large trees and most of the remaining aboveground biomass  (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998 , Cochrane et al. 1999 , Peres 1999 , Cochrane 2003) . While the effects of single fires on tropical forests are relatively well described, much less is known about recurrent fires. For example, single fires change the plant, bird and leaf litter ant species composition  (Barlow et al. 2002 , Barlow & Peres 2008 , Silveira et al. 2013, respectively) , reduce sapling, seedling and tree densities  (Clearly et al. 2006) , and cause substantial reptile mortality  (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998) . Existing studies on the impacts of recurrent fires are primarily focused on plants (e.g.,  Cochrane & Schulze 1999 , Barlow et al. 2003a ,b, Haugaasen et al. 2003a , Slik & Eichhorn 2003 , Toma et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Nevertheless, dendrite growth, side reactions and infinite relative volume change have prevented it from practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a promising metallic lithium anode design by infusing molten lithium into a polymeric matrix. The electrospun polyimide employed is stable against highly reactive molten lithium and, via a conformal layer of zinc oxide coating to render the surface lithiophilic, molten lithium can be drawn into the matrix, affording a nano-porous lithium electrode. Importantly, the polymeric backbone enables uniform lithium stripping/plating, which successfully confines lithium within the matrix, realizing minimum volume change and effective dendrite suppression. The porous electrode reduces the effective current density; thus, flat voltage profiles and stable cycling of more than 100 cycles is achieved even at a high current density of 5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 in both carbonate and ether electrolyte. The advantages of the porous, polymeric matrix provide important insights into the design principles of lithium metal anodes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOn one hand, the use of solid electrolytes to suppress dendrite propagation remains premature in the current stage  [15] [16] [17]  , for they often fall short of meeting the high-power requirement at ambient temperature due to limited ionic conductivity  18, 19  , together with issues such as large interfacial impedance  20, 21  .

Though proven to be effective, most additives will be continuously consumed during battery cycling so that the suppression effect is not fully sustainable  [27] [28] [29]  . Alternatively, the application of a mechanically stable artificial SEI coating such as polymer or solid-state blocking layers has been proposed  [30] [31] [32] [33]  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSeveral important design principles are employed. Firstly, in order to realize negligible volume change, a chemically as well as electrochemically stable matrix is required to sustain a constant electrode volume during cycling. In addition, complete confinement of Li within the matrix is necessary to preserve a constant electrode dimension; therefore, the direct nucleation of Li on the top surface of the matrix should be prevented, as reported in previous studies  31, 34  . Moreover, a porous electrode is desirable since a reduced local current density is beneficial to alleviate dendrite propagation  37, 38  . Following the aforementioned rationale, a Li-coated polyimide (PI) matrix design for metallic Li anode is proposed. The electrospun polymeric fibres guarantee a chemically and electrochemically inert matrix, which is favourable to confine the stripping/plating of Li solely within the matrix. Notably, the choice of PI is rather unique for it is one of the only few high-performance polymers that exhibit excellent chemical stability, heat resistance and mechanical strength above the melting point of Li (180 \u00b0C)  39  . However, the wetting of molten Li on PI polymer is poor.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor example, a promising nanoscale interfacial engineering approach has been demonstrated recently based on interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres, ultrathin two-dimensional boron nitride or oxidized polyacrylonitrile fibres to control the dendrite growth and improve the cycling CE  [34] [35] [36]  . Nevertheless, all these studies adopted the galvanostatic Li plating/stripping approach on a current collector, which is still unable to address the issue of infinite volume change since the electrodes expand during Li plating and shrink during stripping. In addition, contrary to Li-ion batteries where Li ions are stored in prelithiated cathodes, many of the intensively studied high-energy-density battery chemistries (e.g., Li-air and Li-S) involve cathodes in the nonlithiated form. Therefore, it is apparent that a metallic Li anode design with no volume change at the whole-electrode scale and long-term cycling stability in liquid electrolyte is of paramount research importance  3  . Herein, we demonstrate a rational design of metallic Li anode that successfully achieves minimum volume change at the wholeelectrode level and stable, dendrite-free Li cycling.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, dendrite growth and limited Coulombic efficiency during cycling have prevented its practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we report that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt enables the high-rate cycling of a lithium metal anode at high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.1%) without dendrite growth. With 4\u2009M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the electrolyte, a lithium|lithium cell can be cycled at 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 6,000 cycles, and a copper|lithium cell can be cycled at 4\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4%. These excellent performances can be attributed to the increased solvent coordination and increased availability of lithium ion concentration in the electrolyte. Further development of this electrolyte may enable practical applications for lithium metal anode in rechargeable batteries. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nZheng et al.  8  used interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres to stabilize Li surface with a CE of B99% for 4150 cycles. However, no electrolytes have been reported to date that simultaneously overcome all of the challenges-dendritic metal deposition, low CE during Li deposition/stripping processes and poor rate performance-of Li metal electrodes. Most of the approaches reported to date mainly worked at relatively low current densities (o1 mA cm \u00c0 2 ), which are insufficient to meet the requirements for many practical applications (43 mA cm \u00c0 2 )  2, 8, 10, 11  . Therefore, new electrolytes that can lead to the high rate and stable cycling of the Li metal anode are urgently needed for the further development of rechargeable Li metal batteries. Here we demonstrate that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the salt lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI or LiN(SO 2 F) 2 )  30  results in the dendrite-free plating of Li metal at high rates and with high CE.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSeveral years earlier, it was reported by Henderson (one of the coauthors in this work), as well as other researchers, that highly concentrated liquid electrolytes prepared with glyme solvents and lithium salts have both a relatively high ionic conductivity and high oxidative stability  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  . More recently, a number of publications have shown the striking differences between the properties and cell performances for dilute and highly concentrated electrolytes with glyme solvents, as well as other aprotic solvents  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  . One study, in particular, found that highly concentrated LiTFSI-1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/DME electrolytes inhibited Li metal dendritic growth, but the Li plating/stripping CE was reported to be rather low (B71%)  24  . Lu et al.  11  reported that stable Li depositions can be obtained in the liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charging and discharging. Zheng et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOrganic carbonate solvents and LiPF 6 salt have been widely used in Li-ion batteries due to their wide electrochemical stability windows and good compatibility with conventional intercalation electrodes. However, it is well established that the plating/stripping efficiency of Li metal in electrolytes with carbonate solvents such as propylene carbonate (PC) is poor and typically results in dendritic Li metal deposits and a low CE of only o80%  9, 12  . These carbonate solvents can be reduced during Li deposition process and form Li alkyl carbonate (ROCO 2 Li) species and, if trace water is present, may further react to form Li 2 CO 3 (refs 3,13,14). The SEI layers dominated by these components are usually not strong enough to accommodate the rapid changes in the morphology of the plated Li; hence, Li dendrites readily penetrate the SEI layer and lead to battery short circuits.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Multi-geochemical proxies, including different iron speciation and relevant ratios (FeHR/FeT, FeP/FeHR and FeT/Al ratios) and molybdenum concentrations, were used to reconstruct the paleo-depositional environment of this black shale horizon. The ratios of different iron species (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR < 0.80) suggest an overall anoxic conditions (ferruginous) over the deposition of the black shales, although intermittent euxinic (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR \u2248 0.80) and oxic (FeHR/FeT < 0.38) intervals could have occurred. Furthermore, FeT/Al ratios (FeT/Al \u2264 0.51) confirm that water column may not be persistent euxinia during the deposition of the Datangpo black shales. Meanwhile, molybdenum concentrations show a decreasing trend towards the top of the black shales, reconciling the gradual oxygenating trend during this period as stated above. Compared to \u03b434SPy values in the Mesoproterozoic deep ocean, more positive \u03b434SPy values of this study may result from a small size of sulfate reservoir. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nThe Neoproterozoic Era (1000-542 Ma) was an important interval subjected to dramatic climatic changes and biological evolutions in Earth's history. The Snowball Earth hypothesis suggested that the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets during the Neoproterozoic glaciation epoches  (Hoffman et al., 1998) . In the aftermath of glaciations, several lines of evidence, including iron chemistry and sulfur isotopic data from China, Canada, Oman and Australia, indicate stepwise oxygenation of the postglacial Ediacaran ocean (635-542 Ma), stimulating the evolution of early animal life  (Canfield et al., 2007; Fike et al., 2006; Komiya et al., 2008; Maruyama and Santosh, 2008; McFadden et al., 2008) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSouth China block provides a unique window to shed light on the early animal evolution where many biota, i.e., the Doushantuo and Weng'an biota, appeared during the Ediacaran Period (635-542 Ma)  (Chen et al., 2000; Li et al., 2008; Ohno et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 1998) . Until now, variable geochemical signatures, i.e., abundance of iron species and their ratios, molybdenum (Mo) abundance, and sulfur isotopic data, were used to document the Ediacaran oceanic redox changes in South China  (Bristow et al., 2009; McFadden et al., 2008) . In contrast, in the absence of metazoan fossils during the Cryogenian Period (750-635 Ma), less attention was paid to the oceanic changes of that time.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe Datangpo Formation includes the lower thinner black shales (\u223c30 m thick), the focus of this study, and the upper thicker grey shales (\u223c 200 m thick) (Fig.  1B ). A pair U-Pb zircon ages of 663 \u00b1 4 Ma  (Zhou et al., 2004)  and 654.5 \u00b1 3.8 Ma  (Zhang et al., 2008)  for the tuffaceous beds in the basal and topmost Datangpo Formation provides a constraint for the timing of this interglacial interval.\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we choose the Mingle section, where the interglacial Datangpo Formation comprises the lower 30 m-thick black shales and the upper 180 m-thick grey shales (Fig.  1 ). 16 samples, each at approximately 2 m apart, were collected in the lower 30 m-thick black shales for geochemical analysis. For each sample, ca. 5 g of fresh shale was grinded to powder (200 mesh in size) in an automated agate mill.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Yet, half of all the resulting publications appeared since 2000. The history of research before 1998 is described in five stages defined by publication spikes; subsequent work is not covered because historical perspective is lacking. In stage 1 (1871\u20131907), \u2018Cambrian\u2019 (now Neoproterozoic) glaciation was recognized successively in Scotland, Australia, India, Norway, Svalbard and China. Criteria for recognition included faceted and striated pebbles in matrix-supported conglomerates resting on ice-worn bedrock pavements. In stage 2 (1908\u20131940), Neoproterozoic glaciation was shown to have been widespread in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Major textbooks summarized these findings, but the rejection of continental drift (to account for late Palaeozoic glacial dynamics) put a chill on research. In stage 3 (1942\u20131964), the occurrence of glacial deposits within carbonate successions, as well as nascent palaeomagnetic observations, suggested that Neoproterozoic glaciers reached sea-level at low palaeolatitudes, but the belated recognition of sediment gravity flowage caused glacial interpretations to be prematurely abandoned in key areas. In stage 4 (1965\u20131981), the extent of Neoproterozoic glaciation was rethought in light of plate tectonics. Distinctive chemical sediments (iron\u00b1manganese formations and cap carbonates) were identified. In basic climate models, modest lowering of solar luminosity resulted in global glaciation due to ice-albedo feedback, and deglaciation due to greenhouse forcing resulted from silicate-weathering feedback in the carbon cycle. Neoproterozoic glacial geologists were blind to these ideas. In stage 5 (1982\u20131997), reliable palaeomagnetic data combined with glacial marine sedimentation models confirmed that Neoproterozoic ice sheets reached sea level close to the palaeoequator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt ended with overviews of Late Palaeozoic and Lower Cambrian ('possibly Pre-Cambrian') glaciations by Edgeworth  David (1907a, b)  at the 10th IGC, and the winning-over of a skeptical Geological Society in London by a fellow Australian  (Howchin 1908) . Faceted and striated clasts in diamictites were the decisive criteria for glaciogenesis, with a striated subglacial pavement beautifully exposed beneath 'Reusch's Moraine' (Fig.  2 .3) in Finnmark, Norway, for good measure. The second period  saw Neoproterozoic glacial deposits recognized in southern, central and western Africa, central and northern Asia, eastern and western North America and eastern South America (Fig.  2 .1, Table  2 .1). It was evident that glaciation 'at or just before the beginning of the Cambrian' had been more extreme than in the Pleistocene, possibly equal to the composite Late Palaeozoic glaciations of Gondwanaland.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe first Neoproterozoic glacial deposits were found in the SW of Scotland in 1871 and the rate of their discovery on 23 palaeocontinents and microcontinents was essentially linear until 1992 (Fig. \n2 .1). However, half of all the papers (n \u00bc 811) written on them before the end of 2008 were published in the previous 10 years (Fig.  2 .2). This surge in activity is the justification for the present volume, but this history ends at 1997. We lack historical perspective on the last decade and the endpoint eliminates the need to weigh any of the author's own contributions on this topic. This chapter begins by placing the recognition of the Port Askaig boulder beds of Scotland as glaciogenic in its historical context, coming in 1871 on the heels of the discoveries of late Palaeozoic glacial deposits in India, Australia and South Africa. Their inspiration was the Pleistocene glacial controversy of 1837-1865, which spawned both the orbital and 'greenhouse' theories of bidirectional climate change, and established the principal criteria for the recognition of past glaciation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSpjeldnaes (1964, p. 38)  affirmed the glacial origin of strata in different parts of Norway and Svalbard, noting that the eo-Cambrian deposits had been studied 'with the same methods, in the same regions and by the same scientists as have the more easily interpreted Quaternary deposits'. Perhaps the defining summation of the infra-Cambrian glacial problem from this period is  Harland & Rudwick (1964)  in the popular science magazine The Scientific American -which is still worth reading.\n\n-1981: in the wake of the plate tectonic revolution\nPlate tectonics revolutionized the Earth sciences, and Neoproterozoic glacial geology was no exception. It freed the distribution of ancient glacial deposits from the assumption of fixed relative positions of the continents, as foreseen by  Harland (1964a)  and (earlier)  Wegener (1912) , just as the concept of polar wandering  (Gold 1955 ) had freed them from fixed position with respect to the poles.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As suggested previously, a turbulent flow is driven by geothermal heating at the seafloor, which is balanced by a similar heat loss through the ice sheet above. It is argued that the expected horizontal inhomogeneities in these heat fluxes are sufficient to generate baroclinic instability, which drives geostrophic turbulence. Turbulent eddies then transport heat upward and poleward along isolines of constant density, thereby maintaining a statically stable stratification, contrary to previous findings from numerical models that do not adequately resolve the geostrophic turbulence. The kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is expected to be controlled by a balance between the potential energy input by the diabatic forcing and frictional dissipation in the bottom boundary layer. The resulting characteristic flow speed is estimated to be on the order of 1 cm s\u22121, which is in agreement with previous numerical simulations. Eddy diffusivities are estimated to be on the order of 100 m2 s\u22121, which is smaller than in the present-day ocean but probably within one order of magnitude. Because of the weak forcing, the resulting gradients of temperature and salinity would be much smaller than in the present-day ocean, with global-scale potential temperature variations on the order of 0.1 K, again in agreement with previous numerical simulations. The presented theoretical arguments may also be relevant to other planetary bodies with an ice-covered ocean. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs in  Ashkenazy et al. (2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  and  Ashkenazy and Tziperman (2016) , the focus here will be on the so-called hard snowball scenario, where the entire ocean is covered by an ice sheet. Possible implications of the results for a ''Waterbelt''  (Hyde et al. 2000)  or ''Jormungand''  (Abbot et al. 2011 ) state with incomplete ice cover will be discussed in the conclusions.\n\nTheoretical considerations\nIn this section, we will consider what the appropriate boundary conditions for a snowball Earth ocean are and infer constraints for the expected circulation. The inferences will be tested in idealized process-oriented simulations in section 3.\n\na. Boundary conditions and ocean heat transport\nAssuming that the ocean was entirely covered by sea ice, the heat budget of the global ocean would most likely be dominated by a balance between geothermal heating at the seafloor and heat loss through the ice sheet (see sketch in Fig.  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis has important implications for the energetics of the turbulent flow as well as for the parameterization of eddies in ocean models. While  Ashkenazy et al. (2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  use horizontal diffusion in their noneddying models, the results of the present study support the use of a parameterization following  Gent and McWilliams (1990) , where buoyancy fluxes are directed upward along isopycnals. It remains uncertain whether the ocean was entirely frozen over during Earth's snowball events or whether open ocean existed in a small low-latitude region (e.g.,  Pierrehumbert et al. 2011) . While the arguments provided here assume a fully ice-covered ocean, they likely remain relevant for states with an ice-free region near the equator. The warmer atmosphere in the equatorial region (required to maintain an ice-free ocean) as well as an expected freshwater input associated with glacial ice import would likely lead to a relatively warm and fresh top layer in the ice-free region, whose depth is modulated by wind-driven Ekman pumping (e.g.,  Rose 2015) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  and  Ashkenazy and Tziperman (2016)  represents an important first step toward understanding the ocean circulation during snowball Earth events, but more work is needed to fully appreciate the properties of the turbulent flow outside of the equatorial region. This is the goal of this study. Rather than presenting additional global-scale simulations, the focus of this paper is to improve our theoretical understanding of extratropical ocean dynamics in a snowball Earth ocean. What are the expected dominant dynamical processes? What are the energetic constraints? And what does this tell us about the largescale mean state and the transport of heat, salt, and other constituents? The results are expected to provide 1) some theoretical constraints on the ocean mean state and turbulent circulation during a snowball Earth event and 2) a basis for the formulation of ocean eddy parameterizations for use in future snowball world climate simulations.

Graphene has been recently explored as a two-dimensional nanoscale material, and has demonstrated simple device functions based on conventional top-down fabrication. However, the synthetic approach to encoding electronic functionality and thus enabling an entire integrated graphene electronics in a chemical synthesis had not previously been demonstrated. Here we report an unconventional approach for the synthesis of monolithically-integrated electronic devices based on graphene and graphite. Spatial patterning of heterogeneous catalyst metals permits the selective growth of graphene and graphite, with controlled number of graphene layers. Graphene transistor arrays with graphitic electrodes and interconnects were formed from synthesis. These functional, all-carbon structures were transferrable onto a variety of substrates. The integrated transistor arrays were used to demonstrate real-time, multiplexed chemical sensing, and more significantly, multiple carbon layers of the graphene-graphite device components were vertically assembled to form a three-dimensional flexible structure which served as a top-gate transistor array. These results represent a substantial progress towards encoding electronic functionality via chemical synthesis and suggest future promise for one-step integration of graphene-graphite based electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition to contact properties of graphite electrode to graphene channel, advantages of the graphite, compared to metals, lie in its superb mechanical flexibility. We observed that even when graphite electrodes were distorted up to strain of ~2 %, I-V characteristics remained the same (Fig.  2f ). The synthetic method facilitated the creation of a large-scale field-effect sensor arrays composed of monolithic graphene-graphite, which were transferred onto 285-nm SiO 2 / Si wafer. One block of the array contained nine of 2-4 layer graphene field-effect sensors with graphite single common source and independent drains. The sensor chip had four of these blocks composed of 36 sensor devices total, as illustrated in Fig.  3a . The graphite electrode parts were covered with a 2 \u03bcm-thick SU8 passivation layer with openings around the 2-4 layer graphene channels. The current change measured while sweeping Ag/AgCl water-gate voltage at different pH solution is presented in Fig.  3b . The charge neutrality point shifted positively with increasing pH, and the pH sensitivity was ~17 mV/pH.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n3e . Conductance increased (decreased) by switching solutions to higher (lower) pH in p-type regime (watergate potential: -0.1 V), and inverted responses were observed in n-type regime (0.3 V) as complementary sensing. The complementary sensing capability of graphene field-effect sensor is advantageous compared to other unipolar field-effect sensors  30  as it enables discrimination of possible electrical cross-talk and/or false-positive signals. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature and high elastic modulus of the graphene/graphite enable the entire, monolithic arrays in a free-standing form to be floating on water sustainably (Fig.  3f ). By transferring the floating arrays, the integrated device structures of monolithic graphene-graphite can be formed on various non-planar substrates.

From a device perspective, monolithic graphene-graphite structure offers unique potential for flexible electronics/sensors. In comparison to the conventional integrated electronics which have mechanically fragile heterogeneous metal-semiconductor interfaces, our monolithic graphene-graphite devices demonstrate superb mechanical flexibility based on its monolithic interface that could be further explored up to the extent of the intrinsic mechanical properties of graphene/graphite  10  . Furthermore, high thermal conductivity (inplane) and transparent electrical contacts of the monolithic geometries can be advantageous to enhancing the heat dissipation during device operations. In conclusion, we have demonstrated chemical synthesis of monolithic graphene-graphite transistor arrays which can be transferred to various substrates and integrated to multilayer, 3D structures. We believe the capability to synthesize monolithic graphene-graphite integrated electronics provides a promising strategy towards flexible, wearable electronics and implantable biosensor devices, and also suggests substantial promise towards future graphene-based electronics in both two and three dimensions.\n\nMethods\nSpatially patterned, heterogeneous catalyst metal films were prepared by photolithography and thermal evaporation, and atmospheric CVD was carried out for the synthesis of the monolithic graphene-graphite structures.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this article, we map the allosteric network in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A using NMR spectroscopy. We show that positive allosteric cooperativity is generated by nucleotide and substrate binding during the transitions through the major conformational states: apo, intermediate, and closed. The allosteric network is disrupted by a single site mutation (Y204A), which also decouples the cooperativity of ligand binding. Because protein kinase A is the prototype for the entire kinome, these findings may serve as a paradigm for describing long-range coupling in other protein kinases. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs expected for AMP-PNP binding, a cluster of residues within the small lobe of the enzyme is highly sensitive to the addition of nucleotide. The most pronounced changes (\u232c\u2426 \u03fe 0.05 ppm) are observed in residues of the \u24243-strand and the highly conserved glycine-rich loop (\u24241-and \u24242-strands), which actively participate in positioning the nucleotide. Crystal structures have shown that the \u24243-strand flanks the nucleotide-binding site and contains K72, which coordinates the \u2423and \u2424-phosphates of ATP  (13, 14) . Gradual decreases of \u232c\u2426 toward the C-and N-terminal regions from the glycine-rich loop suggest that nucleotide binding affects distal sites within the small lobe of the enzyme. This is evident by the large \u232c\u2426 values for residues that in the crystal structure are \u03fe35 \u00c5 away from helices A and B (Fig.  3 ). A second region is centered at A188 and at the surface of the large lobe where substrate docking would take place (Figs.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2  and 3 ). This large perturbation is important, because crystal structures reveal that the A188 amide group points toward the substrate recognition sequence  (15) . This region contains highly conserved loops, including the DFG loop, which has been proposed to be a switch between active and inactive kinase conformations  (16) . The resonances belonging to the DFG loop (F185, G186, and F187) were broadened beyond detection (see * , Fig.  2 ), indicating conformational interconversion between multiple states, which were silent to the x-ray analysis. Significant changes are observed for residues T201 and G200, which became exchange-broadened; these residues are conserved throughout the Ser/Thr kinase family  (17) . The large perturbations at the peptide positioning loop, with concomitant changes in the DFGand glycine-rich loops, reveal that the nucleotide affects both the small and large lobes, perhaps priming the enzyme for substrate binding. This is supported by x-ray studies carried out by Johnson et al.  (18)  that show ligand-induced conformational changes at these domains.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe 50 residues comprising the C terminus wrap around the two lobes, docking into a hydrophobic pocket located in the small lobe  (3, 4) . Despite sharing a highly conserved core, protein kinases are remarkably diverse in terms of their regulation, activation, and substrate recognition. Crystal structures suggest that kinases are highly dynamic, with allosteric networks that radiate throughout the molecule. Unfortunately, these structures are static and often only include the kinase core. Although there have been extensive studies of kinases in solution, including hydrogen/ deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (H/D-MS), fluorescence anisotropy (5-7), and small-angle x-ray scattering  (8, 9) , these results lack atomic-level resolution and offer an incomplete picture of protein dynamics and recognition mechanisms, presenting a substantial limitation in understanding the enzymatic cycle of kinases, and leaving many questions unanswered. How do these enzymes discriminate cognate and noncognate substrates? What is the role of the nucleotide in substrate recognition? Does allostery play a fundamental role in these recognition processes?\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As a consequence, we are willing to use huge amounts of energy to produce it. Solid-state lighting (SSL) is an emerging technology that promises performance features and efficiencies well beyond those of traditional artificial lighting, accompanied by potentially massive shifts in (a) the consumption of light, (b) the human productivity and energy use associated with that consumption and (c) the semiconductor chip area inventory and turnover required to support that consumption. In this paper, we provide estimates of the baseline magnitudes of these shifts using simple extrapolations of past behaviour into the future. For past behaviour, we use recent studies of historical and contemporary consumption patterns analysed within a simple energy-economics framework (a Cobb\u2013Douglas production function and profit maximization). For extrapolations into the future, we use recent reviews of believed-achievable long-term performance targets for SSL. We also discuss ways in which the actual magnitudes could differ from the baseline magnitudes of these shifts. These include: changes in human societal demand for light; possible demand for features beyond lumens; and guidelines and regulations aimed at economizing on consumption of light and associated energy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMoreover, even if the enclosed indoor areas in which we work and live might ultimately saturate, the unenclosed outdoor areas which we either occupy for short periods during the day or evening, or which are visible from enclosed indoor areas, may be less prone to saturation. Such unenclosed outdoor areas (e.g. streets, parks and other recreation and public spaces) could all be rendered more useful if better illuminated in the evening hours (albeit at the cost of reducing the contrast of the night sky due to light pollution (Boyce 2003)). And there is a natural human tendency to gaze out (we value windows, not just because they are a portal for incoming light, but because of the view they afford (Boyce 2003)) into faraway spaces, even if we do not directly occupy those spaces. We conclude that it is possible that the average unshared illuminated area is nearing a saturation point, but plausible arguments can be made that the saturation point may yet be a factor 10\u00d7 or greater away.\n\nDemand for features beyond lumens\nAlthough the primary demand for light is to illuminate our environment, there are many other features of light that are important to the consumer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, reasonable arguments can also be made that as a human society we are not near a saturation in consumption of light. As discussed in section 5.1, the average illuminance that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours and the average unshared illuminated area that a person is surrounded by may each yet be 10\u00d7 or more from saturation. As discussed in section 5.2, new performance attributes associated with SSL have the potential to unleash new and unforeseen ways of consuming light. As discussed in section 5.3, guidelines and regulations may also have limited influence on light consumption.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn this section we discuss these three possibilities in turn.\n\nSaturation in demand for raw lumens\nAs has been discussed, at current levels of per-capita consumption of light, there is no evidence that we have reached a saturation in the demand for light. It is nevertheless an open question whether we will approach such a saturation in the future or whether per-capita consumption of light will continue to scale linearly with gdp/CoL. To understand this question more quantitatively, we decompose per-capita consumption of light into the product of three factors: I N , the average illuminance foot_11  (or light per unit area, in units of lm m -2 ) that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours; \u03c4 on /(\u03c4 on + \u03c4 off ), a dimensionless illumination duty factor that accounts for how many hours per year the area around a person is actually illuminated and a N /(1 + a N \u03c1 N ), the average unshared illuminated area (in units of m 2 ) that a person is surrounded by  24  . In other words, \u03d5 = I N \u2022 \u03c4 on \u03c4 on + \u03c4 off \u2022 a N 1 + a N \u03c1 N .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It has 22 spectral bands including the day/night band (DNB), which is a panchromatic reflective solar band (RSB) covering a wavelength range of 500\u2013900 nm. Similar to other RSBs, the radiometric calibration of the DNB is in reference to the sunlight reflected from an onboard solar diffuser (SD). As an independent validation to the SD measurement, lunar calibration has been regularly scheduled at nearly constant lunar phase. In this paper, the lunar calibration strategies developed for RSB are extended to DNB. The on-orbit gain coefficient, or the so-called F factor, is derived for DNB low-gain stage (LGS) from lunar data for each lunar calibration event. Its on-orbit change is compared with the change of the LGS SD F factor. For more accurate comparison, the impact of the on-orbit relative spectral responses (RSR) change, caused by the wavelength-dependent degradation of the optical throughput of VIIRS telescope mirrors, must be considered. This impact is more significant for DNB than other RSBs because of its wider bandwidth, and the impact to the SD and lunar calibrations are different due to different scene spectra. Simulation results show a gradually increased deviation of 1% between SD and lunar trends since launch till now and 0.3% deviation since 2 April 2012 lunar calibration, when the lunar F factor was firstly calculated, till now. Taking this effect into account, the on-orbit changes of the SD F factor and lunar F factor agree with each other in less than 0.3%. Our results validate the stability of the DNB SD calibration while demonstrating how the on-orbit RSR change should be considered in the radiometric calibration and data usage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBecause the spectra of the SD calibration and lunar calibration are different, the on-orbit change of the DNB RSR is expected to introduce deviation between the detector gain changes tracked by SD calibration and lunar calibration. In this paper, the deviation is estimated and verified by the measurement.    [Mills, 2010] . Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\nDNB LGS Calibration and Calibration Methodology\nThe DNB gain stages are automatically selected for EV images depending on the radiance level of each pixel. The gain stage information is recorded on a pixel level. For a given pixel, which can be operated at any of the three gain stages, the equation that yields DNB top-of-atmosphere radiance is L DNB \u00bc F LGS;LUT \u00c1 P 2 i\u00bc0 c i;LUT \u00c1dn i DNB RVS DNB;LUT ; (1) where the LGS F factor F LGS,LUT , the background DN offset,LUT , and the adjustment coefficients c i,LUT are regularly updated as look-up tables (LUT). Here dn DNB is background-subtracted detector response DN DNB \u00c0 DN offset,LUT .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe difference between the spectral radiance L and integrated radiance I is the effective bandwidth of DNB changes over time, which peaks at about day 80 since launch and then gradually decreases from 330.5 nm to 325 nm, as is shown in Figure  4c . The RTA degradation is maximal at around 1 \u03bcm and gradually decreases at shorter and longer wavelengths. Because of this, the DNB RSR peak gradually shifts to shorter wavelengths, as is shown in Figure  4d . The center wavelength continuously drifts toward the shorter wavelength range from 707 nm to 687 nm. The impact of the modulated RSR to DNB calibration is reflected from the on-orbit relative change of L and I results, which can be simulated with equations (  4 )-(  7 ). The results are plotted in Figures  4e  and 4f , respectively. The difference between the two trends is the DNB bandwidth change. It explains why the L changes more abruptly than I in the first 80 days and then much less.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe change of the detector gain coefficient F factor can be tracked through lunar calibration, and the results are consistent with the SD calibration within \u00b10.5% for all calibration events since 2 April 2012 when the first lunar DNB F factor can be calculated. Unlike other narrow-band RSBs, the analysis shows that the change of the modulated RSR has much more significant impact to the calibration of the DNB. Also, the impact to the lunar calibration and solar calibration are different due to different source spectra. Taking into account this effect, the difference between the SD and lunar calibration is about 0.3% since 2 April 2012, in terms of the long-term deviation. The seasonal variation observed in lunar calibration result has been attributed to the ROLO lunar irradiance model instead of VIIRS measurement, as is demonstrated by the lunar calibration results of other RSBs as well.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many examples of bio-inspired hard materials can be found in the literature; far less attention has been devoted to soft systems. Here we introduce deterministic routes to low-modulus thin film materials with stress/strain responses that can be tailored precisely to match the non-linear properties of biological tissues, with application opportunities that range from soft biomedical devices to constructs for tissue engineering. The approach combines a low-modulus matrix with an open, stretchable network as a structural reinforcement that can yield classes of composites with a wide range of desired mechanical responses, including anisotropic, spatially heterogeneous, hierarchical and self-similar designs. Demonstrative application examples in thin, skin-mounted electrophysiological sensors with mechanics precisely matched to the human epidermis and in soft, hydrogel-based vehicles for triggered drug release suggest their broad potential uses in biomedical devices. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThese ideas are fully compatible with existing chemistries and materials approaches in tissue engineering, in the sense that embedded lattice structures can provide the necessary mechanical response without altering the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the matrix, as shown for the example in Fig. 1 (ref. 42). Substrates for bio-integrated electronics. These types of bioinspired soft composites represent ideal platforms for stretchable electronic systems that intimately integrate with the human body  [43] [44] [45] [46] [47]  .

The result is a skin-mounted sensor for electrocardiography (ECG) that has sufficiently small thickness and low modulus (at low strain) to maintain conformal contact with the skin, but with skin-like physical toughness (Fig.  6b ) to allow multiple cycles of application and removal without damage to the device or the skin (Fig.  6c ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWet etching eliminated the copper to allowed release for subsequently integration with a soft matrix material.

The nanowires exhibit a uniform diameter of 2\u20133 nm. The length can reach up to several microns. It was found that Cr species produced dumbbell-like nuclei which play a pivotal role in the formation of the Pt nanowires. Such Pt nanowires can be tuned to nanocubes by simply decreasing the concentration of [Cr(CO)6]. Compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst (45 wt%, Vulcan, Tanaka) and Pt black (fuel cell grade, Sigma), the synthesized Pt nanowires exhibit superior performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with a specific activity of 0.368 mA/cm2, which was 2.7 and 1.8 times greater than that of Pt/C (0.138 mA/cm2) and Pt black (0.202 mA/cm2), respectively. The mass activity of Pt nanowires (0.088 mA/\u03bcg) is 2.3 times that of Pt black (0.038 mA/\u03bcg) and comparable to that of Pt/C (0.085 mA/\u03bcg). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCarbon-supported multiarmed star-like platinum nanowires made in aqueous solution displayed high activity and durability  [9] .

Pt nanocubes exhibit a specific activity of 0.278 mA/cm 2 and a mass activity of 0.33 mA/\u00b5g, close to the reported results  [23] . The specific activity of Pt nanowires (0.368 mA/cm 2 ) is 2.7 times that of Pt/C (0.138 mA/cm 2 ) and 1.8 times that of Pt black (0.202 mA/cm 2 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe freshly prepared [Cr(CO) 6 ] solution at 100 \u00b0C was then injected into the [Pt(acac) 2 ] solution.

The large and fast electrochemical deformation resulted from the fact that the PPy film doped with large TFSI anions swelled in PC such that TFSI can insert and expel the PPy film easily, and that a high ionic conductivity in H2O/PC solution enabled to move TFSI quickly. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe PPy film was cut into a 10 mm \u00d7 2 mm strip and set in a one-compartment three-electrode cell described elsewhere  [8]  to measure change in length of the PPy strip by using a laser displacement meter (KEYENCE LE-4000) at typically 0.1 MPa load (under isotonic conditions) on applying potential. The definition of electrochemical strain of PPy actuators was change in length of the strip divided by the original length ( l/l 0 ). When the maximum strain was measured, potential was swept between -0.9 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + by using a potentio-galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research 263A) at 2 mV s -1 in H 2 O/PC solutions of LiTFSI. Electrochemical contraction and expansion were conducted by applying a constant potential of -0.7 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + , respectively, for 100 s except the second expansion (30 s) at room temperature.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe peak response rate was much larger than that (ca. 0.1% s -1 ) of other conventional PPy actuators  [2] , and that (3.2% s -1 ) of a PF 6 --doped PPy by using resistance compensation techniques  [14] . Ding et al.  [15]  prepared a tubular PF 6 --doped PPy with a Pt helical wire, exhibiting up to 13% s -1 strain rate and 5% strain, and we reported a PPy film with a compliant Au electrode at one side, prepared from an MB solution of TBACF 3 SO 3 , showed a peak strain rate of 8.8% s -1 and the maximum strain of 12.1%  [16] . Additional metal electrodes such as the Pt helical wire and the compliant Au thin layer decreased the voltage drop along the PPy actuators, giving fast response rates.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction\nConducting polymers (CPs) such as PPy are promising soft actuator materials potentially applicable to artificial muscle devices because of their large electrochemical stresses  (3) (4) (5)    [1] [2] [3] [4] , 10 times as large as that (0.35 MPa)  [5]  of mammalian skeletal muscles. The applications of CP linear actuators have been, however, quite limited due to their moderate electrochemical strains (1-3%)  [1, 2, 6] . Recently, some PPy actuators with more than 10% electrochemical strains appeared  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , and some of which achieved up to 40% strain  [11, 12] , almost same level as that of skeletal muscles. Such extremely large electrochemical strains were measured when potential was swept at very slow scan rates of 2 or 0.2 mV s -1 . Obviously, most applications of CP actuators require much faster response rates, so CP actuators with large strains and fast response rates are highly expected.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This paper reports the discovery of ultralow thermal conductivity (\u223c0.4 W\u22c5m\u22121\u22c5K\u22121) in single-crystalline, all-inorganic halide perovskite nanowires, which is comparable to their amorphous limit value. We attribute ultralow thermal conductivity to a cluster rattling mechanism, based on strong phonon\u2013phonon scattering via the coexistence of collective motions involving various atom groups. These results call attention to the vital thermal transport processes and thermal management strategies for applications with all-inorganic halide perovskites. Further, CsSnI3 shows a rare combination of ultralow thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, so it can be a promising material for unique applications as an electrically conductive thermal insulator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFurther, the ratio of k lattice to k min of AIHP NWs at room temperature is only \u223c2 for all cases (Fig.  2D, Inset ). This ratio is lower than that of other crystals exhibiting low thermal conductivity (SI Appendix, Table  S1 ), particularly for CsPbBr 3 and CsSnI 3 . We also note that AIHP NWs have far smaller thermal conductivity compared with traditional inorganic oxide perovskites whose values are 2-10 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 (30). To elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the observed ultralow thermal conductivity, we apply a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) (details in SI Appendix)  (31) . Considering the intrinsic uncertainty associated with perturbation theory and DFT-based simulations, the calculated k lattice values without fitting parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values at high temperature (Fig.  2 A-C ). At low temperature, an empirical model is adopted to describe defect and boundary scatterings, and the computed data qualitatively agree with the trend observed in experimental data (Fig.  2 A-C ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBoth of these halide perovskites have been investigated for potential applications in solution-processed optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics  (12, 13) , light-emitting diodes  (14, 15) , and lasers  (16, 17) . However, fundamental study of thermal transport in halide perovskites has been significantly lacking despite its practical and fundamental importance. For HHP, very few experimental studies have been performed for thermal conductivity  (18, 19)  and an ultralow thermal conductivity value of 0.5 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 has been reported for single-crystalline CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 .

Using the cavity method of statistical physics and its relationship to belief propagation, we unveil a phase transition from a regime where we can infer the correct group assignments of the nodes to one where these groups are undetectable. Our approach yields an optimal inference algorithm for detecting modules, including both assortative and disassortative functional modules, assessing their significance, and learning the parameters of the underlying block model. Our algorithm is scalable and applicable to real-world networks, as long as they are well described by the block model. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe results obtained with MC, which can be easily equilibrated for such a small network, are almost identical to those of BP in terms of the parameters and marginals, and identical in terms of the estimated group assignments. This demonstrates that BP is a useful approach even on real, finite networks that are far from trees. Conclusion. We have presented a principled and asymptotically exact analysis of the detection of communities in networks generated by the stochastic block model. There is a strict limit on detectability due to a transition from a phase where the free energy landscape lets us infer the model's parameters, to a phase where it does not. In some cases the communities are detectable, but the problem is hard because the attractive region around the correct fixed point is exponentially small. Our analysis comes with an associated learning algorithm, which for large sparse networks generated from the model is able to learn the number of groups, their exact sizes, and the affinity matrix p ab . Our approach and our algorithm are easily generalized to other local generative models, and we will investigate its performance on a variety of real-world networks in the future.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn many networks, ranging from online communities to food webs, metabolic networks, and genetic regulatory networks, there are communities or modules that play distinct functional roles. A fundamental problem is to detect these communities and understand what role they play in the network's structure and dynamics. In social networks, these communities are often assortative, meaning that there is a higher density of connections within communities than between them, and many approaches to detecting these communities have been proposed (see e.g. \n[1] ). In other networks, however, these modules may consist of nodes with few connections to each other, but which connect to the rest of the network in similar ways. In this Letter we analyze a random generative model for sparse modular networks, known as the stochastic block model. It provides a useful playground for theoretical ideas and the analysis of algorithms, and is a popular model for functional modules in real networks. Using the cavity method developed in the physics of disordered systems  [2, 3]  we exactly analyze the detectability of these modules in the limit of large sparse networks. As a function of the parameters, we compute the phase diagram and locate the associated phase transitions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs a function of the parameters, we compute the phase diagram and locate the associated phase transitions. We distinguish between a detectable phase where it is possible to learn the model's parameters and the group assignments of the nodes, and a non-intuitive undetectable phase where learning is impossible because the network's topology does not retain enough information about the original group memberships. The existence of a phase where a certain class of algorithms is unable to detect communities was previously predicted  [4] , but its location was only found approximately (and its size overestimated). In addition, unlike previous works based on finding a ground state, i.e., minimizing a cost function associated with a group assignment  [4, 5] , our analysis is more general as it relies on the properties of the entire Boltzmann distribution of group assignments. We also unveil a transition from an algorithmically \"hard\" phase, where, we believe, no polynomial algorithm for learning the groups and parameters exists, to an \"easy\" phase where polynomial algorithms do exist. In the latter phase, we show that Belief Propagation (BP)  [6]  works on large networks in essentially linear time as a function of their size.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Potential relationships are typically explored by modeling the network as a function of the nodal attributes or by modeling the attributes as a function of the network. These methods require specification of the exact nature of the association between the network and attributes, reduce the network data to a small number of summary statistics, and are unable provide predictions simultaneously for missing attribute and network information. Existing methods that model the attributes and network jointly also assume the data are fully observed. In this article we introduce a unified approach to analysis that addresses these shortcomings. We use a previously developed latent variable model to obtain a low dimensional representation of the network in terms of node-specific network factors. We introduce a novel testing procedure to determine if dependencies exist between the network factors and attributes as a surrogate for a test of dependence between the network and attributes. We also present a joint model for the network relations and attributes, for use if the hypothesis of independence is rejected, that can capture a variety of dependence patterns and be used to make inference and predictions for missing observations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nA common goal in the analysis of network data is to characterize the dependence between network relations and a set of node-specific attributes. For example in recent years many studies in the social sciences have examined the relationship between individuals' friendship networks and their health measures, such as happiness, smoking and drinking behavior, and obesity (e.g.  Veenstra et al. (2013)  and references therein). Similarly in the biological sciences, scientists are interested in the relationship between how proteins interact and their biological importance (see  Butland et al. (2005)  for example). In each of these applications, parameter vector. The covariate vector x i,j typically includes terms for each attribute of the sender node i and receiver node j, as well as interaction terms measuring the similarity between the sender and receiver attributes. These interaction terms are frequently specified as the absolute difference between the attributes, an indicator of whether an attribute is the same for both the sender and receiver node (in the case of discrete attributes), or the product of the nodes' attributes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAlthough the methods presented here are able to address questions about association between attributes and network relations based on a single cross-sectional dataset, the ultimate goal of much research in the social and biological sciences is to determine causal relationships using temporal network and attribute data. For example, sociologists are interested in determining whether students' friendships impact their health behaviors or whether health behaviors cause changes in their friendship networks  (Bauman and Ennett (1996) ).  Snijders et al. (2007)  and  Steglich et al. (2010)  propose methods for modeling the co-evolution of networks and behaviors using actor-oriented processes whereby actors dictate changes in their behaviors and outgoing ties. These methods focus on binary data, rely on method of moments estimation procedures, and are not applicable to cross-section datasets since they model network and attribute changes conditional on the first observation. A key advantage of the latent variable model approach here is that it warrants a formal testing procedure void of any model selection procedures. Extending these methods to allow for testing of causal relationships between a network and attributes is a future research area of the authors. A historically difficult problem not addressed here is how to select the number of multiplicative factors in the network model.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe improvement was greatest for male drinking frequency and female GPA where prediction mean squared error was reduced by about 15%. This illustrates that when dependence exists between the network and attributes, improvements in the predictions of missing values can be obtained by using both the network and attribute information.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this article we introduced an original approach to testing whether dependencies exist between a network and attribute data, and a joint modeling framework for the network and attributes, which relies on a simplified representation of the network in terms of latent nodespecific factors. As discussed in the Introduction, many others have proposed methodology for investigating the relationship between network and attribute data. The most common methods involve regressing either the network on functions of the nodal attributes or each node's attributes on functions of the attributes of the node's neighbors in the network. Frequently final models are settled upon after some, often undocumented, model selection procedure which not only alters the interpretation of the results, but also adds an additional element of subjectively to the analysis. The key distinction between the previous methods and those presented here is that our method does not involve any model selection procedures and simultaneously tests and estimates first and second order dependencies between the network and attributes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Though such a technology does not yet exist, the technical hurdles for fabricating minimally disruptive, solid-state electrical probes have arguably been overcome in the field of nanotechnology. Nanoscale devices can be patterned with features on the same length scale as biological components, and several groups have demonstrated that nanoscale electrical probes can measure the transmembrane potential of electrogenic cells. Developing these nascent technologies into robust intracellular recording tools will now require a better understanding of device-cell interactions, especially the membrane-inorganic interface. Here we review the state-of-the art in nanobioelectronics, emphasizing the characterization and design of stable interfaces between nanoscale devices and cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDesigning over orders of magnitude\nEngineering the nanoscale interaction between cells and electrodes may be the fundamental challenge to massively parallel intracellular recordings, but a complete in vivo recording system presents additional technical obstacles. For instance, each recording site must transmit information out of the brain (>millimeters) to downstream electronics, which can become logistically challenging as the number and density of the electrodes increases. While up to 512 electrodes have been accommodated by flexible connectors  [19] , dramatically larger numbers of electrodes are probably to require multiplexing and/or wireless transmission. Electrode arrays of up to 26,400 electrodes have been achieved in vitro with multiplexing  [96] , but such a demonstration has yet to be achieved in vivo. Finally, electrode micromotions within the brain can disrupt the recording if the electrode moves relative to the cell  [97] . Ideally the recording site could move independently from the rest of the electronics, such as a wireless device on the brain surface  [98]  or a soft physical tether to the outside world  [19] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nActive mechanical stabilization has been used to correct the micromotion of rigid glass microelectrodes in vivo  [97] , but high density recordings will more probably rely on the compliance of flexible micro-wires or nanowires arrays  [99, 100]  to passively decouple recordings sites from recording electronics. Such a design will be particularly important for awake recordings, where animal movement requires special attention to electrode stabilization  [101] . Indeed, motivated by the difficulty of interfacing rigid structures with brain, there is much ongoing work adapting flexible electronic materials for use in neuroscience  [102, 103] . Flexibly tethered recordings present a different problem, however, as they cannot be delivered deep within the brain without the aid of a rigid shuttle  [102, 103]  or other means of providing reversible rigidity during insertion  [104, 105] .\n\nConclusion\nNanoscale devices show great promise for intracellular electrical recording and have indeed already been used Nanotechnology and neurophysiology Angle, Cui and Melosh 137 for specific applications such as electrophysiological phenotyping of IPSC-derived cardiac cells  [86] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause metallic conductors have greater than 10 7 times higher conductivity compared to typical electrolyte solutions, there is a specific scaling argument for reducing the cross-sectional area of the electrode leads by switching to solid-state devices. Finally, though impressive strides have been made toward the automation and parallelizing patch clamp technique in vivo  [57] , the mechanical requirements for pressure control (i.e. pipette rigidity) are not commensurate with massively parallel recordings. Nanofabrication on the other hand is designed for parallelization, routinely producing intricate structures at the same length scales as cellular components (3-30 nm), meaning that devices can be engineered to interact with cells at a subcellular level  [37 ,42 ] . Integration into readout electronics is also greatly facilitated by working with solid-state electronic probes, and arrays of nanostructures can be bonded by flip-chip methods to high density CMOS electronics for recording  [58, 59]  and stimulation  [59, 60] .\n\nElectrical recording from nanoscale devices\nThere are several distinct approaches to nanoscale electrical recording.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The panel is soft and stretchable, so it can sustain a large deformation. The panel can freely transmit light information because the hydrogel is transparent, with 98% transmittance for visible light. A surface-capacitive touch system was adopted to sense a touched position. The panel can be operated under more than 1000% areal strain without sacrificing its functionalities.

The correlation between the measured currents and the touched position was not influenced by the attachment. The epidermal touch panel could successfully perceive various motions, such as tapping, holding, dragging, and swiping. Thus, various applications can be easily managed by integrating the panel. As shown in Fig.  4 , E to G, writing words (Fig.  4E ), playing music (Fig.  4F ), and playing chess (Fig.  4G ) were accomplished via adequate motions on the epidermal touch panel (movies S3 to S6).

We thoroughly investigated temperature-dependent polarization, dielectric, and impedance spectroscopies, and we found no evidence of ferroelectric effect in a MAPbI3 thin film at normal operating conditions. Therefore, the effect does not contribute to the hysteresis in PSCs, whereas the large component of ionic migration observed may play a critical role. Our temperature-based polarization and dielectric studies find that MAPbI3 exhibits different electrical behaviors below and above ca. 45 \u00b0C, suggesting a phase transition around this temperature. In particular, we report the activation energies of ionic migration for the two phases and temperature-dependent permittivity of MAPbI3. This study contributes to the understanding of the material properties and device performance of hybrid perovskites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe temperature dependence of dielectric loss and conductivity (Fig.  S9 ) also suggests a phase transition between 40 o C-50 o C. Figure  4b  shows frequency spectra of dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and loss tangent. Unusually high values of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032 , similar to those in Refs.  37, 38  , can be seen at low frequencies (970 at 1 Hz and 30 o C), which dramatically decrease by more than one order at higher frequencies. Such a strong dependence of dielectric permittivity, particularly at low frequencies, is not a favorable sign of a ferroelectric nature of the material. At low frequencies, the value of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032 increases with temperature, whereas at high frequencies the trend is opposite but at a much smaller rate. This low-/high-frequency boundary is at ~10 3 Hz for our MAPbI3 thin film.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe dielectric loss \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032\u2032 shows a 1/f behavior for frequencies below a few kHz, following the so-called Jonscher's law, which accurately reveals the ionic conductivity of the material.  39, 40  As temperature increases, a small and wide shoulder (indicated by the arrow in Fig.  4b ) begins to appear and shifts toward higher frequency with temperature. Such a behavior is typical for relaxation processes, found in the generic Debye expression of permitivity.  37  Considering the low frequency and broad peak feature, this relaxation process could be a Maxwell-Wagner type interfacial polarization relaxation, possibly attributed to grain boundary effects or blocking at the contacts. The dielectric loss tangent of the material was found to be high at lower frequencies, especially at lower temperature. The peak value of loss tangent shifts toward higher frequency as the temperature is increased (~1 Hz for 10 o C to ~200 Hz for 70 o C). Moreover, the loss tangent starts increasing with temperature at >100 Hz, and below this frequency the loss tangent decreases with increasing temperature. More work is expected to be done in the future to understand this phenomenon.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, in our systematic polarization measurements and dielectric spectroscopic study, no signatures were detected; but we found significant ionic conduction. Our results suggest that MAPbI3 thin films do not exhibit ferroelectricity at a macroscale in the normal solar cell working temperature range. Other reports at low temperature 31 also did not find any ferroelectric characteristic. Recent theoretical studies  6  suggest that for MAPbI3, the off-center motion of Pb in the PbI6 octahedral is trivial, in contrast to previous calculations that included a large off-center motion component;  15  therefore, only a small ferroelectric polarization could exist, contributed mainly by MA + group. However, the dynamic orientation disorder of the MA + group at normal operating temperatures may result in an average zero polarization at a macro scale, even though a dipole moment may exist in a unit cell or at nanoscale. Our different measurements confirm that no net remnant polarization exists in MAPbI3 thin film at macroscales in the PSC normal operating temperature range.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This study presents the large-scale features of the simulated climates and compares the new model results to those of the atmospheric models from the first phase of the PMIP, for which sea surface temperature was prescribed or computed using simple slab ocean formulations. We consider the large-scale features of the climate change, pointing out some of the major differences between the different sets of experiments. We show in particular that systematic differences between PMIP1 and PMIP2 simulations are due to the interactive ocean, such as the amplification of the African monsoon at the Mid-Holocene or the change in precipitation in mid-latitudes at the LGM. Also the PMIP2 simulations are in general in better agreement with data than PMIP1 simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n5 ). Since the cooling is not as large as in PMIP1 there is more water vapour in the atmosphere and evaporation still occurs along the path of the storm track, which explains the signature in precipitation.\n\nMid-Holocene\nChanges are modest compared to those of the LGM, but reflect the sensitivity of the climate system to changes in the mean seasonal cycle of insolation. In particular, there is nearly no simulated change in annual mean temperature or precipitation for the Mid-Holocene, consistent with no change in global annual mean insolation. The major changes for this period compared to present correspond to an enhanced (reduced) seasonal cycle of temperature in the NH (SH). The continental warming favours the deepening of the JJAS thermal low over land, which intensifies the low level    winds and moisture transport from the tropical ocean to the continent, and thereby intensifies monsoon system in the tropical regions  (Kutzbach et al., 1993; Joussaume et al., 1999) . All models simulate an amplification of the mean seasonal cycle of NH surface temperature.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOver North India, similar conclusions can be drawn (Fig.  9d ). These results show that there is no specific differences between the different sets of simulations, suggesting that the change in precipitation is mostly due to the reduction in the mean water vapour associated to the large-scale cooling across the tropical regions, the reduction in evaporation, changes in the residence time of water in the atmosphere and to changes in water vapour advection  (Yanase and Abe-Ouchi, 2007) . \n\nAfrican and Indian monsoons at the Mid-Holocene\nThe change in MH precipitation over West Africa has been a key focus of PMIP1. Figure  9a  shows that the response of PMIP2 OA MH simulation in JJAS ranges from 0.2 mm/d to 1.6 mm/d (5 to 140%). Both OA and OAV simulations tend to produce larger precipitation changes in this region than PMIP1 SSTf experiments. This increase in precipitation is due to the response of the ocean and the building up of warmer conditions in the subtropics and mid latitudes in the Atlantic north of the equator and colder conditions in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig.  6 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSystematic differences with earlier simulations are also found in the locations of the maximum cooling in the northern hemisphere over the ice-sheet, now prescribed from the ICE-5G reconstruction, which also translate to differences in the change in precipitation along the NH storm tracks. The change in SST gradient in the North Atlantic and the cooling over Eurasia is consistent with data  (Kageyama et al., 2006) . The LGM climate is characterised by a large-scale drying. In the tropical region, the African and Indian monsoons regions receive less precipitation than at present. These changes are very similar to the results found from PMIP1 SSTf and SSTc experiments, which suggests that the dominant factors contributing to the drying is the large-scale cooling which contribute to reduce evaporation over the tropical ocean, and the reduction of the inland moisture transport. For the Mid-Holocene, the new results confirm that the response of the ocean and sea-ice shape the changes in the seasonal cycle of the surface air temperature and precipitation. The sea-ice has a large effect in high latitudes, and in particular in the NH where its reduction during boreal summer strengthens the warming.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We demonstrate that in space-charge limited diodes the hole mobility (micro(h)) of a large variety of organic semiconductors shows a universal Arrhenius temperature dependence micro(h)(T) = micro(0)exp(-Delta/kT) at low fields, due to the presence of extrinsic carriers from the Ohmic contact. The transport in a range of organic semiconductors, with a variation in room temperature mobility of more than 6 orders of magnitude, is characterized by a universal mobility micro(0) of 30-40 cm(2)/V s. As a result, we can predict the full temperature dependence of their charge transport properties with only the mobility at one temperature known. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs expected, the materials with a higher mobility also show weaker temperature dependence due to the reduced disorder. In Fig.  3 (b) the Arrhenius plot is extrapolated to T ! 1. Remarkably, again all measured mobilities originate from nearly one point, again 0 30 10 cm 2 =V s. The occurrence of a single value for 0 for such a large variety of organic semiconductors is surprising since its value is expected to be governed by the amount of electronic overlap between the chain segments. This result would indicate that the packing and resulting wave function overlap would be very similar for the materials studied here. However, it should be noted that the measured mobilities for the conjugated polymers are an average between both intrachain and interchain hopping processes. For intrachain hopping the hopping distance and localization length are about equal, leading to a T ! 1 mobility in a Gaussian DOS of  [22]  0 ea 2 ph  (3)  with a the hopping distance and ph the attempt-to-escape frequency.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMonte Carlo simulations by Ba \u00a8ssler et al.  [5]  showed that this type of charge transport is characteristic for a hopping process between localized sites in disordered conductors. These sites are located in different environments (disorder), and their site energies, determined mainly by electronic polarization, therefore fluctuate from site to site. These fluctuations in the on-site energy of typically 0.1 eV are assumed to be Gaussian. Since they are about 1 order of magnitude larger than the transfer integrals, the wave functions are strongly localized  [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, in order to explain the observed electric field dependence within this Gaussian disorder model an additional spatial correlated potential for the charge carriers is needed, which could arise from charge-dipole interactions  [6] . However, in contrast to the empirical relation Eq. (  1 ) the simulations showed a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the mobility at low fields, given by / exp \u00ff 2=3kT 2 , where is the width of the Gaussian DOS  [5] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, with increasing density [Fig.  1(b) ] E f will pass E eq at a given density, and then E f serves as a new starting point for the hopping transport. With increasing density E f moves closer to E t , leading to an enhanced mobility for larger densities. The relative positions of E f and E eq are crucial to explain the temperature dependence of the charge transport  [11, 12] . Upon cooling down, E eq moves deeper into the tail of the Gaussian DOS, leading to a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence given by ln / 1=T 2 in case of low densities  [5] . For sufficiently high densities [Fig.  1(b)] , meaning E f > E eq , it has been demonstrated by Coehoorn that also within the Gaussian disorder model the transport is governed by an Arrhenius-like ln / 1=T behavior  [12] , as often observed in organic transistors  [13, 14] .

We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems there appears a gapless phase between the QSH and insulator phases in 3D which is in contrast with the 2D case. Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless points (diabolical points) in 3D, but not in 2D. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe present one example. In  [7] , we constructed a fourband tight-binding model for HgTe. It is a zero-gap system, but by opening a gap with uniaxial pressure, it becomes a band insulator. The question here is whether it is a simple insulator or a topological insulator (i.e. QSH). In fact, from the parities of the bands below the Fermi energy E F from the four-band model in  [7] , the Z 2 topological number \u03bd turns out to be even. This disagrees with the result in  [18] . The reason for the disagreement is the following. This model only has four bands near the Fermi energy E F , and the other bands well below E F are discarded. In HgTe, one doubly-degenerate band just below the Fermi energy has a trivial Z 2 topological number, while the other discarded bands deep below the Fermi energy have a nontrivial Z 2 topological number; this leads to the seemingly contradicting results.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThere are a number of equivalent expressions for the Z 2 topological number  [11, 17, 18] , and we only explain the ones relevant for the subsequent discussions, both in 2D and in 3D. We assume that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian has a gap, within which the Fermi energy E F is located.\n\n4\nFirst we explain the 2D case. For I-asymmetric systems, the spectrum is doubly degenerate only at the four points k = k i \u2261 G/2 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), and non-degenerate at other points. In such systems, the Z 2 topological number \u03bd is determined as (-1) \u03bd = 4 i=1 \u03b4 i , (1) where \u03b4 i = \u221a det[w(k i )] Pf[w(k i )] = \u00b11. (2) Here w(k) is a unitary matrix with elements given by w mn (k) = u -k,m | |u k,n , and |u k,n is the Bloch wavefunction of an nth band whose eigenenergy lies below E F .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, in the calculation of the Z 2 topological number, one should be careful because it involves all the bands below the Fermi energy E F . The lesson we can learn from the examples of bismuth  [15]  and other materials  [18]  is that materials with odd Z 2 topological numbers are not rare. In nature, there may well exist systems with odd Z 2 topological number. The crucial difference between the two kinds of topological insulators, namely the QH and QSH systems, is that QH systems require a magnetic field as strong as several teslas, whereas the QSH systems do not require external fields to achieve topological phases. This is a crucial difference. To realize the QSH phase, the effective magnetic field produced from the spin-orbit coupling should be several tesla, as expected from the analogy with the QH system. We see from the examples of bismuth  [15]  and other materials  [18]  that the spin-orbit coupling is strong enough in some materials.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We identify signatures of this Weyl point in the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states, observable in thermodynamic properties. Tunneling between the electron and hole pockets in a magnetic field is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p-n junction in real space. This magnetic breakdown happens at a characteristic field strength that vanishes when the Fermi level approaches the Weyl point. The topological distinction between connected and disconnected pairs of type-II Weyl cones can be distinguished by the qualitatively different dependence of the quantum oscillations on the direction of the magnetic field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1 ). Here we investigate how this process, a momentum space manifestation of Klein tunneling  [22] , affects the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states (de Haas-van Alphen effect), providing a unique thermodynamic signature of the topologically protected band structure (an alternative to proposed transport signatures  [9, [23] [24] [25] ). Because the quantum oscillations are governed by extremal cross sections of the Fermi surface, one might wonder whether some symmetry is required to align the extremal cross section with the Weyl point, so that it becomes observable. Our analysis shows that a magnetic field axis for this alignment exists generically, because of the M\u00f6bius strip topology of the projective plane. We first consider Klein tunneling through a single type-II Weyl point, and then turn to pairs of Weyl cones of opposite helicity, which can be combined in topologically distinct ways  [8] -with a qualitatively different dependence on the Klein tunneling probability.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe contour enclosing the extremal area is denoted by C AE . The two sheets E AE of a type-II Weyl cone are coupled by quantum tunneling. This magnetic-field-induced tunneling between electron and hole pockets is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p-n junction in graphene  [31] , and can be analyzed along the same lines  [32] . The effect of a magnetic field B in, say, the y direction, with vector potential A \u00bc \u00f0Bz; 0; 0\u00de, is accounted for by the substitution k x \u21a6k x \u00fe eBz (setting \u210f \u00bc 1).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[22] .

However, so far there have not been reports of use of this system for efficient correction of a genetic disease. Here we show that mice with a dominant mutation in Crygc gene that causes cataracts could be rescued by coinjection into zygotes of Cas9 mRNA and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the mutant allele. Correction occurred via homology-directed repair (HDR) based on an exogenously supplied oligonucleotide or the endogenous WT allele, with only rare evidence of off-target modifications. The resulting mice were fertile and able to transmit the corrected allele to their progeny. Thus, our study provides proof of principle for use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct genetic disease. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn summary, we have demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to cure a genetic disease in mouse by directly correcting the genetic defect through NHEJ-or HDRmediated gene editing. In the future, it would be of interest to investigate whether similar gene-correction strategies could be used for mutation correction in a setting related to human diseases, such as human stem cells.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nImpressively, by directly injecting Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into zygotes, mice or rats carrying mutations in transgenes or multiple endogenous genes can be generated in one step  (Li et al., 2013a (Li et al., , 2013b;; Shen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013) , indicating that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used as an effective tool for genome engineering  (Gaj et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, successful correction of disease-causing mutations in animal models via the CRISPR-Cas9 system has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we report the efficient correction of a mutant gene in a mouse disease model by zygote injection of CRISPR-Cas9, and we report subsequent successful transmission of the corrected trait to the next generation. We chose a mouse model of dominant cataract disorder caused by a defined mutation in the Crygc gene  (Zhao et al., 2010) . These mice carry a 1 bp deletion in exon 3 of Crygc.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTaken together, our data suggest that while supplying exogenous oligos may not be necessary, the exogenous oligonucleotide could serve as an optional template for repairing the mutant gene, especially when the endogenous allele cannot be used as the template (as in homozygous genetic diseases). In this study, 24 mice were cured of cataracts using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. To further confirm the correction of the disease, we performed histological analysis of lenses prepared from repaired and control cataract mice. As shown in Figure  1I  and Figure  S2H , control cataract mice showed pathological changes in the equatorial region of their entire eyes, but the cataract-free mice that were cured via HDR or NHEJ-mediated gene editing (two or three mice, respectively) exhibited normal histological features. One major hindrance to the therapeutic application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is the potential for offtarget mutations; we therefore examined off-target effects in the repaired mice.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Because of the high structural and chemical variability of polymers that can be created by synthetic approaches, thin films composed of polymers are especially useful in creating a wide range of stimuli-responsive structures. Moreover, since polymer thin films can be patterned by a number of planar techniques such as photolithography, molding, or imprinting, a variety of precisely patterned 2D precursors can be used to fold-up functional structures such as tubular, spherical and polyhedral capsules, biomimetic actuators and even microsurgical tools. This article reviews recent advances and highlights future challenges. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nStimuli responsive materials are expected to play an important role in the creation of multi-functional, smart, reconfigurable, mechanized, and biomimetic structures at a variety of length scales  [1 ] . Self-folding broadly refers to a class of self-assembly systems in which structures curve or fold-up either spontaneously or in response to a stimulus. In the perfect sense of the term, self-folding materials are composed of multiple interconnected units that fold up without any active human control. Selffolding of biomolecules such as proteins is an essential feature of the internal machinery of a cell and a variety of supramolecular and origami inspired strategies have been developed to create synthetic stimuli responsive selffolding molecular structures ranging from self-folding cavitands  [2, 3]  to foldamers  [4, 5]  to DNA boxes  [6] . Folding in these systems is typically mediated by relatively weak interactions such as hydrogen bonds which can be broken or formed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThey were used to retrieve tissue samples from the bile duct, a hard to reach place in the body, thus demonstrating the applicability of these devices in minimally invasive diagnostics. 116 Materials engineering\n\nConclusions\nThe emerging field of stimuli responsive self-folding allows for the creation of smart three dimensional structures. Reversible folding has been achieved with electric and optical signals, pH, ionic strength and solvent exchange while predominantly one-way triggered actuation has been achieved in response to a range of biochemical stimuli. To create biochemically responsive reversible self-folding structures, it would be necessary to utilize thin bi-layers or bi-strips composed of novel polymers such as glucose  [63]  or antigen responsive  [64]  gels. In doing so, it may be possible to create a range of biosensing actuators to enable autonomous functions and biomimetic behaviors. Additionally, while such stimuli responsive structures have been demonstrated at the molecular and the 100 mm to 1 cm length scales, the intermediate 0.1 to 1 mm scale remains relatively unexplored, mainly owing to challenges in patterning polymers and hydrogels with these dimensions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is noteworthy that self-folding methods work at these size scales and 100 nm scaled metallic self-folding polyhedra have already been achieved,  [65]  but similarly sized stimuli responsive polymeric self-folding structures have yet to be demonstrated. Additional developments in the micro and nanopatterning of thin polymer films such as using direct-write  [66]  or imprint  [67]  techniques could enable these advances. It is noteworthy that surface forces have also been applied to curve and self-fold polymeric thin films  [68 ,69 ]  and so called capillary origami has been demonstrated and can even be controlled using electric fields  [70] . However, the capillarity driven reversible self-folding of micro and nanostructures in response to chemical stimuli would require the manipulation of capillary forces such as with surfactants, and this could prove challenging. It is important to note that chemical engineers have an important role to play in the design and implementation of such stimuli-responsive self-folding materials. The diffusion and reaction rates of chemical stimuli interacting with the polymer chains within these thin films determine the time scale of actuation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Numerous studies have detected significant changes in the observed occurrence of extreme heat events, irrespective of how such events are defined. Further, a number of these studies have attributed present-day changes in the risk of individual heat events and the documented global-scale increase in such events to anthropogenic-driven warming. Advances in process-based studies of heat events have focused on the proximate land-atmosphere interactions through soil moisture anomalies, and changes in occurrence of the underlying atmospheric circulation associated with heat events in the midlatitudes. While evidence for a number of hypotheses remains limited, climate change nevertheless points to tail risks of possible changes in heat extremes that could exceed estimates generated from model outputs of mean temperature. We also explore risks associated with compound extreme events and nonlinear impacts associated with extreme heat. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe two hypothetical mechanisms are (1) increased amplification of standing and short wavelength Rossby waves (called \"quasi-resonant\" circulation regimes) and (  2 ) weakening of fast-moving Rossby waves and associated storms. Note that the two mechanisms are active areas of research, and as such their theoretical basis in either the observed or future climate is not established. However, the two hypotheses would be consistent with nonlinear increases in extreme heat events. Furthermore, the hypotheses complement one another as both account for reduced summer weather variability at synoptic time scales, and there is some evidence that both are occurring in boreal summer  [21] .\n\n\"Resonant\" Circulation Regimes\nPlanetary wave influence on midlatitude weather in all seasons is a topic of active research. In the boreal midlatitude summer, amplifying interactions among standing (quasistationary) Rossby waves and fast-moving (free) Rossby waves of similar wavenumber (e.g., 6-8) have been proposed as being critical in producing long-standing heatwaves and other extreme events  [17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 37, 44] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor example, Xu et al.  [68]  project reduced duration of tropical heat waves, because aerosol cooling results in an equatorward shift of the Hadley cell edge, and thus more frequent intrusions of midlatitude air and a decrease in periods of extended stagnation.\n\nDifferential Warming of Land and Ocean\nClimate change is in general expected to warm land more than ocean, which could impact heat waves in multiple ways. Model experiments have confirmed the intuition that increasing summer temperature gradients due to differential land and ocean warming can be an important source of increased summer temperature variability, locally rivaling or exceeding the individual impacts of any changes in circulation or land surface/radiative fluxes  [70, 71] . Shaw and Voigt  [72]  propose that differential land versus ocean warming is one possible explanation for an observed and modeled amplification of subtropical stationary waves in summer-a likely driver for more extreme temperatures. However, they caution that the larger amplitude subtropical stationary waves could be due to other factors besides differential warming, such as wavemean flow interactions with an anthropogenically strengthened subtropical jet  [72] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDifferential warming of land and ocean may indirectly impact heat waves by changing the timing and intensity of monsoons; in many regions, the arrival of the monsoon-with its cloud cover and moisture induced cooling-brings an end to the hottest period of the year, especially as defined by daytime highs. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concluded that, globally, monsoon precipitation was likely to increase this century, with increases in monsoon precipitation extremes very likely in several regions  [73] .\n\nTropical Forcing\nRecent studies have challenged the conventional view that Rossby waves of tropical origin only minimally impact summer midlatitude temperature anomalies (due to weaker tropical modes like ENSO and the inability of Rossby waves to propagate through the easterly wind regimes common in summer)  [20, 37] . Other studies (e.g., Ding et al.  [55] ) have demonstrated that tropical SST anomalies may warm the Arctic, which could in turn impact the midlatitudes, as described in the section \"Planetary Wave Forcing of Persistent Boreal Summer Heat Events?.\"\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The interface quality is found to be strongly affected by the perovskite deposition procedure, and in particular from the environment where the conversion of the starting precursors into the final perovskite is performed (air, nitrogen, or vacuum). The conversion efficiency of the precursors into the hybrid perovskite layer is compared between the different solar cells by looking at the ToF-SIMS intensities of the characteristic molecular fragments from the perovskite and the precursor materials. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the STEM confirms the macroscopic ToF-SIMS findings and allows elemental mapping with nanometer resolution. Clear evidence for iodine diffusion has been observed and related to the fabrication procedure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2.4. Perovskite Conversion Efficiency. Composition analysis with EDX, XPS, and ToF-SIMS have revealed iodine diffusion leading to an inhomogeneous lead/iodine ratio, with marked composition differences between in the capping perovskite layer and the one embedded into the mesoporous TiO 2 layer. It is then crucial to establish whether the constituent elements of the perovskite are present in the desired perovskite form (i.e., CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) or in other forms (PbI 3 or PbI 2 , etc.) as this would allow to compare the perovskite conversion efficiency associated with the each conversion method and environment and determine ionic diffusion testified by the presence of strong signals from iodine fragments.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe presence of regions of constant Pb/I ratio is an indication that in our conditions preferential sputtering does not significantly affect the I/Pb value.  Interestingly, the I/Pb ratio is always lower than the theoretical value of 3. As it will be clarified by the ToF-SIMS analysis, this difference is thought to rely on the presence of \"free\" iodine and precursor elements not converted into the perovskite material (such as PbI, PbI 2 , ...). The iodine at % at the gold surface reaches 6% which testifies that remarkable iodine diffusion takes place through the gold electrode. In XPS quantification Pb and I atoms in any form are (equivalently) counted in the atomic percentage value; the conversion efficiency of the perovskite is thus not accessible through this analysis. For this reason, XPS depth profiling was limited to sample D. In the following sections molecular investigations aimed to identify the exact composition of the perovskite layer were performed with ToF-SIMS. 2.3. Interface Analysis Using ToF-SIMS Depth Profile and 3D Imaging.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn particular, the single-step and double-step deposition routes have been investigated. By STEM analysis, in the double-step deposition procedure the perovskite crystallization environment was found to strongly affect the perovskite domains size and the interface quality. Vacuum processing (VASP) has been found to lead to more compact layers with well-defined interfaces as confirmed by all our characterizations. By ToF-SIMS imaging defects in the underlying layers are found to possibly induce cracks in the perovskite and allow the percolation of the evaporated metal from the top electrode. Moreover, SEM/EDX analysis revealed that the perovskite layer deposited by VASP is inhomogeneous and does not fully infiltrate the mesoporous TiO 2 layer, leading to a lower PCE value. The two step conversion in liquid leads to the highest PCE value due to a homogeneous composition in both the capping perovskite and the mesoporous TiO 2 layer. The air conversion leads to much rougher interfaces, larger perovskite crystal domains, and a possibly higher iodine diffusion toward the HTM layer.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Geochronological tests of this hypothesis have been limited by a dearth of reliable age constraints bracketing these events on multiple cratons. Here we present four new Re-Os geochronology age constraints on Sturtian (717\u2013660 Ma) and Marinoan (635 Ma termination) glacial deposits from three different paleocontinents. A 752.7 \u00b1 5.5 Ma age from the base of the Callison Lake Formation in Yukon, Canada, confirms nonglacial sedimentation on the western margin of Laurentia between ca. 753 and 717 Ma. Coupled with a new 727.3 \u00b1 4.9 Ma age directly below the glacigenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate on the Congo craton (Africa), these data refute the notion of a global ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. A 659.0 \u00b1 4.5 Ma age directly above the Maikhan-Uul diamictite in Mongolia confirms previous constraints on a long duration for the 717\u2013660 Ma Sturtian glacial epoch and a relatively short nonglacial interlude. In addition, we provide the first direct radiometric age constraint for the termination of the Marinoan glaciation in Laurentia with an age of 632.3 \u00b1 5.9 Ma from the basal Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada, which is identical, within uncertainty, to U-Pb zircon ages from China, Australia, and Namibia. Together, these data unite Re-Os and U-Pb geochronological constraints and provide a refined temporal framework for Cryogenian Earth history. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n635 Ma (Fig.  3 ). The long duration (>55 m.y.) of the Sturtian glacial epoch implies a relatively short Cryogenian nonglacial interlude (<25 m.y.), consistent with a repeated trigger for glaciation related to the tectonic background conditions that drive weathering and the consumption of CO 2 on 1-10 m.y. time scales  (Mills et al., 2011) . This updated Neoproterozoic chronology provides new constraints to test and refi ne climate models of a long-duration glacial epoch and the nature of a relatively short nonglacial interlude. The Os i data presented here confi rm enhanced weathering of juvenile crustal material prior to the onset of the Sturtian glacial epoch, consistent with a basalt weathering trigger for initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch (e.g.,  Godd\u00e9ris et al., 2003; Rooney et al., 2014) . These ages confi rm the central prediction of the snowball Earth hypothesis of long-lived (~10 m.y.) glaciation with globally synchronous deglaciation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Sharad\n\nExcerpt 2: \nINTRODUCTION\nAfter more than one billion years without robust evidence of glaciation, Cryogenian (ca. 850-635 Ma) strata record arguably the most extreme episodes of climate change in Earth's history. The widespread occurrence of lowlatitude glacial deposits on every paleocontinent, coupled with the unique geochemistry and sedimentology of cap carbonates  (Hoffman et al., 1998; Bao et al., 2008) , inspired the snowball Earth hypothesis  (Kirschvink, 1992) . However, the general paucity of radiometric age constraints from multiple paleocontinents for the onset and demise of Cryogenian glaciations (Sturtian ca. 717-660 Ma, and Marinoan ending ca. 635 Ma), as well as reports of putative pre-Sturtian glaciations  (Frimmel et al., 1996) , has fostered doubts about the synchronicity and global extent of these events (e.g.,  Allen and Etienne, 2008; Kendall et al., 2006) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDISCUSSION\nThe existence of a pre-Sturtian, global Kaigas glaciation has been suggested from the apparent relationship between inferred glacial deposits and the following age constraints: a 741 \u00b1 6 Ma Pb-Pb zircon evaporation age in the Gariep belt of the Kalahari craton  (Frimmel et al., 1996) ; a 740 \u00b1 7 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age from near the base of the Bayisi diamictite on the Tarim craton  (Xu et al., 2009) ; and a 735 \u00b1 5 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age from the Kundelungu Basin of the Congo craton  (Key et al., 2001) . However, previously published U-Pb and Re-Os ages from time-equivalent strata in Laurentia  (Karlstrom et al., 2000; Macdonald et al., 2010a; Strauss et al., 2014)  and the Re-Os age presented here from the Callison Lake Formation (Fig.  2A ) document nonglacial sedimentation from ca.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A total of 274 sequences were analyzed and assigned 48.00% Proteobacteria, 10.30% Actinobacteria, 9.90% Bacteroidetes, 6.60% Verrucomicrobia, 4.80% Acidobacteria, 1.80% Firmicutes, 1.50% Chloroflexi, 1.50% TM7, 1.10% Deinococcus-Thermus, 0.70% Planctomycetes, 0.70% Gemmatimonadetes and 0.40% Cyanobacteria. Economically important phyla Actinobacteria was second most dominant group after Proteobacteria, in our clone library. It would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. An additional 12.8% of clone library (35 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) from 43 clones) with less than 94% similarity to any GenBank sequence could not be assigned to any known phylum and may represent unidentified bacterial lineages and suggests that a large amount of the rhizobacterial diversity remains to be characterized by culturing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe observation that sequences related to Proteobacteria phylum made up the largest fraction of clone library in this study is consistent with previous findings that the phylum Proteobacteria, which is metabolically versatile and genetically diverse, comprises the largest frac-  tion of the bacterial community in soil ecosystems, including the rhizosphere  [26] . The representation of genera Devosia is interesting as, previously these genera have been detected as a nitrogen fixing nodule former in Neptunia natans (L.f.) Druce  [27] , other dominant phylotypes were relatives of well known genera Rhizobium/ Mesorhizobium/ Rhodoplanes. 16S rRNA gene fragments related to Rhizobium was also recovered from maize roots and it was noted that pea was grown in the field site prior to maize cultivation  [28] . It is also possible that Rhizobium is a native member of non-legume rhizospheres  [29] . Pseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe data derived maize rhizosphere in this study is particularly important since little 16S rRNA sequence information has been previously reported. In earlier studies using culture-based methodologies, members of Actinobacteria were shown to be the second most abundant bacterial group present on the roots and leaves of maize, after the Alphaproteobacteria  [22] . Molecular fingerprinting analysis of maize rhizobacteria confirmed that Actinobacteria formed dominant populations on maize roots in a tropical soil. It was also found that members of the Bacteroidetes group constituted dominant populations in the rhizosphere of maize and of canola  [23] . Members of this bacterial group are capable of degrading complex macromolecules, thus contributing to the turnover of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus  [24] . The analysis of a clone library of the maize rhizobacterial community indicated that Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria were dominant populations  [25] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria. Cloned 16S rRNA genes affiliated with Pseudomonas were also infrequently recovered from rhizosphere soil samples  [30] . Pseudoxanthomonas has been known to use as bioremediation as reported earlier by Sanchez et al.  [31] . Most interestingly, the economically important phyla Actinobacteria was the second dominant group in our clone library, and among most dominant OTUs with 5 clone sequences was close relative of genera Streptomyces. This genera is of economical importance because of its antibiotic producing ability. Streptomyces, act as antagonists to many different phytopathogenic fungi, detection of chitinolytic activity of Actinomycetes also makes them promising candidates as biocontrol agents for diverse fungal diseases. Presence of phyla Actinobacteria in the rhizosphere opens the possibility of exploring them to identify members with antagonistic properties toward some economically hazardous plant pathogens.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Such approaches have been recently proposed and applied to improve plant and animal health [citation 64].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Artificial ecosystem selection \nAbstract: Artificial selection has been practiced for centuries to shape the properties of individual organisms, providing Darwin with a powerful argument for his theory of natural selection. We show that the properties of whole ecosystems can also be shaped by artificial selection procedures. Ecosystems initiated in the laboratory vary phenotypically and a proportion of the variation is heritable, despite the fact that the ecosystems initially are composed of thousands of species and millions of individuals. Artificial ecosystem selection can be used for practical purposes, illustrates an important role for complex interactions in evolution, and challenges a widespread belief that selection is most effective at lower levels of the biological hierarchy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInoculation of microcosms, planting, and harvesting were carried out under sterile conditions so as to minimize contamination of the microcosms. Two sets of high and low lines were initiated in which the size of the soil inoculum differed by two orders of magnitude (6.0 g vs. 0.06 g). Each line consisted of 15 units and the 3 units with the highest (or lowest) value of the phenotypic trait were used as parents by combining the soil from the 3 units into a slurry that was used to inoculate the ''offspring'' generation of units. Fifteen microcosms per generation for the high and low treatments of the 6.0-g and 0.06-g inoculum sizes and two control treatments led to a total of 90 microcosms per generation for the complete experiment, which was continued for 16 35-day ecosystem generations. In generations 1 through 9, we ran sterile control treatments to serve as baselines that consisted of high and low selection lines inoculated with autoclaved 6.0-g slurries.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn all of our experiments, the ecosystems are laboratory microcosms that are physically small but large in biological terms, initially including thousands of species of bacteria, algae, protozoa, fungi, and other small organisms numbering many millions of individuals. An ecosystem is defined as the interactions of species with each other and their physical environment. Because two of the phenotypic traits (pH and degradation of the toxic compound 3-chloroaniline) are properties of the physical environment and the third trait (aboveground plant biomass) is likely to be mediated through effects on the physical environment, our experiments qualify as selection at the ecosystem level.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nAll selection experiments require a population of units, a phenotypic trait that forms the basis of selection, and a method for creating a new generation of units from the selected units of the previous generation. In the soil ecosystem experiments, the units were transparent containers designed to grow plants under microbially controlled conditions (GA-7 acrylic vessels and couplers; Magenta Corporation, Chicago). Each container was filled with 85 g of well-mixed potting soil that was dried and rewetted with 25 ml of water and sterilized by autoclaving within the containers.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNor were there any significant differences or trends when comparing sterilized, nonselected 6.0-g inocula and 0.06-g inocula in generations 11-15 (no control treatments were run in generation 16). In the aquatic experiment, the pH of the nonselected control line closely resembled that in the line selected for greater acidity, indicating that the divergence between the experimental lines largely was attributable to ecosystem selection for decreased acidity. Response to selection at the phenotypic level presumably requires an underlying change in ecosystem processes that cause the phenotypic traits in a proximate sense. We tested this proposition for the 6.0-g soil experiment by analyzing the soil of the control, high, and low lines at the time of harvest during generations 13 and 14. The discriminant function analysis (Fig.  3 ) clearly discriminates among the three lines on the basis of soil properties. Because the soil was identical at the beginning of each generation, these differences reflect a divergence in the biotic components of the ecosystems that change the soil chemistry over the course of a generation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Understanding Microbiomes: Genes Vs. Organisms. The imaging approach cuts through the overwhelming complexity of detail in microbial communities and allows common patterns to shine through. With deep sequencing, it has become clear that many taxa in the oral microbiota are shared across individuals but are abundant in some samples and almost vanishingly rare in others  (19, 38) . These differences in abundance may result from real differences between individuals, fluctuations within a single individual over time, or a combination of the two. Whatever its cause, the lack of a consistently abundant microbial \"core\" has led to the idea that perhaps it is not organisms but genes and functions that are conserved within the microbiome, distributed across a variety of organisms whose identities are irrelevant. The discovery of hedgehog consortia argues against this idea, at least for some microbiomes.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe discovery of hedgehog consortia argues against this idea, at least for some microbiomes. The consistency of the composition and structure of the hedgehog across many individuals suggests that organisms are highly relevant to understanding the roles, organization, and dynamics of the members of the consortium. We suggest that it is neither necessary nor desirable to disregard taxonomy and reduce the microbiome to a collection of genes or metabolites unmoored from their source organism. Instead, we suggest the converse, that an understanding of the ecology and physiology of the organisms in the consortium will provide an organizing principle for understanding and interpreting metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. The consortium that we have described is composed of organisms of not only different species but nine different genera classified into eight families in five phyla. Thus, it is a consortium not of close relatives but of highly disparate organisms. The intimate association of widely diverged taxa may be a general property of spatially organized microbial consortia.  Darwin (41)  was the first to recognize that the \"struggle for existence\" was most severe between closely allied forms and that \"divergence of character\" would support the greatest amount of life.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) ) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2 -eq. yr(-1) ), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn all cases, former agricultural land (i.e. cropland plus grazing land area) would become available for nonfood purposes (afforestation or bioenergy crops) if stocking densities on grazing land were increased to higher, but still sustainable, levels; the latter were derived from spatially explicit data on the productivity of grazing areas (see  Erb et al., 2009 Erb et al., , 2012a,b;,b; Haberl et al., 2011) . Table  2  shows the GHG reductions that could be achieved in 2050 by using the spare land for afforestation, assuming a CO 2 sequestration of 11.8 t CO 2 eq ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (based on  Smith et al., 2000) . GHG reduction resulting from bioenergy was calculated using two different assumptions: a high value was calculated assuming that biomass produced in short-rotation coppice or energy grass plantations would replace fossil fuels, thereby saving 18.3 tCO 2 -eq.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFAO (2011)  estimates that the area of current cropland production is 15.6 million km 2 , with an estimated additional 27 million km 2 potentially available as prime or good land for the cultivation of conventional food and feed crops. FAO projects that the cropland area may expand by about 1.5-2.0 million km 2 up to 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario, where most of the increase in food supply will come from intensification  (Fischer et al., 2011) . Land is used for many purposes, e.g. production of goods and services through agriculture and forestry, housing and infrastructure and absorption or deposition of wastes and emissions  (Dunlap & Catton, 2002 ). Many of these functions limit the ability to deliver others, e.g. the area required for crops is not available for forestry or housing, leading to competition for land. In some cases land use is related to the nature of land, e.g. forestry on steep, rocky slopes; in other cases land can be used for several purposes, illustrated in particular by small farmers and indigenous groups in developing countries.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nno-tillage agriculture), reduced deforestation, peatland conversion or afforestation (forest area) and bioenergy production, either from primary or secondary biomass sources (e.g. residues).

Geographic distribution of global agricultural lands in the year 2000 \nAbstract: Agricultural activities have dramatically altered our planet's land surface. To understand the extent and spatial distribution of these changes, we have developed a new global data set of croplands and pastures circa 2000 by combining agricultural inventory data and satellite-derived land cover data. The agricultural inventory data, with much greater spatial detail than previously available, is used to train a land cover classification data set obtained by merging two different satellite-derived products (Boston University's MODIS-derived land cover product and the GLC2000 data set). Our data are presented at 5 min (\u223c10 km) spatial resolution in longitude by longitude, have greater accuracy than previously available, and for the first time include statistical confidence intervals on the estimates. According to the data, there were 15.0 (90% confidence range of 12.2\u201317.1) million km2 of cropland (12% of the Earth's ice-free land surface) and 28.0 (90% confidence range of 23.6\u201330.0) million km2 of pasture (22%) in the year 2000. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[34] Our final predicted cropland extent of 15.0 million km 2 in year 2000 amounts to roughly 12% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), and pasture extent of 28.0 million km 2 amounts to 22% of global land area. Thus humans are using 34% of the global land area for their agricultural needs.\n\nGeographic Distribution of Croplands and Pastures in Year 2000\n[35] We analyzed the distribution of agricultural regions by 14 different regions of the world (Table  5 ). The greatest proportion of croplands in the world are found in South Asia, Europe, Southeast Asia, and United States, east of the Mississippi, while the greatest proportion of pastures are found in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, Pacific developed countries, China, Mexico and Central America, United States, west of the Mississippi, and tropical Africa. The smallest proportion of croplands are found in Canada, the Pacific developed Countries, and northern South America, while the smallest proportion of pastures are found in Southeast Asia, Canada, and United States, east of the Mississippi.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFirst, there is much misunderstanding and confusion regarding the definitions of croplands and pastures. In this study, we have followed the FAO definition, as described in section 2.2 (paragraph 2). For croplands, this includes temporary fallow lands (less than 5 years), which are not cultivated. It is not clear how strictly this restriction of less than 5 years was applied when accounting for fallow land. For example, the U.S. data on croplands used by FAOSTAT includes idled cropland, which includes land under the Conservation Reserve Program that amounts to roughly 9% of the total cropland area, and is often idled for longer than 5 years  [Lubowski et al., 2002] . Secondly, in tropical nations characterized by extensive fallow cropping systems, such a definition may include much land that is not currently cultivated, and therefore portray a misleading picture of what may be commonly thought of as cropland. Finally, these definitions of croplands say nothing about the productivity of the land, but this is the topic of our companion article  [Monfreda et al., 2007] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[38] We also investigated the frequency distribution of croplands and pastures globally, and across the 14 different regions of the world. We calculated probability distributions using all pixels with nonzero cropland or pasture values, and estimated what proportion of total cropland or pasture area can be attributed to different categories of cropland or pasture proportions (Figure  9 ). Globally, we find that a large proportion of the total cropland area comes from land that is between 60% and 80% cultivated. This pattern is observed in most regions of the world, except in northern South America, tropical Africa, and North Africa and Middle East (where larger number of pixels with low proportion of cultivation contribute most to the total cropland area, although in the latter two regions, there are a few pockets of greater than 90% cropland). With pastures, the total area is dominated by pixels with greater than 90% pasture. This pattern is true over most regions of the world, but is reversed in the eastern United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia (and South Asia, to a lesser extent).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Still, there is evidence of an \u201cemerging supermarket revolution in India\u201d [citation 37], driven by domestic capital.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Surprised by supermarkets: Diffusion of modern food retail in India \nAbstract: Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the patterns and dynamics of the diffusion of modern food retail in India.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper is based on detailed sales data from retail chains in India, short case studies of retail chains, and review of literature.\nFindings\nThe article presents three surprises concerning modern food retail diffusion in India. First, modern retail has developed in three \u201cwaves\u201d, with the first wave, government retail chains, starting in the 1960s/1970s, cooperative retail chains starting in the 1970s/1980s, and private retail chains in the 1990s/2000s. All three were substantial, and internationally uniquely, all three coexist in the 2000s as segments of modern retail. Second, the rise of modern private retail in India in the past six years has been among the fastest in the world, growing at 49 percent a year on average over that period, and bouncing back to growth after a dip from the recent recession. The great majority of modern private retail has arisen in 2007\u20102010. Third, beside the uniqueness of the coexistence of three types of retail noted above, Indian private retail chain development has unique or rare characteristics: driven by domestic capital investment, \u201cearly\u201d (in terms of usual international patterns) diversification into small formats, \u201cearly\u201d penetration of small cities and even rural towns, of the food markets of the poor and lower\u2010middle class, and of fresh produce retail. These unique factors have helped to propel it quickly.\nOriginality/value\nFor the first time in the literature, the paper presents an analysis of: the three waves in Indian retail; detailed sales data for all leading chains; and its uniqueness. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMoreover, the most heated debate related to retail at this very moment (mid 2011) is whether multi-brand retail FDI should be liberalized. We do not take a side in this debate. We simply note what our findings suggest: whether or not retail FDI is liberalized, modern retail diffusion looks on the path to continue, even at its rapid pace of several times GDP growth, for some time. The \"drivers\" on the demand and investment supply side do not look to diminish. FDI liberalization may accelerate it, would probably (by definition) multinationalize it, may increase the overall level of retail \"development\" by bringing more international experience and technologies to bear; it would probably (as it has in China and elsewhere) create more \"procurement doors\" for two way flows of imports of products, and exports of Indian agricultural goods. Researchers focussed on food industry, agricultural economics, and agribusiness have a rich agenda before them to explore empirically, with rigorous surveys, the impacts on supply chains, and their actors of the emerging supermarket revolution in India.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n4. Third surprise: private-retail revolution with unique Indian characteristics Various characteristics, especially of the second phase of the third wave -the private retail chain boom -are surprising, both to India, and about India compared with the past two decades of developing country modern retail diffusion. The essence of the differences is twofold. First, India has done what few other developing countries have done: started a supermarket revolution with domestic capital without relying at first on the push from retail FDI. Second, India has done what most other developing countries have done -but done them \"earlier\" (in the evolution of modern retail in the country), more simultaneously, more experimentally, more variously. We lay out the surprising differences below.\n\nPrimarily domestic investment\nIt is common for domestic (family company) capital to be important in the earliest stages of supermarket development in developing countries, but for the \"take-off\" some sector well-endowed with capital steps in and drives the investment. Sometimes that sector leads and then other sectors compete in investment and thus the aggregate investment grows.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSeveral points are salient. First, as expected given that India has not liberalized multi-brand retail FDI, the rate of multinationalization is low and its impact in this second phase on Indian retail modest, and cash & carry, large, so far. In 2010, about 7 percent of total only-retail sales (like Latin America in the early 1990s) and 99 percent of major cash and carries (like Latin America now), i.e. in India 0.75 billion USD of sales was done by FDI firms (sole or joint venture), hence 15 percent of the total of modern-private retail and wholesale chain sales. Second, domestic modern-retail capital is from a mix of sources, according to the investing company's characteristics.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We then discuss the energetics, structural evolution, and variations in electronic and mechanical properties of crystalline and amorphous Li\u2013M alloys. Our calculations show that Li insertion is the least favorable in Si and the most favorable in Sn owing to its large effective interstitial space and softer matrix. Upon Li incorporation, the bonding strength of the host network is weakened, attributed to the transferred charge from Li. Li interstitials can migrate easily in all three host materials with a moderate migration barrier in Si and small barriers in Ge and Sn. Because of the cation repulsive interaction, Li atoms tend to remain isolated and well dispersed in M; also induced by this cationic nature is the charge redistribution toward Li, leading to the strong screening/shielding effect in Si, in which the excess charges are highly localized, and a relatively weaker effect in Sn. According to our mixing enthalpy calculations, alloying between Li and M is energetically favorable with Li\u2013Sn alloys being the most stable, followed by Li\u2013Ge and Li\u2013Si alloys. On the basis of structural, electronic, and mechanical property analyses, we also demonstrate how the incorporation of Li atoms with increasing concentration leads to the disintegration of host networks and softening of the Li\u2013M alloys, and associated with the more flexible lattices, the volume expansion at fully lithiated states are 434 (399)% (Si), 382 (353)% (Ge), and 305 (259)% (Sn) for amorphous (crystalline) Li\u2013M alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus far, there has been no comprehensive comparison study on Si, Ge, and Sn as to the dynamic behavior of Li incorporation, the stability of the host lattices, and the properties of the alloys formed during lithiation. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C\n\nARTICLE\nIn this paper, we first examine the structure, stability, Li diffusion, Li\u00c0Li interaction, and how the host lattice M (M = Si, Ge, and Sn) is affected by Li insertion using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The group IV elements are found to adopt the diamond crystalline structure, which allows a comparative study on the nature of Li in different host materials, but the same diamond structure. Although other allotropic structures are found for Ge and Sn (\u03b2-Ge and \u03b2-Sn 18 ), they do not serve a particular interest in this study. We then examine the structure, energetics, and mechanical and electronic properties of Li\u00c0M alloys. The structural evolution in terms of Li content is analyzed for both crystalline and amorphous phases, and the relative stabilities of the alloys are evaluated based on their mixing enthalpies.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2. Electronic Structure and Charge Distribution. Figure  1  shows the electron density of states (DOS) of Si, Ge, and Sn before and after the insertion of a neutral Li atom at the T-site. Upon the Li incorporation, the Fermi level shifts above the conduction band minimum, indicating that the charge transferred from Li partially fills the conduction band of the host. A grid-based Bader charge analysis  31  predicts the amounts of electron transfer from the inserted Li to the Si, Ge, and Sn lattices to be 0.83e, 0.85e, and 0.87e, respectively; in the calculations, special care was taken to ensure convergence with respect to the grid size. To evaluate the charge redistribution induced by the Li incorporation in the host matrix, the charge gain of the atoms adjacent to Li was calculated.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn particular, the large volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process (up to 400% for Si, 370% for Ge, and 300% for Sn)  3\u00c05  can cause cracking and pulverization of the electrodes. Considerable efforts have been made to overcome these problems through structural modifications  6\u00c011  and alloying with active/inactive elements.  12\u00c016  First-principles calculations have also been applied to investigate fundamental aspects of the lithiation behavior and structural evolution of the anode materials, yet many of which still remain unclear. Despite the similarities shared among the group IV materials, Si has received the most attention because of its highest known capacity, whereas the analogous systems have not been studied as closely, and some of their merits as an anode material may have been overlooked in the past. For instance, the diffusivity of Li in Ge is about 400 times greater than that of Li in Si at room temperature,  17  which may contribute to faster charge/discharge rates.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Using Fe@SiO2 nanoellipsoids as anisotropic building blocks, herein we demonstrate a new class of magnetically responsive photonic structures whose photonic properties can be dynamically tuned by controlling the direction of the magnetic fields they are exposed to. These novel photonic structures diffract at a minimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle, and a maximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel direction; and the diffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is moved off-angle. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[1]  Easily found in nature, such as opals,b ird feathers,a nd butterfly scales,s tructural color is brilliantly iridescent, metallic,a nd free from photobleaching unlike conventional pigments or dyes.Most colloidal assembly processes mimic the formation of opals and create close-packed structures from monodisperse colloidal spheres.H owever,l iving systems often involve non-closepacked ordered assemblies of anisotropic motifs,s uch as plates and rods,t hus display significantly more complex structural color responses including strong angular dependence and polarization effect.  [2]  Prior efforts have been made to organizing elongated particles,s uch as polystyrene and ZnS,  [3]  albeit the assembly methods are rather conventional and the resulting crystals do not exhibit different photonic responses to those from spherical particles. One of the important advantages of anisotropic particles is that they often have shape-dependent physical and chemical properties,which can add more degrees of freedom for manipulating the collective properties of the resultant superstructures.This is of particular interest to the fabrication of field-responsive colloidal photonic structures,i nw hich static or dynamic structural changes are usually accompanied by switching of photonic properties.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAssembled from uniform shape-and magnetically anisotropic nanoellipsoidal particles,t he novel colloidal crystals diffract at am inimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle and am aximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel.

These data indicate that chloride levels started rising in the mid-19th century and began accelerating in the early twentieth century. Lake Superior's and Lake Michigan's concentrations have continued to increase steadily and currently stand at their maximum recorded levels. In contrast, lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario reached peak levels between 1965 and 1975, but then began to decline. However, recent data indicate that the chloride concentrations in these lakes are now increasing again. Because loading data are not readily available, a mass-balance model is employed to estimate the chloride inputs required to account for the concentration trends. This inverse analysis yields computed load reductions that are consistent with reported industrial load reductions during the last three decades of the 20th century. Hence, it appears that the improvements were for the most part attributable to industrial controls. The model is also used to predict that if loads are held fixed at 2006 levels, concentrations in all lakes will continue to increase with the most dramatic rise occurring in Lake Michigan which will ultimately approach the level of Lake Erie. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nBecause it is conservative, has low natural background levels, and is readily measured with adequate precision, chloride has long served as a general indicator of anthropogenic impacts on Great Lakes water quality. Beyond its utility as an indicator, chloride can also have direct adverse impacts on lakes and other freshwater ecosystems. The Canadian federal government has recommended that road salt be added to the List of Toxic Substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act because of tangible threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage  (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2001) . It has also been suggested that increases of chloride and other ions could be directly harmful to the Great Lakes ecosystem by fostering the spread of less-desirable halophilic organisms  (Stoermer, 1978) . More generally, trends of all major anions and cations are relevant as they contribute to aspects of lake chemistry such as ionic strength, pH and acid neutralizing capacity. Finally, at sufficiently high concentrations, chloride can influence density stratification as well as degrade the taste of drinking water. Two classic papers first established that Great Lakes chloride levels had increased significantly over the past century.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor example, the recent chloride increases in the upper lakes that are shown here are at least partially attributable to increased loadings that occurred in the past. The recent increases in the lower lakes are shown to be in part attributable to increased road salt usage in the watersheds and possibly also new or resuming industrial inputs. Beyond their water-quality implications, the chloride trends serve as \"canaries in the coal mine\" and show that, despite many improve-ments in Great Lakes water quality, human influences continue to impact offshore water quality. Furthermore, recent impacts may be as serious as past influences, and the sources may now be more diffuse and difficult to control. Consequently, vigilant stewardship based on continuous monitoring and scientific study must be vigorously supported in order to adequately protect this treasured system.\n\nTime-variable solutions\nGiven initial conditions for concentration, Eqs. (  5 ) through (9) can integrated numerically to obtain solutions. To do this, we use Heun's 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method  (Chapra, 2007)  with a step size of 1 year.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOther possible non-industrial chloride sources include (a) potassium chloride (KCl) use in agricultural fertilizers and (b) ferric chloride use for phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater. Modern chemical potash fertilizers usually contain potassium chloride, which is 47.5% by weight chloride. Consumption of potash as an agricultural fertilizer increased rapidly in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s and may have been a factor in the increases in chloride concentrations during this time period. However, U.S. agricultural potash fertilizer use peaked in 1981 and stabilized during the 1980s and 1990s  (USDA, 2008) . Although local increases may have occurred in the Great Lakes basin over this period, there is currently no direct evidence to confirm this hypothesis. The chloride concentration of untreated municipal wastewater ranges from about 20 to 160 mg/L (O'  Connor and Mueller, 1970; Sonzogni et al., 1983; Metcalf and Eddy, 2003) . In the 1970s, many wastewater treatment plants in the Great Lakes basin added ferric chloride to enhance phosphorus removal.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe proportion of regulated proteins closely paralleled the total number of phosphorylations of nuclear proteins. As expected, proteins annotated as extracellular were significantly underrepresented in the phosphoproteome. Although there is evidence of a mitochondrial phosphoproteome  (Pagliarini and Dixon, 2006) , proteins annotated as mitochondrial by GO were underrepresented, as were plasma membrane proteins. As membrane proteins are often of low abundance and we did not specifically enrich the plasma membrane in this analysis, we are less likely to identify phosphorylation events associated with them. Conversely, proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, which are generally of higher abundance, were almost twice as likely to be detected in the phosphoproteome as compared with their proportion in the database, and they accounted for an even higher share of the regulated sites. This illustrates that, at the current state of technology, our phosphopeptide screen is still not comprehensive. We may also miss certain phosphopeptides that are either too small or too large in mass to be readily measurable in our current MS setup. Therefore, absence of a phosphorylation site from our data set does not necessarily mean that it does not exist.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs in the case of SwissProt, close to 90% of our data are novel compared with these previous studies. Taken together, our data suggest that, despite several decades of research into phosphorylation, most in vivo phosphorylation sites have still not been detected.\n\nPhosphoproteome Dynamics\nEGF signaling begins with activation of the EGF receptor and extends through a cascade of downstream kinases to mediate the increased phosphorylation of a large number of substrate proteins. The overall levels of phosphorylated proteins within a specific cellular compartment are also affected by other processes, including dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, protein degradation via ubiquitination, and translocation of the protein to another subcellular location. Our experiment measures the net effect of all these diverse processes that collectively regulate the dynamic phosphoproteome. To search for patterns in the time profiles of the regulated phosphopeptides, we explored several clustering techniques. Clustering algorithms have been applied extensively to the analysis of gene-expression data, including time-series data sets.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhile acquisition and especially analysis of the data is currently very time consuming, advances in automation should make quantitative phosphoproteomics easier to perform in the future. A global, unbiased view of the in vivo phosphoproteome reveals that a large proportion of cellular proteins are phosphorylated and that only a small subset of total phosphorylation sites are regulated in response to a stimulus. The observation that individual phospho-sites on a protein are typically regulated differently suggests that proteins generally serve as integrating platforms for a variety of incoming stimuli. This integration of signals could be independent, with phosphorylation of each site occurring separately from the others, or it could be dependent, for example, on when a ''priming site'' is necessary for subsequent phosphorylation events. While phosphorylation is not the only regulatory system in the cell, it is intimately tied to many other systems, as demonstrated here by identification of regulatory sites on ubiquitin ligases, GEFs, actin-binding proteins, RNAinteracting proteins, and other important protein classes. Our data also pinpoint a large number of transcriptional regulators or coregulators to which the growth-factor stimulus is distributed.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Ten specimens representing different joints were used and five criteria of osteoarthritis were scored. Eleven of the 38 participants ranked themselves as beginners, 13 as experienced and six as very experienced; the data were subsequently examined using the results from these 30, comparing beginners with experts. Agreement as to whether or not changes were present on the specimens and on the degree of change was seldom complete but was greater when scoring eburnation and the presence of new bone on the joint surface than for the three other criteria. There was little difference between beginners and experts.\nAlthough all the specimens were chosen to meet our published criteria for osteoarthritis, the experts were unanimous is agreeing the diagnosis in only three cases and the beginners in only one.\nThese results suggest that more work needs to be done to develop operational definitions for the classification of disease in palaeopathology and that great care must be taken when comparing disease frequencies between studies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nIn epidemiological studies of joint diseases, where results from different observers are to be compared, it is common to estimate the degree of variation between the observers;l'Z if the variation is small, then the conclusions drawn from such studies will have more credibility than if it is great. Now that epidemiological techniques are increasingly being applied to palaeopathology it seemed important to make some assessment of the extent of inter-observer variation amongst its practitioners when scoring diseased joints, since to the best of our knowledge this has not been attempted before.\n\nMaterials and methods\nEach of the specimens used in the study (and illustrated in Figure  1 ) was considered to have 1047-482x/91/010049-08$05.00 @ 1991 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd the features of osteoarthritis by the criteria that we have published b e f ~r e . ~ Briefly, these criteria state that osteoarthritis is present when there is eburnation on the joint surface or, in the absence of eburnation, when two of the following are present: marginal osteophytes, new bone on the joint surface, pitting on the joint surface or deformation of the joint contour.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn general, there was better agreement about the diagnosis when eburnation was present, although three of the experts and two of the beginners did not diagnose specimen 10 as having osteoarthritis even though there was an obvious area of eburnation on the inferior surface of the head of this metatarsal. O n e practical outcome of this study must be that greater efforts will need to be taken to agree on the criteria >for the classification of pathological changes in palaeopathology. What is required for palaeopathological work is the development of operational definitions, since it is not valid entirely t o rely on either clinical or radiological diagnoses. For example, we have shown that radiology is not reliable in detecting changes that are evident to the palaeopathologist.' Finally, these results demonstrate that great care must be taken when comparing disease frequencies between studies unless the authors cite the criteria used in arriving at their classifications o r use a common, agreed source of reference.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe chose to carry out the study using bones that showed some or all the features of osteoarthritis on the grounds that osteoarthritis is the most common disease found in human skeletal remains and so most experienced palaeopathologists would have had plenty of practice at observing it, and also because we thought that it was comparatively easy to tell whether or not the characteristic changes were present, whatever the cause of the changes may have been.  What has emerged from the study is that more than half the observers. What is even there is seldom complete agreement as to more disturbing, however, is that experts selwhether pathological changes are present and dom achieve more consistent results than beginthat agreement on the severity of the changes ners. Of course we have to enter the caveat here that are seen is seldom likely to be achieved by that the self-rating may not have been entirely accurate and that some bias is very likely in the direction of experienced workers under-rating themselves, but w e have no means of checking this since the study was carried o u t anonymously. There was also considerable disagreement when it came to attributing the diagnosis of osteoarthritis to the specimens.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAlthough no polyhedral analysis was carried out, the usefulness of these inequalities has been demonstrated through computational experiments. A comparison with version 8.1 of CPLEX shows that the branch-and-cut algorithm proposed here reduces both the CPU time and the number of nodes explored in the branch-and-bound tree. The methodology proposed in this paper obviously cannot be used to solve large-scale instances containing hundreds or thousands of users as it is sometimes the case in large cities. It is, however, fast enough to be used as a post-processor to optimize individual routes or small subsets of routes produced by a meta-heuristic. In the presence of ride time constraints, using dynamic programming would be difficult since the states of the dynamic programming algorithm would have to take into account the individual ride time of each user. Future work will concentrate on the development of more refined separation procedures for the various types of inequalities introduced in this paper. for U 1 must visit node n + i 2 before visiting node i 1 . In addition, this path must appear immediately before the arc (i 1 , n + i l ) in the solution.

These constraints are very similar to the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin subtour elimination constraints for the TSP  (Miller et al., 1960) . One can reduce the number of variables and constraints in model (  1 )-(  14 ) by using aggregate time variables B i at every node except the origin depot 0 and the destination depot 2n + 1.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn the first set of instances, Q = 3 for every vehicle, q i = 1 for every user and the maximum ride time L is equal to 30 minutes. In the second set, Q = 6 for every vehicle and the values of q i are chosen randomly according to a uniform distribution on the set {1, . . . , Q}. The maximum ride time is set equal to 60 minutes. In all cases, we assume that service time is proportional to the number of passengers and d i = q i . The maximum route duration is set to 720 minutes. The first set of instances represents the context where cars are used for the transportation of individuals whereas the second set reflects the situation of a transporter using mini-busses for the transportation of individuals or groups of individuals.

Based on a combination of molecular characteristics typical of many Precambrian bitumens, their consistently and unusually high thermal maturities, and their widespread distribution throughout the Hamersley Basin, the bitumens can be characterized as \u2018probably of Archean age\u2019. Accepting this interpretation, the biomarkers open a new window on Archean biodiversity. The presence of hopanes in the Archean rocks confirms the antiquity of the domain Bacteria, and high relative concentrations of 2\u03b1-methylhopanes indicate that cyanobacteria were important primary producers. Oxygenic photosynthesis therefore evolved > 2.7 Ga ago, and well before independent evidence suggests significant levels of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. Moreover, the abundance of cyanobacterial biomarkers in shales interbedded with oxide-facies banded iron formations (BIF) indicates that although some Archean BIF might have been formed by abiotic photochemical processes or anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, those in the Hamersley Group formed as a direct consequence of biological oxygen production. Biomarkers of the 3\u03b2-methylhopane series suggest that microaerophilic heterotrophic bacteria, probably methanotrophs or methylotrophs, were active in late Archean environments. The presence of steranes in a wide range of structures with relative abundances like those from late Paleoproterozoic to Phanerozoic sediments is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean, 900 Ma before visible fossil evidence indicates that the lineage arose. Sterol biosynthesis in extant eukaryotes requires molecular oxygen. The presence of steranes together with biomarkers of oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria suggests that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in some regions of the upper water column was equivalent to at least \u223c1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) and may have been sufficient to support aerobic respiration. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSo far, the oldest known dinosteranes come from the \u03f31.1-Ga Nonesuch Shale, Michigan  (Summons and Walter, 1990) . The biologic precursor of dinosteranes is dinosterol that is commonly regarded as diagnostic for dinoflagellates  (Robinson et al., 1984; Summons et al., 1987 Summons et al., , 1992;; Moldowan et al., 1996; Moldowan and Talyzina, 1998) , although it has also been recorded in one diatom species as a minor component  (Volkman et al., 1993) . As fossil dinoflagellates (and diatoms) first appear in the Mesozoic, dinosteranes discovered in Paleozoic and Proterozoic sedimentary rocks were described as products of ancestral dinoflagellates (protodinoflagellates)  (Moldowan et al., 1996) . However, dinosteranes of Archean age have more likely a biologically independent origin, as ancestral dinoflagellates and diatoms almost certainly appeared much later in Earth history.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSterols with the 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestane skeleton (C 30 ) have also been isolated from prymnesiophyte algae of the order Pavlovales  (Volkman et al., 1990) , and with the 4-methylcholestane skeleton (C 28 ) from the methylotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus  (Bird et al., 1971) . Regular 4-methylsteranes are therefore not sufficiently taxon-specific to interpret their occurrence in Archean bitumen below domain level. 4\u2423,23,24-Trimethylcholestanes (dinosteranes) also occur in trace amounts in the Archean bitumens  (Brocks et al., 2003) . Dinosteranes are abundant biomarkers in almost all Mesozoic and Cenozoic bitumens  (Moldowan et al., 1996)  but have also been detected in the Paleozoic and Proterozoic, albeit in lower concentrations  (Moldowan et al., 1996) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMost bitumens throughout post-Archean Earth history contain similar distributions of C 26 to C 30 -steranes, A-ring methylated steranes, mono-and triaromatic steroids and their diagenetic rearrangement products  (Summons et al., 1988b) . The late Archean bitumens studied here also have the same general sterane and aromatic steroid pattern  (Brocks et al., 2003) . It is highly unlikely that such steranes in Phanerozoic and Proterozoic sediments had an eukaryotic source but had a prokaryotic origin in the Archean. Although it is possible that as yet unknown or extinct prokaryotic organisms produced sterols, the wide structural range of steranes present, their relative abundances like those of younger bitumens, and their marked dissimilarity to known prokaryotic examples is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean  (contra Cavalier-Smith, 2002) . Although sterane distributions in the Archean bitumens are equivalent to those of younger bitumens, they offer no taxonomic information below domain level.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here it is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that proper intensification of ionized impurity scattering to charge carriers can benefit the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) by increasing the Seebeck coefficient and decreasing the electronic thermal conductivity. The optimal strength of ionized impurity scattering for maximum ZT depends on the Fermi level and the density of states effective mass. Cr\u2010doping in CeyCo4Sb12 progressively increases the strength of ionized impurity scattering, and significantly improves the Seebeck coefficient, resulting in high power factors of 45 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 with relatively low electrical conductivity. This effect, combined with the increased Ce\u2010filling fraction and thus decreased lattice thermal conductivity by charge compensation of Cr\u2010dopant, gives rise to a maximum ZT of 1.3 at 800 K and a large average ZT of 1.1 between 500 and 850 K, \u224830% and \u224820% enhancements as compared with those of Cr\u2010free sample, respectively. Furthermore, this study also reveals that carrier scattering parameter can be another fundamental degree of freedom to optimize electrical properties and improve thermal\u2010to\u2010electricity conversion efficiencies of thermoelectric materials. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 24 ]  The increase in the Seebeck coeffi cient, due to the fi ltering of low-energy electrons by ionized impurity scattering, compensates or even overcompensates the reduction of mobility, giving rise to the power factor enhancement. This effect is in principle analogues to the fi ltering effect created by energy barriers.  [ 3 ]  Particularly, thermal conductivity can also be lowered due to the reduced electronic contribution and the intensifi ed phonon point defect scattering, and thus a large enhancement in ZT can be expected. The comparisons between the experimental data and the numerical calculations (solid lines) are shown in Figure  3  b-d. These calculations without any adjustable parameter show good agreement with the experimental results, especially for the Seebeck coeffi cient and the electrical conductivity. The discrepancies are mainly attributed to the variation of the Fermi level, as indicated in Table  1  . This further verifi es the rationality of the present simple model. The fi ts between calculated and experimental power factors are less satisfactory, mainly due to the variation of \u03b7 and large uncertainty of PF (\u224810%).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[ 14, 18, 24 ]  This effect is analogue to the prediction by Ioffe  [ 25 ]  about a half century ago, however, rather precise control of the impurity scattering strength is required to realize power factor and ZT improvements in heavily doped semiconductors.  [ 26 ]  Indeed, Ioffe's initial experimental work about PbTe gave no enhancement in power factor or ZT ,  [ 25 ]  and subsequently numerical calculations done by Ure  [ 24 ]  predicted no more than 10% enhancement in ZT by introducing ionized impurities. These may have contributed to the dormancy of studying the infl uence of ionized impurity scattering on thermoelectrics, and to the best of our knowledge only limited experimental results have been reported.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n6660 wileyonlinelibrary.com achievements in thermoelectrics. However, in many instances \u03ba L has already been lowered to the amorphous limit, suggesting that further enhancement in ZT should come from the improvement of power factor ( PF = \u03b1 2 \u03c3 ) or the decrease in electronic thermal conductivity. \n[ 10 ]  Strategies such as carrier concentration engineering  [ 2, 11 ]  and band structure modifi cation  [ 12 ]  have been identifi ed to be effective for PF and ZT enhancements. Besides being pertinent to the electronic band structure and the Fermi level, electrical transport properties are also closely related to the carrier scattering processes, including phonon scattering, impurity scattering, energy barrier scattering, etc.  [13] [14] [15]  Above room temperature, lattice vibrations generally dominate the carrier scattering for most of the thermoelectric materials, e.g., Bi 2 Te 3 [ 16 ] or PbTe.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It is an integral (Fock) operator for hybrids but a differential operator [citation 31] for meta-GGAs, the same operator for occupied and unoccupied one-electron states.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: More realistic band gaps from meta-generalized gradient approximations: Only in a generalized Kohn-Sham scheme \nAbstract: Unlike the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), calculations with meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGA) are usually done according to the generalized Kohn-Sham (gKS) formalism. The exchange-correlation potential of the gKS equation is nonmultiplicative, which prevents systematic comparison of meta-GGA band structures to those of the LDA and the GGA. We implement the optimized effective potential (OEP) of the meta-GGA for periodic systems, which allows us to carry out meta-GGA calculations in the same KS manner as for the LDA and the GGA. We apply the OEP to several meta-GGAs, including the new SCAN functional [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)]. We find that the KS gaps and KS band structures of meta-GGAs are close to those of GGAs. They are smaller than the more realistic gKS gaps of meta-GGAs, but probably close to the less-realistic gaps in the band structure of the exact KS potential, as can be seen by comparing with the gaps of the EXX+ RPA OEP potential. The well-known grid sensitivity of meta-GGAs is much more severe in OEP calculations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(4) Eq. (  4 ) can be partitioned into a GGA-like part and a \u03c4 -dependent part: v XC,\u03c3 (r) = v GGA XC,\u03c3 (r) + v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 (r). ( 5 ) v GGA XC,\u03c3 is a multiplicative potential, but v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 does not have a closed form. v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 can be written as v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 (r) = 1 \u2126 BZ i BZ d 3 k V cell d 3 r \u2032 d 3 r \u2032\u2032 \u2202e XC \u2202\u03c4 \u03c3 (r \u2032 ) \u00d7 \u03b4\u03c4 \u03c3 (r \u2032 ) \u03b4\u03c8 ik\u03c3 (r \u2032\u2032 ) \u03b4\u03c8 ik\u03c3 (r \u2032\u2032 ) \u03b4n \u03c3 (r) + c.c. . (6) On one hand, the gKS meta-GGA potential operator is obtained by multiplying both side of Eq.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe third rung of the Jacob's ladder, the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA), is commonly implemented in the gKS scheme according to the method of Neumann, Nobes and Handy (also denoted as gKS in this paper)  10  . The gKS meta-GGA band gap of periodic systems improves  11  over the KS GGA gaps as expected. In this work we find that, with the recently proposed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional  12, 13  , the gKS meta-GGA gap corrects about 20%\u223c50% of the difference between the experimental fundamental gap and the GGA KS gap. Due to the restriction in the functional form of GGA, a GGA cannot perform well for finite systems and periodic systems at the same time. 14 On the other hand, the functional form of meta-GGA can satisfy more exact conditions and has a wider range of applicability than the GGA form. The SCAN functional is a non-empirical functional that satisfies all known exact constraints appropriate to a semilocal functional, and is expected to perform well for systems with very different kinds of bonds.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe computational accuracies of the SCAN functional for many properties improve over those of the GGAs, with only marginal increase of computational cost.  12  We find that SCAN also improves band gaps, but the comparsion is between meta-GGA gKS gaps and GGA KS gaps, which are not the same quantity. It is unclear whether the KS gap itself is improved, or just the gKS gap is improved. One needs to do meta-GGA calculations in the KS scheme to be able to have a systematic comparsion of the KS band gaps between meta-GGA and GGA. In the gKS formalism for an orbital functional such as a meta-GGA or hybrid functional, we find the \"optimal variational potential\", a non-multiplicative self-adjoint operator that minimizes the energy functional with respect to the orbitals. This potential is a differential operator for a meta-GGA and an integral operator for a hybrid functional. In the KS formalism for an orbital functional, we find the optimized effective potential (OEP)  15, 16  , the multiplicative xc potential that minimizes the energy.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The aim of our study was to assess the functional state of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling in patients with MS. Tr1 cells were induced in vitro by activation with anti-CD46 antibodies in controls and patients with MS. Cells were phenotyped by cytometry and suppression assays, and the expression of cytokines and transcription factors was evaluated by real-time PCR, ELISA, cytometry and Western blotting. We found that the activity of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling is impaired in MS patients since Tr1 cells isolated from MS patients produced less IL-10 than those obtained from controls. Indeed, the supernatants from Tr1 cells from controls did not suppress the proliferation of stimulated CD4(+) cells from patients with MS. Furthermore, the IL-10R signaling pathway was not fully active in CD4(+) cells from MS patients and these cells had higher baseline levels of SOCS3 transcripts than controls. Indeed, after in vitro IL-10 stimulation, the expression levels of the STAT1, STAT3 and IL-10RA genes were higher in MS patients than in controls. Moreover, Stat-3 phosphorylation was lower in controls than in patients after IL-10 stimulation. These results indicate that IL-10 regulatory function is impaired in patients with MS. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1F ; p <0.001). This suppression was impaired in the presence of the anti-IL-10 antibody, confirming that the suppression was mediated by IL-10 (Fig.  1F ). Thus, in accordance with earlier data  [14] , we confirm that CD46 stimulation of CD4 + cells induces a Tr1-like phenotype and that this phenotype is stable in culture for 20 days, although IL-10 production is dependent on further TCR stimulation. When the same CD46-induced Tr1 induction protocol was applied to CD4 + cells from untreated patients with MS (n = 11), we found that there was a similar increase in the expression of the CD25 and CD45RO activation and memory markers, as well as in intracellular and secreted IFN-c (Fig.  2A, B ). However, both the intracellular and secreted levels of IL-10 produced by Tr1 cells from MS patients were significantly lower at day 3 than those from HC (Fig.  2A, C ; p <0.05 in both cases).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRecently, Astier et al.  [21]  demonstrated that Tr1 function is also impaired in patients with MS. Moreover, the expression of the immunosuppressor cytokine IL-10 is diminished in MS patients  [22, 23] , in accordance with previous studies describing fewer IL-10-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Interestingly, there is a reduction in the expression of IL-10 but elevated numbers of PBMC expressing IL-10 transcripts before clinical relapse in MS  [24] , and there is a correlation between IL-10 levels and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients  [25] . Engineered Th2/Tr1 cells that produce high levels of IL-10 prevent epitope spreading and ameliorate the disease course in animal models of MS  [26] . However, it is unknown whether the functional activity of IL-10 in MS is preserved, and attempts to treat MS patients with IL-10 have not been successful to date.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNevertheless, in order to unravel the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions, we must still better understand how Treg cells function in autoimmune disease, particularly since Treg cell transfer might be exploited as a tool in immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases  [5] . Tr1 cells are defined by their ability to produce high levels of IL-10, moderate amounts of TGF-b and IFN-c, and no IL-2 or IL-4. In addition, they also have a poor proliferative capacity  [6, 7] . Moreover, Tr1 cells display a memory phenotype, and they can suppress naive and memory Th1 or Th2 responses through the production of IL-10. The suppressive effects of Tr1 cells differentiated in vitro are remarkably potent, and fewer than 4000 Tr1 cells are capable of suppressing the proliferation of 50 000 CD4 + T cells by 50%  [8] . Tr1 cells participate in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by suppressing the activation of autoreactive T cells  [9, 10] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-I) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered IFN-\u03b2 are partly mediated by AhR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AhR agonists that act on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AhR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe microbial flora and its products have been shown to control T cell-dependent inflammation through several mechanisms including the conversion of precursors provided by the diet into immune regulatory metabolites  [13] [14] [15]  . However, less is known about the effects of the diet and microbial products on the inflammatory response of resident cells in the CNS. Here we identify an IFN-I and AhR axis that integrates immunologic, metabolic and environmental cues to regulate astrocyte activity and CNS inflammation.\n\nResults\n\n\nAstrocytes show a transcriptional response to IFN-I during EAE\nTo study the regulation of astrocyte function during autoimmune CNS inflammation, we induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG 35-55 ) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and analyzed mRNA expression in astrocytes by RNA-sequencing (Supplementary Figs.  1a, b ). We detected 17,964 expressed genes (Fig.  1a ), and found 1,879 transcripts that were differentially regulated in astrocytes during EAE compared to astrocytes from naive mice (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, our results identify a molecular pathway through which the diet in cooperation with the commensal flora modulate the activity of CNS resident cells and neuroinflammation. In addition, the regulation of AhR expression by IFN-\u03b2 suggest that the microbiome may affect not only the development of CNS autoimmunity, but also its response to disease modifying therapies  60  .

These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.\nAstrocytes are the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system (CNS).

Experimental immunization with sporozoites induces this type of protective response, but the extremely large number of proteins expressed by Plasmodium parasites has so far prohibited the identification of sufficient discrete T-cell antigens to develop subunit vaccines that produce sterile immunity. Here, using mice singly immunized with Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites and high-throughput screening, we identified a unique CTL response against the parasite ribosomal L3 protein. Unlike CTL responses to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the population of L3-specific CTLs was not expanded by multiple sporozoite immunizations. CSP is abundant in the sporozoite itself, whereas L3 expression does not increase until the liver stage. The response induced by a single immunization with sporozoites reduces the parasite load in the liver so greatly during subsequent immunizations that L3-specific responses are only generated during the primary exposure. Functional L3-specific CTLs can, however, be expanded by heterologous prime-boost regimens. Thus, although repeat sporozoite immunization expands responses to preformed antigens like CSP that are present in the sporozoite itself, this immunization strategy may not expand CTLs targeting parasite proteins that are synthesized later. Heterologous strategies may be needed to increase CTL responses across the entire spectrum of Plasmodium liver-stage proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSimilar to the behavior of CSP-specific cells following multiple sporozoite immunizations, these heterologous prime-boost approaches expanded the population of activated (CD11a HI CD62L LO CD44 HI ) L3-specific T cells by 0.74 or 1.67 log 10 cells per spleen for L3 peptide-pulsed DC or GAP priming, respectively, compared with the appropriately matched Lm-L3 priming immunization alone (Fig.  4  F and G). Thus, in contrast to multiple sporozoite immunizations, a heterologous prime-boost approach expanded the L3-specific population and maintained its activated phenotype.\n\nPrior Sporozoite Immunization Eliminates L3 Expression and Liver Stage Parasite Development and Prevents the Boosting of Responses Against\nLate Liver Stage Antigens. Heterologous prime-boost studies presented above suggested that functional memory L3 CTLs were formed by priming with sporozoites.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt would be desirable to identify such proteins because they could be combined with CSP to produce multicomponent subunit vaccines capable of acting at multiple checkpoints throughout parasite liverstage development. However, in retrospect it appears that multiple homologous sporozoite immunizations may have hamstrung screening efforts by biasing immune responses in favor of preformed antigens like CSP. Because of this effect, efforts that screen multiply-immunized mice with late liver-stage antigen libraries could be destined to fail. Although the L3 antigen identified herein does not appear to be protective alone, L3-specific T-cell responses were boosted by using heterologous prime-boost immunization regimens. The lack of L3 boosting by repeated sporozoite exposures may be emblematic of a phenomenon affecting other liver-stage parasite antigens as well. Heterologous prime-boost approaches are being used for malaria vaccination-challenge studies in mice and humans  (49) . Our findings make the case for heterologous approaches at the antigen discovery phase as well. By inducing a broad immune repertoire, we may be able to generate responses capable of eradicating all malariainfected hepatocytes, including those missed by CSP-or other sporozoite-limited responses.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo explain the lack of L3 CTL boosting in response to subsequent sporozoite immunizations, we hypothesized that L3 antigen was insufficiently presented during secondary or later sporozoite immunizations because the developing adaptive immune response constrained the parasite such that L3 expression was suppressed during later immunizations. To test this hypothesis, we immunized mice one to three times with 2 \u00d7 10 4 P. yoelii GAP at 1-or 3-wk intervals. Unimmunized mice and mice 44 h after the last immunization were killed and total RNA was extracted from livers to evaluate parasite abundance and transcript expression. Regardless of the interval between immunizations (1 or 3 wk), prior sporozoite immunization reduced the liver parasite burden >1,000-fold compared with the first exposure (Fig.  5A  and Table  1 ).

Here, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy study of gate-tunable tBLG devices supported by atomically smooth and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (BN). The high quality of these tBLG devices allows identification of coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns and moir\u00e9 super-superlattices produced by graphene-graphene and graphene-BN interlayer interactions. Furthermore, we examine additional tBLG spectroscopic features in the local density of states beyond the first van Hove singularity. Our experimental data are explained by a theory of moir\u00e9 bands that incorporates ab initio calculations and confirms the strongly nonperturbative character of tBLG interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2(c )). Each AA region displays internal honeycomb-like structure, while the AB/BA regions display internal triangular-like lattice structures with opposite orientations (consistent with expected tBLG structure  [13, [33] [34] [35] [36] ). The local electronic structure of tBLG/BN in the 15\u00b0 regime was measured by performing STM dI/dV spectroscopy in areas having different moir\u00e9 wavelength (see Supplementary Material for spectroscopy in areas with 15\u00b0). Figure  3  shows dI/dV spectra obtained in the AA regions of different moir\u00e9 patterns (spectra obtained in AB/BA and bridge moir\u00e9 regions are quite similar; see the Supplementary Material). All of the spectra in Fig.  3  were taken while holding the Dirac point close to (but not exactly at) the Fermi level via application of a gate voltage (V g ). The Dirac point feature is not clearly visible in these spectra because of a ~130 meV wide gap-like feature at the Fermi level that is caused by phonon-assisted inelastic tunneling (similar to the case for monolayer graphene  [37] ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOur spectra exhibit a peak and two dips (labeled by colored arrows) that disperse with moir\u00e9 wavelength. The peak (black arrows) corresponds to the VHS previously reported by STS and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy  [2, 9, 22] , the 1st dip (red arrows) is a minima that follows the VHS, while the 2nd dip (green arrows) is a phenomenon not present in previous studies of tBLG on graphite or silicon carbide substrates  [2, 9] . The energy magnitudes of these features (relative to the Dirac point) decrease as the moir\u00e9 wavelength increases, and each feature has a symmetric copy lying on the opposite side of the Dirac point.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAlthough coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns have previously been observed in graphitic multilayers  [9, 10] , we demonstrate here that moir\u00e9 patterns produced by graphene-graphene interlayer interactions can coincide with moir\u00e9 patterns that arise from graphene-BN interactions to produce a new supersuperlattice structure. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of tBLG/BN yield new insight into how the intrinsic electronic behavior of tBLG is affected by moir\u00e9-induced interactions. For example, we observe an additional dip feature in the DOS at an energy beyond the first VHS. By comparing the moir\u00e9 wavelength dependence of this new feature's energy to calculations incorporating ab initio results, we find that it arises from a partial gap opening between the second and third moir\u00e9 bands due to strong non-perturbative interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. These measurements on our high quality tBLG/BN samples provide a first look into the atomic-scale behavior of electrostatically gated tBLG, an important device configuration for future applications  [28, 29] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Our most detailed studies are with CCl 4 , where spectral absorption of the incident IR beam is minimized.   18 . All of the organic/water interfaces studied have been found to be highly sensitive to trace impurities that tend to concentrate at the interface and can cause the spectrum to appear more like that of the air/ water system (Fig.  1C ). This effect can readily account for the differences between our observations and previous CCl We demonstrate controlled rotation of optically trapped objects in a spiral interference pattern. This pattern is generated by interfering an annular shaped laser beam with a reference beam. Objects are trapped in the spiral arms of the pattern. Changing the optical path length causes this pattern, and thus the trapped objects, to rotate. Structures of silica microspheres, microscopic glass rods, and chromosomes are set into rotation at rates in excess of 5 hertz.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, interactions between these water molecules and the organic phase result in substantial orientation of these weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the interfacial region. The results have important implications for understanding water adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces and the penetration of water into hydrophobic phases. Protein folding, membrane formation, micellar assembly, and wetting are a few of the many processes in which the interaction of water with hydrophobic fluid surfaces plays an important role. A driving force behind these processes is an uncommonly large entropy loss, which is usually explained as an enhanced structuring of water in the immediate vicinity of apolar molecules, biological macromolecules, and hydrophobic surfaces. Experimental measurements that provide a molecular-level view of interfacial water structure and hydrogen bonding at these interfaces have proven to be problematic because of the difficulty in selectively examining interfacial water molecules. Hence, most of our understanding of the molecular structure of water at hydrophobic surfaces comes from theory (1-7).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3%) of 1,505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSince other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion  [4] , several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1,505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.\n\nBackground\nZIKAV, an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus  [5] , was first isolated in 1947 from a monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda  [6] . Sporadic human Zika fever cases have been reported since the 1960s  [7] . The first documented outbreak outside Africa and Asia occurred in 2007 in the Yap State, Micronesia, in the North Pacific, where Zika fever was characterised by rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia  [8] . ZIKAV has been isolated from several Aedes mosquito species, notably including Ae. aegypti  [9]  and Ae.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections. Arbovirus transfusionderived transmission has been reported principally for WNV  [19] , DENV  [20]  and chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  [21, 22] . For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high  [21, 22] . During the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007)  [21]  and in R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-07)  [22] , blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia. Due to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR  [16] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOf the 34 inoculated, three were positive in culture. However, the culture was conducted retrospectively and sample storage conditions were not optimal for viral culture (several freeze /thaw cycles), leading potentially to some false-negative results.\n\nOccurrence of Zika fever-like syndrome following blood donation\nBlood donors positive for ZIKAV were contacted retrospectively by telephone to investigate the occurrence of 'Zika fever-like syndrome' (rash and /or conjunctivitis and/or arthralgia) after their blood donation. Of the 42 donors tested positive by RT-PCR, 11 declared that they had a Zika fever -like syndrome from 3 to 10 days after they gave blood.\n\nDiscussion\nThe main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75% for DENV  [17]  and West Nile virus (WNV)  [18] . For ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

How caspase-11 executes these downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 maturation. A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, Gsdmd(-/-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Gram-negative bacteria. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n6b, c ). In addition, Casp11 2/2 BMDMs co-cultured with Il1b 2/2 BMDMs did not secrete IL-1b in response to cytoplasmic LPS (Fig.  4b  and Extended Data Fig.  6d ), making it unlikely that a paracrine signalling mechanism activates the NLRP3 inflammasome  30  . Collectively, our data demonstrate that Gsdmd maturation by caspase-11 triggers two distinct cell-intrinsic signals: Pam3CSK4 priming (i) pyroptosis induction; and (ii) NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation (Fig.  4c ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDiscussion\nPyroptosis plays an important role in anti-bacterial innate immune defence and lethal endotoxemia 1,  37, 38  , but how inflammatory caspases 1, 4, 5 and 11 cause pyroptosis has remained unknown. Our data reveal that proteolytic cleavage of Gsdmd by mouse caspase-11 or human caspase-4 is essential for pyroptosis of innate immune cells and endothelial cells harbouring LPS-tainted cytoplasm. Cleaved Gsdmd also triggers NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 through a cell-intrinsic pathway (Fig.  4c ), although the exact mechanism responsible for NLRP3 activation remains unclear. NLRP3 senses diverse stimuli that perturb intracellular homeostasis 6,  19, 21, 22  , so its activation may be an indirect consequence of the effects of the Gsdmd p30 fragment. Future studies will need to address exactly what the p30 fragment does in cells. The redefined non-canonical inflammasome signalling pathway (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nLoss of NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1 in BMDMs did not markedly affect caspase-11-dependent generation of mature Gsdmd p30 in response to cytoplasmic LPS (Fig.  4a ), indicating that Gsdmd cleavage occurs upstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The question arises as to whether Gsdmd induces pyroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation simultaneously in the same cell, or if Gsdmd-mediated pyroptosis releases damage-associated molecular patterns  29  that trigger caspase-11-independent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neighbouring cells (Extended Data Fig.  6a ). We believe the latter hypothesis is unlikely because LPS-stimulated Il1b 2/2 BMDMs exhibited normal pyroptosis, yet their culture supernatant failed to induce IL-1b secretion from Casp11 2/2 BMDMs (Extended Data Fig.  6b, c ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We investigated the actions of Nec-1 and its so-called inactive analog, Nec-1i, in the setting of myocardial I/R injury.\nMaterials and methods: The actions of Nec-1 and Nec-1i were examined in cultured C2C12 and H9c2 myocytes, cardiomyocytes isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats, Langendorff isolated perfused C57Bl/6J mouse hearts and an in vivo open-chest C57Bl/6J mouse heart model.\nResults: Nec-1 at 30 microM and 100 microM (but not 100 microM Nec-1i) reduced peroxide-induced cell death in C2C12 cells from 51.2 +/- 1.1% (control) to 26.3 +/- 2.9% (p < 0.01 vs control) and 17.8 +/- 0.9% (p < 0.001), respectively. With H9c2 cells cell death was also reduced from 73.0 +/- 0.4% (control) to 56.7 +/- 0% (30 microM Nec-1, p < 0.05) and 45.4 +/- 3.3% (100 microM Nec-1, p < 0.01). In the isolated perfused heart Nec-1 (30 microM) reduced infarct size (calculated as a percentage of the risk area) from 48.0 +/- 2.0% (control) to 32.1 +/- 5.4% (p < 0.05). Nec-1i (30 microM) also reduced infarct size (32.9 +/- 5.1%, p < 0.05). In anesthetized C57Bl/6J mice Nec-1 (1.65 mg/kg), given intraperitoneally to coincide with reperfusion following left anterior descending artery ligation (30 min), also reduced infarct size from 45.3 +/- 5.1% (control) to 26.6 +/- 4.0% (p < 0.05), whilst Nec-1i (1.74 mg/kg) was ineffective (37.8 +/- 6.0%). Stimulus-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in rat cardiomyocytes, as reflected by the time until mitochondrial depolarisation, was unaffected by Nec-1 or Nec-1i at 30 muM but increased at 100 muM i.e. 91% (p < 0.05 vs control) and 152% (p < 0.001) for Nec-1 and Nec-1i, respectively.\nConclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that necrostatins inhibit myocardial cell death and reduce infarct size, possibly via a mechanism independent of the MPTP. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAn examination of the effects of necrostatins on cell signaling pathways involved in cardioprotection will aid in the characterisation of these agents  [4] . The advent of newer and possibly more potent forms of the necrostatins will also assist in this process  [22] . In conclusion, as discussed by Degterev et al.  [12]  necrosis and apoptosis play key roles in a variety of pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction, and the identification of compounds such as the necrostatins which may target the proposed alternative death pathway, necroptosis, may lead to the development of more effective therapies. Our data are the first to indicate that necrostatin is protective against I/R injury in the myocardium, possibly via mechanisms other than those that are generally accepted as being involved (i.e. apoptosis and necrosis)  [23] . It should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1  for chemical structures of Nec-1 and Nec-1i). The same authors claimed that Nec-1 produced its actions via inhibition of a form of cell death distinct from necrosis and apoptosis which they termed necroptosis  [12] . More recently sitosterol-induced death in macrophages was reported to be caspaseindependent and blocked by Nec-1, and again it was suggested that necroptosis (and autophagy) might be involved  [13] , although considerably more work will be required before necroptosis can be unequivocally confirmed as representing a distinct entity. Protection against I/R injury in the heart and the brain could involve similar mechanisms and this could extend to the particular cell-signaling pathways or enzymes that are activated or down-regulated during the recovery process  [14] . As Nec-1 has been shown to limit cellular damage in the brain we decided to ascertain whether it could produce a similar action in the myocardium. To investigate this we used a variety of in vitro experimental models.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies. Thus, we intend to carry out further, more probing investigations, including in human tissue,  (1)  to obtain information regarding the therapeutic window for necrostatins, (2) to establish if necroptosis is, indeed, a feature of the degenerative changes occurring in myocardial infarction, (3) to determine the significance of necroptosis in relation to the other forms of cell death that occur in MI, and, (4) to elucidate potential cellular mechanisms underlying such a process in the myocardium.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Evidence was obtained for different sites of binding of different antibodies and direct correspondence was observed between these sites and the locations of antigenic sites A, B, and E defined by determining the amino acids recognized by the specific antibodies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDISCUSSION\nThese results directly demonstrate the sites of binding of four monoclonal antibodies of different specificities to the X-31 BHA. That the sites are different in detail for the different antibodies may be deduced from the observations that the angles formed between Fab regions and the BHA are constant and different for each antibody. The observation that these angles are constant irrespective of the type of complex observed, 1 + 1, 1 + 2,2 + 2, RHAantibody, etc., is allowed by the axial-rotation and flexing properties of the switch and hinge regions of the antibody molecules  (Wrigley et ab, 1983) . Differences in the sites of antibody binding on the BHA can also be observed directly even at this level of resolution (probably about 2 nm). For example HC45 clearly binds at a site away from an end of the BHA molecule whereas HC31 binds squarely on an end. This location of the HC31 antibody-binding site is supported by the observation of restricted complex formation. Only 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 BHAantibody complexes were seen (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe amino acids recognized have generally been assumed to contribute to the particular antibody binding site. We present here evidence obtained directly by electron microscopy of haemagglutinin-antibody complexes that this is the case for ant.i-\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nHaemagglutinin\npreparation Soluble preparations of the haemagglutinin (BHA) from X-31 (H3N2)  (Kilbourne, 1969)  were made by bromelain digestion of purified virus particles as described by  Brand and Skehel (1972) . Monoclonal antibody preparation. Balb/ c mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of 8000 HA units of purified virus. Eight weeks later they received 32,000 BHA units of virus intraperitoneally and intravenously. Three days later their spleens were removed and the cells fused with SP2/ 0-Ag14 myeloma cells  (Shulman et d, 1978)  as described by  Kohler and Milstein (1975, 1976) . Hybrid cell culture conditions were based on those described by Fazekas de St.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3 ) presumably because of the binding of a second antibody to an unoccupied equivalent region of the BHA trimer is sterically prevented by the first antibody bound. The sites of antibody binding and the locations of amino acid substitutions in the BIIAs of antigenie variants can also be considered in relation to the thxee-dimensional structure of the BHA, Fig.  6 . These considerations indicate that the sites of amino acid substitution are in all four cases appropriately located to be involved directly in the antibody-binding sites. In the case of HC31 they also indicate the basis of the steric inhibition of the binding of a second antibody to the BHA. Since the three 198 residues recognized are only 15 A apart around the threefold axis of the trimer, the BHA is effectively monovalent at this site. The results therefore substantiate the positions of antigenic sites A, B, and E and in the ease of site B give an indication of the extent of this region at the distal tip of the BHA molecule. It would also be of interest to examine antibodies specific for sites C and D but we have not characterized antibodies prepared against X-31 virus which recognize amino acids in these sites.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We consider alternatives to ETH that have been proposed. We first show that von Neumann's quantum ergodic theorem relies on an assumption that is essentially equivalent to ETH. We also investigate whether, following a sudden quench, special classes of pure states can lead to thermal behavior in systems that do not obey ETH, namely, integrable systems. We find examples of this, but only for initial states that obeyed ETH before the quench. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis dephasing mechanism accounts for the approach to thermal equilibrium for an initially out-of-equilibrium state  [2, 5] . The Quantum Ergodic Theorem: In 1929, von Neumann proved a mathematical result which has been dubbed the quantum ergodic theorem (QET)  [11] . An exegesis of it has been given by Goldstein et al. (hereafter GLTZ)  [12] . GLTZ summarize QET, or \"normal typicallity\" as it has been more recently known, as follows: \"for a typical finite family of commuting macroscopic observables, every initial wave function from a micro-canonical energy shell so evolves that for most times \u03c4 in the long run, the joint probability distribution of these observables obtained from |\u03c8(\u03c4 ) is close to their microcanonical distribution\"  [12] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs already noted, ETH can be justified by various results from quantum chaos theory. Thus, ETH provides a physical basis for the technical condition needed by QET. This results in a unification of two formerly disparate schools of thought on the foundations of statistical mechanics. Quantum Quenches: As mentioned in the introduction, ETH has been shown to be satisfied in a variety of nonintegrable quantum systems. It has been found to breakdown only as one approaches integrable points  [6] [7] [8] , or in special regimes that are dominated by finite size effects, e.g., close to the atomic limit  [14, 15] . Thermalization itself has been shown to be robust in nonintegrable systems after a (sudden) quench, once again, failing to occur close to integrable points  [6, 16, 17]  or the atomic limit  [15, 18] , and in localized disordered systems  [19] . Here, by (sudden) quench, we mean that the system is prepared in an eigenstate of some initial Hamiltonian (not necessarily the ground state) and then at \u03c4 = 0 the Hamiltonian is changed.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction and Summary of ETH: Consider an isolated quantum N -body system with hamiltonian \u0124. Let |\u03b1 denote an eigenstate of \u0124 with eigenvalue E \u03b1 , and let \u00c2 denote a few-body observable. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) states that (1) the diagonal matrix elements A \u03b1\u03b1 = \u03b1| \u00c2|\u03b1 change slowly with the state, with the difference between neighboring values A \u03b1+1,\u03b1+1 -A \u03b1\u03b1 exponentially small in N , and (2) that the off-diagonal matrix elements A \u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b1| \u00c2|\u03b2 , \u03b1 = \u03b2, are themselves exponentially small in N \n[1, 2] .

Most recently, the first active specific immunotherapeutic approach, a cancer vaccine, has passed the final phase of human testing and its approval by the FDA is pending. However, evidence suggests that the full protective and therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines has not yet been achieved. Through multiple mechanisms, tumors promote conditions in the tumor-bearing host that mitigate or even eliminate the vaccine-induced antitumor response. Restoration of the impaired immune function is, therefore, imperative for achieving optimum vaccine efficacy. Targeted pharmacological interventions are capable of overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, and thereby enable cancer vaccination to reach its full therapeutic potential. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n65  In this regard, the competitive IDO inhibitor 1methyltryptophan (1MT) significantly delays Figure  2  | elevated numbers of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer. Tumor cells, for example renal cell carcinoma, secrete a variety of bioactive products that stimulate mobilization of immature myeloid cells from bone marrow into the peripheral blood. These cells are profoundly immunosuppressive and support tumor growth via inhibition of adaptive immune responses. By contrast, the proportion of T H 1-biased dendritic cells and their immediate precursors are reduced in patients with cancer. Both the secreted products and myeloid cells are candidates for targeted therapies to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccines (red text). Finally, many tumor-recruited myeloid cells migrate into tumor tissues where they support tumor growth via local immunosuppression and stimulation of neoangiogenesis (see Figure  3 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMDSCs can be divided into two major cate gories, namely CD33 + CD11b + myelomonocytic cells  [18] [19] [20]  and CD15 + CD11b + CD14 -granulocytetype cells.  [20] [21] [22]  Both these cell types are profoundly immunosuppressive and represent independent lineages that arise from myeloid precursor cells. A typical hallmark of MDSCs is the overexpression of arginase 1, a key enzyme in the inhibi tion of Tcell responses.  23, 24  Moreover, oxidative stress and secretion of nitric oxide (NO) by MDSCs contribute to the hostile, immunosuppressive tumor micro environment by attenuating Tcell function.  [25] [26] [27] [28]  MDSCs are frequently detected in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic RCC  18, 19, 21, 29  or bladder carcinoma (e. eruslanov, personal communication). Moreover, MDSC frequencies seem to correlate with the stage of the disease, and potentially provide an important biomarker of prognosis.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n25  Several mol ecules and mechanisms can modulate tumormediated recruitment of BMDCs, including veGF receptors and chemokine CXCL12-CXCR4mediated pathways.  17, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77]  Overexpression of veGF promotes mobilization of veGFR1 + CXCR4 + BMDCs into the peripheral blood, and thus promotes immuno suppression. Tumorderived veGF also inhibits differentiation of DCs and promotes accumulation of MDSCs in the tumorbearing host.  [78] [79] [80]  Importantly, a considerable interplay seems to exist between the CXCR4 and veGFR1 pathways as both receptors are highly upregulated under conditions of hypoxia or oxidative stress.  26, 81  Targeting the veGF-veGFR and stromal cellderived factor 1 (SDF1)-CXCR4 axes, therefore, is a promising approach for immunomodulatory cancer therapy.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It is well known that in these processes cell movements can be guided by gradients of various chemical signals. In this study, we demonstrate that cell movement can also be guided by purely physical interactions at the cell-substrate interface. We cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 fibroblasts on flexible polyacrylamide sheets coated with type I collagen. A transition in rigidity was introduced in the central region of the sheet by a discontinuity in the concentration of the bis-acrylamide cross-linker. Cells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate \"durotaxis.\" In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFrom these observations, one may predict that cells are capable of responding to substrate rigidity through a true active tactile exploration process, by exerting contractile forces and then interpreting the substrate deformation to determine a preferred direction or destination of their movements  (Pelham and Wang, 1997; Sheetz et al., 1998) . Our approach to testing this hypothesis consists of putting motile National Institutes of Health 3T3 cells on collagencoated polyacrylamide substrates with a rigidity gradient, under conditions such that the only way the cells can detect this stiffness gradient is by a process of active tactile exploration. Our results indicate that 3T3 fibroblasts can in-deed detect and respond to substrate stiffness. Furthermore, the cell consistently migrates in the direction of increasing stiffness. To confirm the involvement of a force-sensing mechanism, we have also shown that the direction of cell movement can be guided by manipulating mechanical strain within the flexible substrate. The observed coupling between strain and movement is exactly as required to produce a preference for hard materials. Parallel measurements indicate that cells generate stronger traction forces and spread to a larger size on stiff substrates than on soft substrates.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe cells responded by increasing the resistive forces and/or reinforcing the integrin-cytoskeleton linkages  (Wang et al., 1993; Choquet et al., 1997) . Based on these observations,  Sheetz et al. (1998)  speculated that stiffness of the ECM might function as an environmental cue to orient the direction of cell movement. Our observation that 3T3 cells are able to probe the rigidity of the substrates and regulate their traction forces and movement represents a direct demonstration of this guidance mechanism in action. It is unclear how cells actually translate substrate rigidity into downstream responses. One possibility is that cells can directly sense the distance of receptor movement as a result of exerted probing forces. Alternatively, the rigidity of the substrate could be determined by monitoring the magnitude of counterforces upon the consumption of a given amount of FIGURE 5 Model for the detection of substrate rigidity. We assume that initial probing forces are generated by actin-myosin interactions associated with cell-substrate adhesion sites. (a) On soft substrates, the receptorligand complex is mobile and the tension at the anchorage site is weak.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition to substrate rigidity, we have demonstrated that mechanical input generated by substrate deformation also regulates the formation and retraction of lamellipodia. This is to be expected in an active sensing system, because the force/deformation caused by the external manipulation will be superimposed on the effects of the cellular probing forces. In all cases cells responded with the formation/ expansion of lamellipodia when the substratum was locally pulled outward from the center, and with retraction when the substratum was pushed inward. Because fibroblasts ex- ert centripetal forces on the substrate  (Dembo and Wang 1999) , pulling the flexible substrate away from the cell center means that cell-generated forces produce less substrate motion, which may then be interpreted by the cell as being equivalent to a stiffer substrate. Conversely, pushing the substrate toward the cell center should increase the effective substrate motion, which is thereby interpreted by the cell as softening of the substrate. Thus these results confirm and extend our conclusion based on the gradient of stiffness. It is worth noting that rigidity-guided movement (durotaxis) takes place only when there are no other cells in the vicinity.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The aim of this study was thus to test the hypothesis that core members of the mammalian Hippo pathway are expressed in skeletal muscle and that the transcriptional co-factor Yap, a core member of the Hippo pathway, regulates C2C12 myogenesis. We found that the major components of the mammalian Hippo pathway including Yap are all expressed in skeletal muscles, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. In C2C12 myoblasts, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low and Yap localises to nuclei. Upon differentiation, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increases approximately 20-fold and Yap translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol. To test whether the observed increase of Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is required for differentiation we overexpressed hYAP1 S127A, a mutant that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127, in C2C12 myoblasts. We found that overexpression of hYAP S127A prevented myotube formation, whereas the overexpression of wildtype hYAP1 or empty vector had no effect. In addition, more hYAP1 S127A overexpressing cells progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle and the expression of MRFs (myogenin, Myf5), Mef2c and cell cycle regulators (p21, cyclin D1) was significantly changed when compared to wildtype hYAP1 and empty vector overexpressing cells. This data suggests that the phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 leads to a changed expression of MRFs and cell cycle regulators and is required for C2C12 myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe first monitored the localisation and phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 during myogenesis for which we used the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line as an in vitro model (Fig.  2 ). During C2C12 myogenesis, myoblasts first proliferate to confluency, withdraw from the cell cycle and then differentiate into myotubes upon a shift to differentiation medium containing lower concentrations of mitogens. We found that Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low in myoblasts but after 24 h in differentiation medium Ser127 phosphorylation is %20-fold increased and after 96 h it is %28-fold higher than in myoblasts, respectively (Fig.  2A , see also Fig.  S1a  in the Supplementary data for a quantification). Changes in the phosphorylation of Yap during differentiation are accompanied by the gradual translocation of Yap from distinct loci in the nucleus of myoblasts to the cytoplasm of myotubes (Fig.  2B ; see Fig.  S2b  in the Supplementary data for additional images).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs Yap has previously been reported to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation of neural  [16]  and intestine progenitors  [15]  we decided to study Yap during C2C12 myogenesis in order to test whether it had a similar function in skeletal muscle. At the onset of C2C12 differentiation Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increased %20-fold and Yap increasingly translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol (Fig.  2 ). The likely mechanism is that the Yap Ser127 residue is phosphorylated by Lats1/2  [10, 14, 19]  and that Ser127 phosphorylated Yap is then sequestered by 14-3-3 binding proteins in the cytosol  [11] [12] [13] . Our data suggest that Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is an essential differentiation event because the overexpression of a hYAP1 S127A mutant, which can not be phosphorylated at residue 127, prevents myotube formation and the expression of late differentiation markers (Fig.  3  and Fig.  S2  in Supplementary data).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2B ; see Fig.  S2b  in the Supplementary data for additional images). To test whether the observed increase of Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is required for C2C12 differentiation we overexpressed hYAP1 S127A in C2C12 myoblasts and induced differentiation by a change to differentiation medium. The hYAP1 S127A mutant can not be phosphorylated at residue Ser127 allowing us to increase the concentration of unphosphorylated Yap at a time when Ser127 phosphorylation of endogenous Yap would normally be increased %20-fold or more and when the concentration of unphosphorylated Yap would consequently be decreased. Fig.  3  shows that cells transfected with wildtype hYAP1 and empty vector differentiate as normal, forming multinucleated myotubes that are positive for myosin heavy chain. In contrast, hYAP1 S127A overexpressing cells do not form myotubes and are negative for myosin heavy chain (Fig.  3A  and C ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To identify genes governing endolysosomal dynamics, we conducted a global fluorescence-based screen to reveal endomembrane effector genes. Screening implicated Phox (PX) domain\u2013containing protein Mdm1 in endomembrane dynamics. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that Mdm1 is a novel interorganelle tethering protein that localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013vacuole/lysosome membrane contact sites (MCSs). We show that Mdm1 is ER anchored and contacts the vacuole surface in trans via its lipid-binding PX domain. Strikingly, overexpression of Mdm1 induced ER\u2013vacuole hypertethering, underscoring its role as an interorganelle tether. We also show that Mdm1 and its paralogue Ydr179w-a (named Nvj3 in this study) localize to ER\u2013vacuole MCSs independently of established tether Nvj1. Finally, we find that Mdm1 truncations analogous to neurological disease\u2013associated SNX14 alleles fail to tether the ER and vacuole and perturb sphingolipid metabolism. Our work suggests that human Mdm1 homologues may play previously unappreciated roles in interorganelle communication and lipid metabolism. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition to mitochondria, the ER also forms MCSs with endosomes and lysosomes (vacuoles in yeast;  Pan et al., 2000; Eden et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2013; Rowland et al., 2014) . Indeed, EM studies showed that the ER and endosomes are closely juxtaposed, allowing the ER-resident phosphatase PTP1B to regulate the sorting of EGF receptors at late endosomes in trans  (Eden et al., 2010) . Additionally, the endosomal sterol-binding protein STARD3 has recently been proposed to bind in trans to ER-localized vesicle-associated proteins, thereby localizing sterol transfer to ER-endosome MCSs  (Alpy et al., 2013) . However, the machinery that establishes ER-en-Although endolysosomal trafficking is well defined, how it is regulated and coordinates with cellular metabolism is unclear. To identify genes governing endolysosomal dynamics, we conducted a global fluorescence-based screen to reveal endomembrane effector genes. Screening implicated Phox (PX) domain-containing protein Mdm1 in endomembrane dynamics.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSubsequent light microscopy suggested even the quadruple KO yeast display closely juxtaposed nER and vacuoles (Fig.  S3 C ). However, it should be noted that both the vacuole and nucleus (i.e., nER envelope) are large, so we cannot exclude the possibility that they passively collide even in the absence of tethering machinery. A few studies have implicated the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NVJ in a specific form of microautophagy in which nonessential portions of the nuclear envelope are directly engulfed by the vacuole (PMN;  Roberts et al., 2003; Krick et al., 2008) . To test whether Mdm1 and Nvj3 also participate in PMN, we first defined a condition that induced PMN by monitoring the incorporation of Nvj1-mCherry into NVJ-derived vesicles that bud into the vacuole lumen. Consistent with previous studies, chronic nitrogen depletion successfully induced PMN, leading to the incorporation of Nvj1-mCherry-positive vesicles into the vacuole (Fig.  S2 C ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n4, C-G ). As Nvj1 and Vac8 have no clear homologues in metazoans, Mdm1 family proteins may constitute the first ER-endolysosomal tethers with clear homologues from yeast to man. Given that interorganelle MCSs are implicated in lipid homeostasis, we speculate that the disease-associated Snx14 alleles may perturb ER-endolysosomal interorganelle communication and may additionally perturb aspects of lipid and/or sphingolipid metabolism, contributing to neurological disease. In yeast, the PXA domain is the only domain shared between Mdm1 and Nvj3 and is unique to these proteins, making it specifically localized to ER-vacuole MCSs. This, combined with the observation that an ER-anchored PXA domain is sufficient to induce myriocin hypersensitivity when overexpressed, suggests PXA domains may play a direct role in lipid metabolism through interacting with lipids or ER metabolic proteins. Further studies are needed to reveal the functions of PXA domain-containing proteins in interorganelle communication and lipid metabolism.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

During reperfusion after filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion, ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels increased in ischemic mouse brain. Ischemic injury decreased after intracerebroventricular injections of ICE-like protease inhibitors, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.FMK), acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, or a relatively selective inhibitor of CPP32-like caspases, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, but not a cathepsin B inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone. z-VAD.FMK decreased ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive IL-1\u03b2 levels in ischemic mouse brain and reduced tissue damage when administered to rats as well. Only z-VAD.FMK and acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone reduced brain swelling, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone did not attenuate the ischemia-induced increase in tissue IL-1\u03b2 levels. The three cysteine protease inhibitors significantly improved behavioral deficits, thereby showing that functional recovery of ischemic neuronal tissue can follow blockade of enzymes associated with apoptotic cell death. Finally, we examined the effect of z-VAD.FMK on excitotoxicity and found that it protected against \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-induced or to a lesser extent N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced excitotoxic brain damage.

(41)  with the following minor modification: 0, no observable neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to extend right forepaw (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side (moderate); 3, loss of walking or righting reflex (severe). The rater was naive to the treatment group, and assessments were made at 10 min and 2 hr during ischemia, and again 18 hr after reperfusion. Western Blot Analysis.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNeurotoxicity. Adult male SV-129 mice (20-28 g) were anesthetized with halothane (2.5% for induction, 1-1.5% for maintenance), and the head was fixed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). AMPA (20 mM, 6 nmol) or NMDA (67 mM, 20 nmol) was injected (26-gauge Hamilton syringe) at 0.5 mm anterior and 2 mm lateral to the bregma, and 2.5 mm below the dura in 0.3 l. Rectal temperature was monitored during this 10-min procedure. To assess the effects of ICE-like inhibition, AMPA plus z-VAD.FMK were co-injected intrastriatally followed 3 hr later by an injection of z-VAD.FMK alone (0.3 l each). z-VAD.FMK was also administered i.c.v.  15   \n\nRESULTS\n\n\nReduction of Ischemic Infarction by the Inhibitors of the ICE Family.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEighteen hours after reperfusion, the forebrains were divided into five coronal (2-mm) sections using a mouse brain matrix (RBM-2000C; Activational Systems, Warren, MI), and the sections were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma). The infarcted areas were quantitated by an image-analysis system (Bioquant IV; R & M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) and calculated by summing the volumes of each section determined directly  (39)  or indirectly by the following formula: contralateral hemisphere (mm 3 ) \u03ea ipsilateral undamaged volume (mm 3 ; ref. 40). Although statistical significance was achieved by both methods of analysis, only data from the direct method are presented. Brain swelling was calculated according to the following formula: [(infarct volume \u03e9 ipsilateral undamaged volume \u03ea contralateral volume) \u03eb 100\u035econtralateral volume (%)]. For histological evaluation of neuronal damage at 18 hr and 3 days after ischemia, sections (12 m) were stained with hematoxylin\u035eeosin.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or non-subcellular resolution. It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCR is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins, or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein activation, or that internalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response. Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternate interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCR are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR, and its cognate G protein, Gs in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \ninternalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response \n10  . Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternate interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCR are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR  11  , and its cognate G protein, G s (ref. 12) in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, while it remains clear that \u03b2 2 -ARs can elicit G s -mediated signal transduction from the plasma membrane, the present data reveal a discrete component of the acute signalling response that is initiated from endosomes (Fig.  4g ). It remains unknown if \u03b2 2 -ARs are continuously bound by agonist in endosomes, as depicted in the figure for simplicity, but conformational activation of G s in endosomes is both receptor and agonist-dependent. Unambiguous detection of endosome-based activation of acute G-protein-linked signalling is presently limited to the \u03b2 2 -AR G s system for which the critical nanobodies are available. However, we believe that endosome-based contribution to the acute signalling response is likely widespread in the GPCR superfamily because the \u03b2 2 -AR belongs to the largest group (family A) of GPCR and is often considered a prototype. We also suggest, more generally, that nanobody-based biosensors represent a versatile strategy for probing other types of dynamic conformational change with high spatiotemporal resolution in living cells.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause endosomes contain activated \u03b2 2 -ARs, we next asked if receptors engage their cognate G protein from this compartment. Heterotrimeric G proteins and adenylyl cyclase can be observed in endosomes as well as at the plasma membrane, supporting the concept of endosome-based G protein signalling  4, 6, 10, 24  . To directly investigate the subcellular location of G protein activation, we developed a distinct biosensor based on another nanobody, Nb37, which specifically recognizes the guanine-nucleotide-free form of G\u03b1 s representing the catalytic intermediate of G protein activation (Fig.  4a )  25  . We hoped that because Nb37 binds a surface of the alpha-helical domain that is accessible only in the nucleotide-free form, we would be able to detect production of this critical but fleeting activation intermediate in living cells. This was indeed the case because Nb37-GFP localized in the cytoplasm of untreated cells and was rapidly recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to isoprenaline application (Fig.  4b , yellow arrowhead, Pearson coefficient = 0.627).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

BBB compromise has been found in many pathological conditions, including neuroinflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), a chemokine that is transiently and significantly up-regulated during inflammation, is able to disrupt the integrity of BBB and modulate the progression of various diseases, including excitotoxic injury and hemorrhage. In this review, we first introduce the biochemistry and biology of MCP1, and then summarize the effects of MCP1 on BBB integrity as well as individual BBB components. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition, ZO-1 has been detected in the nucleus and shown to co-localize with transcription factors in some conditions  [106] [107] [108] [109] , suggesting its potential role as a signaling molecule. BMeCs as the major barrier of BBB have been under extensive investigations. Accumulating evidence shows that MCP1 compromises BBB integrity via redistribution of tight junction proteins from cell-cell border (probable via endocytosis) and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in BMeCs  [65] [66] [67] 72] . we have previously been able to verify these data and further show that these changes are dependent on plasmin activity  [71] . Mechanistic studies reveal that phosphorylation of TJP regulates their functions and locations  [95, 96, [110] [111] [112] . Stamatovic and colleagues further demonstrated that the binding of MCP1 to CCR2 activated PKC (specifically PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b6) and Rho kinase, resulting in shift of tight junction proteins from cell border to intracellular compartments  [65, 66] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn addition, the BM also contributes to the integrity of BBB through individual eCM proteins, which not only anchor different cells in place at BBB but also regulate cellular processes  [51, 131, 143, 144, 157] . It has been shown that laminin, collagen type Iv, and fibronectin increase TeeR of brain capillary endothelial cells  [158] . Dystroglycan, a major receptor for eCM proteins, is selectively cleaved at the parenchymal BM at sites of leukocyte infiltration during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  [144] . Additionally, laminin \u03b15, an endothelial BM-specific component, has been shown to serve as a barrier for leukocyte translocation  [51] . These results suggest that eCM proteins and their receptors also contribute to the integrity of BBB. Consistent with the detrimental role of MCP1 in BBB integrity, MCP1 has been found to promote hydrogen peroxide induced eCM protein degradation  [159] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPerturbation of BBB has been found in many neurological conditions, including trauma  [50, 51] , brain tumors  [52, 53] , stroke  [54] [55] [56] , and neurodegenerative diseases  [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] , and BBB breakdown is one of the hallmarks that accompany the progression of these diseases. Recently, BBB compromise has been found to play a causative role in the onset of Alzheimer's disease  [57]  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  [62] . A large number of molecules have been reported to affect the permeability of BBB, such as MCP1, TNF-\u03b1, . Here, we focus on the effect of MCP1 on BBB integrity. It has been shown that injection of recombinant mouse MCP1 into the brain disrupts BBB integrity  [65-67, 71, 72] . we have previously been able to further demonstrate that plasmin-mediated truncation of MCP1 is indispensable for MCP1-induced BBB compromise  [71] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We observe that the crystallization time and thin film structure are strongly influenced by the chemical nature and porosity of the substrate. Moreover, we find that the mesoporous scaffold can tune the emissive properties of the semiconducting compound both in terms of spectral region and dynamics. In particular, perovskite crystallites grown in the nanometre size porous scaffold present a shorter-living and blue-shifted emission with respect to the perovskite crystals which are free to grow without any constraints. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs a further evolution, thin film architectures have been particularly successful  6, 11, 12  demonstrating performances comparable to traditional inorganic thin-film solar cells.  13, 14  While we have borne witness to unbelievable progress and evolution of photovoltaic devices based on these materials, the huge gap in understanding when moving from the pristine molecules to their embodiment in a device can severely hamper their widespread adoption in optoelectronic applications. From the literature it is clear that every preliminary test of these materials in device architectures has revealed exciting surprises, however their working mechanisms remain remarkably obscure. Our poor understanding of the relationship between structure and optoelectronic properties is a key shortcoming, especially given that hybrid perovskites are intrinsically complex materials, where the presence of various types of interactions and structural disorder may play an important role in the material properties. The difficulty in predicting the response of these materials to the interaction with external stimuli makes it impossible to frame them as a proper technology. Due to the critical role of structural interactions of the organic/inorganic components, different crystallization/deposition methodologies a M. De Bastiani and V. D'Innocenzo contributed equally to this work.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn particular, we believe that the emission shown in Figure  4 (a) arises from the superposition of two different contributions coming from the two layers in the thin film which get sequentially excited by the laser, i.e., the perovskite infiltrated into the mesoporous scaffold (short-living emission peaking around 760 nm) and the capping layer (long-living emission peaking at around 775 nm). This indicates that the shortening of the lifetime in presence of the scaffold is not simply due to PL quenching process, but it is related to an intrinsic change in the crystallite optoelectronic properties, in agreement with the absorption spectra taken from samples with similar architectures  28  showing that the fully mesostructured film is characterized by a blue-shifted absorption onset with respect to the flat film. Ball et al.  4  have already demonstrated that the perovskite crystals present in the capping layer are larger in size, going from less than 50 nm in the scaffold, where the crystal growth is constrained, to crystals larger than 500 nm when they are left to grow freely.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, we propose that the capping layer and the mesostructured film may be considered as two different compounds with different photoluminescence properties. In summary, we demonstrate that the nature of the substrate critically affects the structural and optical properties of the perovskite films by changing the crystallization dynamics. We have observed that the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3-x Cl x crystals form in only 1 min on ZnO substrates. This may have\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Thus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.\nDuCHENNE muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene located on the X chromosome. Dystrophin, the high-molecular weight protein product of the DMD gene  1  , is localized to the sarcolemmal membrane of normal skeletal muscle  2 -5  but is absent from the skeletal muscle of people with DMD 1 \u2022 2 \u2022 6 , xmd dogs 7 and mdx mice 1 \u2022 5 (the last two being possible animal models for DMD).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor example, muscle from mdx mice shows elevated intracellular ionized Ca 2 + levels and corresponding higher net degradation of muscle proteins  20  \u2022 Loss of a dystrophin-anchored protein with a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium could result in elevated intracellular calcium levels and lead to the reported activation of calciumdependent protease activities  21  \u2022 Such a mechanism could explain the abnormal muscle protein degradation and fibre necrosis of dystrophic muscle. The absence of dystrophin-associated proteins in dystrophic muscle may complicate the therapeutic efficacy of myoblast transfer  22  , as the reintroduction of dystrophin synthesis might not lead to recovery of associated protein levels and thus could necessitate treatment at only one particular developmental stage. Finally, a deficiency or defect in a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein could perhaps explain the DMD-like symptoms observed in suspected autosomal-recessive patients  23  \u2022 24 that express apparently normal dystrophin.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe amino-acid sequence of dystrophin suggests that it is a membrane cytoskeletal protein  8 \u2022 9  involved in the anchoring of sarcolemmal proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton. But the exact function of dystrophin and its precise role in the resulting necrosis of dystrophic muscle fibres has not been determined. In studies of other genetic diseases involving proteins of the cytoskeleton  10 ' 11  , the absence of one component is sometimes accompanied by the loss of another cytoskeletal protein.

They exhibit a significantly improved dispersibility in organic solvents such as\ntetrahydrofurane and dichloromethane. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nDiamond nanoparticles have found considerable interest recently due to their potential applications in biological systems, composites and electronic applications  [1] . Their apparent biocompatibility [2] and chemical inertness make them an ideal candidate for all kinds of biomedical devices. On the other hand, their surface can be functionalised with a variety of groups in order to incorporate them into polymer matrices, surface coatings and the like  [3] . An essential prerequisite for these applications is the control of surface structure and particle size and agglomeration. So far, different approaches for the surface functionalisation and deagglomeration have been taken. Chiganova produced diamond hydrosols from oxidized detonation diamond [4], whereas Xu and coworkers used surface active compounds for the dispersion of nanodiamond particles  [5] . Khabashesku et al. obtained small agglomerates of \u223c160 nm in size by the fluorination of detonation diamond  [6] . These particles formed stable suspensions in THF. Another approach is the mechanical deagglomeration in suspension by stirred media milling  [7]  or beads assisted sonic disintegration  [8] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn the latter solvent no sedimentation was observed for a period of one month. The particle size of the agglomerates in the suspensions was reduced from several micron (pristine ND: \u223c 15 \u03bcm, ND-OH: \u223c 6 \u03bcm) to 300-450 nm in the case of ND-OOC-C 3 H 7 (2), 150-260 nm for ND-OOC-C 5 H 11  (3) , \u223c170 nm for ND-OOC-C 12 H 23 (4), and 170-300 nm for ND-OOC-C 18 H 37  (5) . Fig.  3  shows the development of suspensions of pristine detonation diamond and compounds 1-5 in dichloromethane. The stable dispersion of functionalised nanodiamond in organic solvents opens the way to further surface modification in more homogeneous systems leading to better accessibility of the surface groups as well as a more homogeneous distribution of the diamond particles in the medium. Carboxylic groups with terminal surface groups have to be reacted with the diamond surface if further reactions are to be carried out. This work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary we have modified the surface of hydroxylated detonation nanodiamond with alkyl chains of different length by an esterification reaction of carboxylic acid chlorides with the surface hydroxyl groups. The resulting materials had a surface loading of 0.3-0.4 mmol g -1 and showed a much better dispersibility in several organic solvents along with a smaller particle size of the remaining agglomerates. This enables the homogeneous incorporation of such materials in non-hydrophilic matrices and further modification in stable suspension. In the future, it will be important to further reduce the agglomerate size by such chemical deagglomeration and stabilization techniques down to the primary particles.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These methods have begun to unravel key questions in cancer biology that have been difficult to address with bulk tumor measurements. Over the past five years, there has been extraordinary progress in technological developments and research applications, but these efforts represent only the tip of the iceberg. In the coming years, SCS will greatly improve our understanding of invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance during cancer progression. These tools will also have direct translational applications in the clinic, in areas such as early detection, noninvasive monitoring, and guiding targeted therapy. In this perspective, I discuss the progress that has been made and the myriad of unexplored applications that still lie ahead in cancer research and medicine. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nEarly detection is another clinical application of SCS, which can provide genomic information on rare tumor cells. In samples collected from bodily fluids (blood, urine, feces, and phlegm), it may be possible to isolate single cancer cells at the earliest stages of cancer progression. If driver mutations can be identified in multiple single cancer cells, then they may represent a clonal expansion, which could be followed by imaging techniques and surgical resection of microlesions. Another important clinical application of SCS is for obtaining genomic data sets from scarce clinical samples, which often contain only hundreds of tumor cells and are frequently unable to undergo genetic tests due to Quantity Not Sufficient (QNS). Perhaps the most immediate application of SCS in the clinic will be in noninvasive monitoring. By isolating and sequencing single CTCs in the blood, it may be possible to measure somatic mutations that are present at the primary or metastatic tumor sites without the inherent risks that are associated with performing an invasive core biopsy directly at the organ site. Additionally, this noninvasive approach can allow the oncologist to collect serial samples over time during the course of therapy to monitor response and the emergence of resistant clones.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSingle-cell cancer genomics\n\n\nConclusions and future directions\nIn the first five years since its inception, SCS has already revolutionized our understanding of cancer evolution and diversity. Although initial studies focused mainly on technology development and intratumor heterogeneity in primary tumors, the field has now shifted toward understanding more complex biological processes in cancer, including invasion, metastasis, and the evolution of therapy resistance. These tools have also begun to provide new insight into the role of rare cells in tumor progression, particularly in the context of metastatic dissemination. Future studies will begin to unravel the spatial organization of tumor clones in tissues and will connect phenotypic behaviors of cancer cells with their genotypes. This will require combining SCS with multiple experimental systems, including xenografts, GEMs, cell cultures, and organoid systems. As DNA-and RNA-SCS methods continue to mature, their translation into the clinic is inevitable and will have a major impact on patient lives.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAnother group applied single-cell exome sequencing to study clonal diversity in a JAK2 myeloproliferative disease  (Hou et al. 2012 ) and a kidney tumor  (Xu et al. 2012) . These data showed that single cells share common founder mutations, suggesting evolution from a common origin, but had difficulty in resolving clonal substructure and genetic lineages due to high error rates. However, in subsequent studies, the same group applied singlecell exome sequencing to study clonal substructure in a muscle-invasive bladder cancer  (Li et al. 2012 ) and a colon cancer  (Yu et al. 2014) , which revealed two major subpopulations in each tumor that diverged but shared a common genetic lineage. Another group applied DNA SCS to delineate clonal diversity in glioblastoma, which revealed convergent evolution of EGFR mutations and rearrangements in different subclones from the same primary tumors  (Francis et al. 2014) . DNA-SCS has also been applied to study hematological malignancies.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A circularly polarized light is completely converted to the cross-polarized light which can either be bent or focused tightly near the diffraction limit. It depends on a precise control of the optical-axis profile of the antennas on a subwavelength scale, in which the rotation angle of the optical axis has a simple linear relationship to the phase discontinuity. Such an approach enables effective wave front engineering within a subwavelength scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFig.  3 .

The phase associated with the incident polarization state leads to the optical spin dependent phenomenon in our proposed metamaterial structures  [14] . The analytical prediction could map the main feature of the numerical results, as shown in Fig.  3 (b), 3(d), 3(f), 3(h), where the displayed region in analytical description is from 2a to 20a along the z direction. By far, we can model the most representative parabolic phase to realize the convex or concave wave front through rotating the optic axes of the antennas investigated, which is different from conventional optical components, where the spatial phase profile relies on light propagation over different optical lengths. Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1 (e) . Taking into account of the linear and parabolic phase discontinuity along the metamaterial surface through an array of split ring aperture antenna with defined profiles of the rotation angles, as depicted in Fig.  1(c ), one representative structure (A) is designed and is composed of 11 rotating antennas to realize the linear phase variation from 0 to 2 \u03c0 . Considering the finite size of the unit cell, the phase variation is not continuous but is discrete. For structure A, each unit cell only needs a discrete rotation with step size of 0.1 \u03c0 to realize the linear phase variation from 0 to 2 \u03c0 . The case of structure B contains 15 rotating resonators with defined rotation angle to realize the parabolic phase variation in Eq. (  4 ). Here, we emphasize that phase variation acquired by rotating optical axis is free of dispersion of the resonator, as we could keep the desired anisotropic behavior. To verify our proposed scheme, we have performed full-wave simulations using CST Microwave Studio, based on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm  [28] . We utilize the perfect conductor approximation (PCA) for simplicity.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}
