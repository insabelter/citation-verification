This paper proposes a fault analysis method of motors based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis. To achieve this goal, fault fuzzy production rules of three-phase induction motors are first proposed. Then, the rMFRSNPS is presented to model the rules, which provides an intuitive way for modelling the motors. Moreover, to realize the parallel data computing and information reasoning in the fault prediction and diagnosis process, three reasoning algorithms for the rMFRSNPS are proposed: the pulse value reasoning algorithm, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm, and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm. Finally, some case studies are given, in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAutomatic implementation of fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems for diagnosing faults in complex power systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHNRong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKYi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGXZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJDong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPPaul\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZHuang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComplexity\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\t16\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA rough set-based bioinspired fault diagnosis method for electrical substations\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJBZhao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInternational Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\t119\n\t\t\t105961\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSimplified and yet turing universal spiking neural P systems with polarizations optimized by anti-spikes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFXu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNeurocomputing\n\t\t\n\t\t\t414\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNomenclature\nES:Expert system ANN:Artificial neural network PN:Petri net SNPS: Spiking neural P system rMFRSNPSs: Modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers PVRA:Pulse value reasoning algorithm FFPRA:Forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm BAFDRA:Backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm MCS:Minimum cut set PMCS:Precise minimum cut set PN:Proposition neuron RN:Rule neuron MSAF-12:Method of selection of amplitudes of frequencies FPN:Fuzzy petri net FFPN:Fuzzy fault petri net IAAC:Improved artificial ant clustering.\nConflicts of InterestAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMoving integration filter-based open-switch fault-diagnosis method for threephase induction motor drive systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSShi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYSun\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHDan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification\n\t\t\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA novel controllable crowbar based on fault type protection technique for DFIG wind energy conversion system using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tONoureldeen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIHamdan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProtection and Control of Modern Power Systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAdaptive fault diagnosis of motors using comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer with fuzzy petri net\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXZCheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCGWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMLi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComputing and Informatics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t39\n\t\t\t1-2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDetection and localization of asymmetry in stator winding of three phase induction motors based on fuzzy neural petri net\n\t\t\n\t\t\tATRadhi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Engineering Science and Technology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t15\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAn approach for threephase asynchronous motor failure analysis based on fuzzy fault petri net\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXZCheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYJYu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTransactions of China Electrotechnical Society\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\t17\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDetermination of the median effective concentration (EC50) of propofol during oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in children\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGBHammer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCLitalien\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVWellis\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDRDrover\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPaediatr Anaesth\n\t\t\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2001\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe median effective concentration (EC50) of propofol with different doses of fentanyl during colonoscopy in elderly patients\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFYu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHZhu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYYang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLYang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJLian\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBMC Anesthesiol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t16\n\t\t\t24\n\t\t\t2016\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBinding of propofol to blood components: implications for pharmacokinetics and for pharmacodynamics\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJXMazoit\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKSamii\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBr J Clin Pharmacol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t47\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1999\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSerum from the sevoflurane patient reduced NK cell activating receptor CD16, IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, all thus lowering the activity level of NK cells [22,23].\nPro-tumor effectsIn 2002, Garib et al. observed that propofol (3-9 \u03bcg/mL) increased migration of MDA-MB-468 cells [24]. They also found that propofol increased intracellular calcium and altered the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of these cells [25]. These effects of propofol were inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. The group tested the hypothesis that propofol was acting via GABA-A receptor chloride channels. Although they found evidence for the gamma subunit of the GABA-A receptor and the effect of propofol was inhibited by the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline, they did not provide evidence for functional channels in the cells.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPropofolinduced calcium signalling and actin reorganization within breast carcinoma cells\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVGarib\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKLang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBNiggemann\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKSZanker\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLBrandt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTDittmar\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEur J Anaesthesiol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t22\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2005\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBicuculline block of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRKhawaled\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tABruening-Wright\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPAdelman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMaylie\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPflugers Arch\n\t\t\n\t\t\t438\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1999\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPropofol induces proliferation partially via downregulation of p53 protein and promotes migration via activation of the Nrf2 pathway in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCMeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLSong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXCui\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOncol Rep\n\t\t\n\t\t\t37\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

By collecting the bibliographic data of 714 papers on ceramic textiles from 1990 to the presentin the WoS core database, from the perspective of bibliometrics, analyze the time distribution, space distribution, researchorganization distribution, and research direction of ceramics in textile applications, then use methods such as subject wordclustering, keyword clustering, and emergent word detection, explore the core content of the research on the application ofceramics in textiles, research hotspots, and future development trends. The study found that the research on ceramic textilesis currently in the extension stage, the papers published by Chinese scholars rank first in the world, but the importance is low.\nThe research has gone through three stages, research hotspots include ceramic textile composite performance, preparationtechnology, heat preservation, composite material preparation, and application, etc, \u201cmicrostructure\u201d, \u201crefinement\u201d and\u2018temperature\u2019 are research hotspots in this field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the table, China's intermediary centrality is lower than that of the United Kingdom and even France, which ranks sixth in publications, the analysis believes that academic exchange activities are mainly caused by the country's geographic location, lower than the academic exchanges between European and American countries [17].\nDistribution of institutionsThrough the analysis of the distribution of research institutions, in addition to getting rid of the overall situation of the country, we can explore the current key research institutions in this field, this is the focus of academic research in this field, it is also convenient for researchers to understand the distribution of research forces in this field. The node type selects \"Organization\" and other parameters default, obtain the research collinear map of ceramic textile institutions (Fig. 2), in the co-occurrence network diagram, the number of occurrences of the node size indicator is high, reflecting the important status of the research institution, the more connections indicate the greater the number of partnerships, the thicker the connections indicate the stronger the degree of cooperation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nResearch methods and toolsThe research uses information science from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, and the information visualization software CiteSpace developed by the Java language developed by Professor Chen Chaomei of the School of Technology in 2004, one of the theoretical sources of the software is Kuhn's scientific development paradigm theory, it is believed that scientific development can be extracted from published literature through its footprint, through combing through a large amount of literature, using its own algorithm to detect the development history and hot areas of a certain discipline or field, mainly through visualization functions such as keyword analysis, emergence analysis, co-citation analysis, and knowledge node analysis, etc, demonstrate and analyze the evolution trend and knowledge connection status of the frontier of the discipline. In the network map, the size of the nodes represents how often they appear, and the lines between them represent the strength of cooccurrence. In order to ensure the consistency of the literature and research topics, use Citespace's internal processing mechanism to remove the weight and relevance of the obtained documents, finally, 714 valid documents were obtained, a ceramic project was established, and the obtained data was imported for visual analysis [12].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nChina is a leading country in the publication of ceramics in textile applications, but the earliest included in the WoS core library was in 2008, and it was later included, it should be affected by the language and the degree of internationalization of our country, but it also reflects the rapid development of China's ceramic textile field in recent years. The country with the earliest documents included in the WoS core database is the United Kingdom, and its total documents are second only to China, ranking second [16].In addition, the centrality in Cite space can reflect the intermediary status of academic research.

This work contributes to the knowledge of research and development trends of the textile manufacturing and apparel industry in a macroscopic way. The Web of Science database and the core set of the Web of Science was explored and 2852 articles in the related fields are identified from 2010 to 2019. The scientific knowledge map of the textile manufacturing technology industry is explored using CiteSpace software. For the last decade, the developmental status, research hotspots and developmental trends of the textile manufacturing and apparel industry are analysed and summarised from the perspectives of key words, hot trends and core authors. The outcomes obtained reveal that in the past 10 years, through the analysis of the technical literature of the textile manufacturing industry, different perspectives were explored where the textile manufacturing industry develops from the initial textile manufacturing treatment. The decolourisation and removal of azo dyes and other traditional textile manufacturing to the composite materials, cotton fabrics leads to the improvement of textile manufacturing wastewater treatment. Currently, the textile manufacturing industry technology has gradually developed towards an intelligent knowledge visualization and decision support. Therefore, this work suggests the developmental directions of textile manufacturing from traditional to intelligent trends, further providing a reference for the later developmental trend and the dynamic planning of China\u2019s textile manufacturing industry technology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nVisual analysis of time-series similarities for anomaly detection in sensor networks Computer graphics forum\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSteiger\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNormalisation techniques for collaborative networks\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNVafaei\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tKybernetes\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA route stability-based multipath QoS routing protocol in cognitive radio ad hoc networks\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSAlqahtani\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAAlotaibi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWireless Network\n\t\t\n\t\t\t25\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIndustry 4.0: a survey on technologies, applications and open research issues\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of industrial information integration\n\t\t\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRRPawlak\n\t\t\n\t\tSolving Complex industrial problems without statistics\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCRC Press\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAn overview on corporate response towards sustainability issues in Textile manufacturing industry\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADesore\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSANarula\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ].

In Chagas disease, pleiotropic cytokine TNF is considered key in immunopathology. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the levels of TNF, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in the serum of patients with chronic Chagas disease. TNF and its soluble receptors were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array in the serum of 132 patients, of which 51 had the indeterminate form (IND), 39 the mild cardiac form (CARD 1), 42 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 non-infected individuals (NI). The results indicate that the soluble receptors may regulate TNF in Chagas disease, as their leves were higher in T. cruzi-infected individuals when compared to non-infected individuals. We found a moderate negative correlation between sTNFR1 and TNF in individuals with the IND form, suggesting a relationship with non-progression to more severe forms, such as heart disease. sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were increased in all clinical forms, but with a moderate positive correlation in more severe patients (r = 0.50 and p = 0.0005). TNF levels showed no statistical differences in the groups of patients. These findings suggest the importance of the endogenous balance of the levels of soluble TNF receptors in the protection and balance in patients with chronic Chagas disease, besides revealing the immunological complexity in chronic T. cruzi-infected individuals. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe endogenous balance of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors and tumor necrosis factor modulates cachexia and mortality in mice acutely infected with Trypanosoma cruzi\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCTruyens\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFTorrico\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRLucas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPDe Baetselier\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWABuurman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYCarlier\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInfect.

We investigated the association of physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process with blood glucose level. Methods 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET scans acquired from 44 patients (male:female=20:24, age=50.8\u00b114.8y [mean\u00b1SD]) were retrospectively analyzed. The blood glucose level (BGL) was examined before 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC injection. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and patients with BGL over 200\u00a0mg/dl were excluded. 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake was measured by the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). Additionally, SSTR-positive volume (SV) in the pancreas uncinate process was measured with two diferent thresholds: by SUV cutof of 2.5 (SV2.5) and 40% of SUVmax (SV40%). These measurements on 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET were correlated with BGL. Results The mean of SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process was 6.51\u00b12.04. SV2.5 was 17.81\u00b17.14 cm3 , and SV40% was 18.20\u00b18.83 cm3 . A signifcant negative correlation was found between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BGL (r=-0.37, p=0.01). The ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the pancreas body also showed a signifcance negative correlation with BGL (r=-0.40, p=0.01). SV2.5 (r=0.27, p=0.07) and SV40% (r=-0.151, p=0.32) were not signifcantly correlated with BGL. Conclusion Physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process was negatively correlated with BGL. Our results suggested that glycemia could afect physiologic uptake of 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe continuous variables were represented by mean \u00b1 SD. The correlation was analyzed by Pearson correlation, and a p value of 0.05 or lower was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA).\nResults\nPatient CharacteristicsThe mean age of 44 patients was 50.8 years (SD, 14.8; range, 7-71). Among 44 patient, 22 (50%) patients were diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, of which 9 patients with pancreatic NET, 8 patients with rectal NET, and 5 patients with other or unknown origins. Twelve patients (27%) were diagnosed as pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Other 10 (23%) patients were diagnosed with other tumors except NET including meningioma. Demographics and diagnosis of patients were summarized in Table 1. BGL of 44 patients were 107.5 \u00b1 37.5 mg/dL (70-145 mg/dL), and the distribution of BGL is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the normal pancreas body showed a significant negative correlation with BGL (r = -0.40, p = 0.01), and the ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BP SUVmean also showed a significant negative correlation with BGL (r = -0.34, p = 0.02).

Codon optimization is a frequently used strategy to accelerate protein synthesis rate. Besides regulating protein translation speed, codon usage bias has also be reported to affect co-translation folding and transcription. P. pastoris is a well-developed expression system, whose efficiency is tightly correlated with commercial value. However, few studies focus on the role of codon usage bias in affecting protein expression in P. pastoris. Besides, many genes in P. pastoris genome show significant negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency. It's not known whether this feature is important for their expression. In order to answer these questions, we picked 4P. pastoris gene candidates with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder. We then performed full-length codon optimization which completely eliminated the correlation. Protein and RNA assays were then used to compare protein and mRNA levels before and after codon optimization. As a result, codon optimization failed to elevate their protein expression levels, and even resulted in a decrease. As represented by the trypsin sensitivity assays, codon optimization also altered the protein structure of 0616 and 0788. Besides protein, codon optimization also affected mRNA levels. Shown by in vitro and in vivo RNA degradation assays, the mRNA stability of 0616, 0788 and 0135 were also altered by codon optimization. For each gene, the detailed effect may be related with its specific sequence and protein structure. Our results suggest that codon usage bias is an important factor to regulate gene expression level, as well as mRNA and protein stabilities in P. pastoris. \"Extreme\" codon optimization in genes with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency may not be favored. Compromised strategies should be tried if expression is not successful. Besides, codon optimization may affect protein structural conformation more severely in structural disordered proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt has been pointed out there was a potential correlation between gene sequence and transcription speed. Specific nucleotide pentamers (5 consecutive nucleotide bases) tended to have a specific transcription rate which was highly conserved in different genes (Cohen et al., 2018). Besides, a correlation between codon usage bias and nuclear RNA levels has also been reported in the genome of N. crassa. A batch of transcription factors or histone transmethylases might be involved in supporting this correlation (Zhao et al., 2021). In vivo studies in N. crassa showed that the transcriptional activity of luciferase increased with codon optimization, which was unrelated with translation. The inner mechanism was further revealed as reduced gene silencing marker H3K9me3 levels in codon optimized sequences (Larrondo et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2016). In addition to histone modification, previously we also identified the potential correlation among codon choice, cytosine methylation sites and mRNA levels (Xing et al., 2020). In addition to transcription elongation, codon bias may also play a regulatory role at the step of termination.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTable 11CAI value, disorder tendency score and correlation of 4 gene candidates.GeneNameCAIDisorderLengthCorrelationMw(Protein)(Protein)PAS_FragD_00130.7660.247111-0.72415.7kDPAS_chr1-1_01350.8170.294266-0.55228.7kDPAS_chr1-4_06160.7040.679227-0.53924.9kDPAS_chr4_07880.7250.181255-0.63031.7kD\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAcknowledgmentsThis work was sponsored by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0900300] and Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Rising-Star Program [19QA1402600].\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2018YFA0900300\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t19QA1402600\n\t\t\t\t\tRising-Star Program\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nDeclaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAfter that, the influence of codon bias on protein structure and function was subsequently confirmed on D. melanogaster circadian clock core component dPER and N. crassa Cross Pathway Control Protein 1 (CPC-1) (Fu et al., 2016;Lyu and Liu, 2020). In addition, a significant negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder was identified in the genomes of five model organisms: E. coli, N. crassa, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans and D. melanogaster. The use of non-optimal codons in some regions may be a mechanism to reduce translation speed and provide enough folding time (Zhou et al., 2015).Compared with translation, the influence of codon usage bias on transcription has been overlooked for years. Although synonymous codon substitution does not alter amino acid sequence, the nucleotide sequence is then changed and is likely to affect the mRNA level in terms of transcription activity and mRNA stability (Hia and Takeuchi, 2021). It has been pointed out there was a potential correlation between gene sequence and transcription speed.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Some require this external circuit to be changed during the run due to coagulopathy or mechanical failure. Circuit change(s) can result in massive fluid shifts, weight gain, and hemodynamic instability, with negative implications for the patient. Predictors for undergoing circuit changes and its impact on outcomes remain unclear. We hypothesized that circuit changes during ECMO support would correlate with increased morbidity and mortality.\nMethods\nPatients with one ECMO run lasting 30 days or less at a tertiary children\u2019s hospital between 2010-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. LASSO logistic regression models were built to identify independent predictors for undergoing a circuit change. Bivariate regression analysis was used to compare outcomes in patients undergoing a circuit change to those who did not. Primary outcome of interest was mortality on ECMO; secondary outcomes included major bleeding, neurologic, and infectious morbidities; p<0.05 was significant.\nResults\nOne hundred ninety-one patients were included; 144 (75%) had no circuit change, while 47 (25%) had one or more circuit change(s). Lower gestational age at birth (p=0.04), higher WBC (p=0.03), higher platelet transfusion during ECMO (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for undergoing a circuit change. Compared to those who did not undergo a circuit change, patients who did had longer median ECMO duration (p<0.001), higher rates of bleeding complications (p=0.02), and higher mortality (p=0.03).\nConclusion\nChanging the circuit while on ECMO support was associated with longer ECMO duration, higher mortality, and higher bleeding complications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNegative Correlation Between Neonatal and Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Circuit Changes and Patient Outcomes\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMDNiloufarHafezi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana University School of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndianapolis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMD, FACSTroyAMarkel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana University School of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndianapolis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBSNatalieMark\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana University School of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndianapolis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSCameronColgate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana University School of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndianapolis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBSSarinaMassoMaldonado\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana University School of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndianapolis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMD, FACSBrianWGray\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana University School of Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndianapolis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCONCLUSION: Strong stewardship by the government and coordinated effort of multiple stakeholders is required to standardize care at these facilities and officially designate them as Karachi's trauma care network.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNegative Correlation Between Neonatal and Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Circuit Changes and Patient Outcomes\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0001B019A700131030E7FCA8602C3194\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nINTRODUCTION:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced life support modality used for reversible heart and/or lung failure in children and neonates.

[citation 11] proposed a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Target positioning based on particle centroid drift in large-scale WSNs \nAbstract: The localization problem of target nodes remains unresolved, especially in large-scale and complex environments. In this paper, we propose a particle centroid drift (PCD) algorithm to reduce the distance errors between nodes and obtain the particle aggregation region by using the drift vector. First, we use the particle quality prediction function to obtain the particles in a high-likelihood region. The high-quality particles have high probability in the calculation, which can increase the number of effective particles and enable avoiding particle degradation. Then, the centroid drift vector is used to make the particle distribution similar to the actual reference distribution. Experiments are conducted on state-space models: the local movement where 55% nodes are moving and the globe movement where 100% nodes are moving. The results show that the proposed algorithm has low estimation errors, a good tracking effect and an acceptable time complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAhmed et al. [13] studied the accuracy in tracking moving objects and calculated the time of object motion. Suggestions for selecting appropriate time parameters were put forward to provide a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Sve cko et al. [11] presented the use of the PF in multiple hops between nodes for distance estimation and connected it with the source node using the radio frequency of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). An improved PF for multitarget tracking was proposed in [26], which was grounded on the drift theory of the stochastic differential equation. The drift theory was used to design a Monte Carlo procedure in a Markov chain, causing the particle samples to be similar to observations. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) proposed in [12] measures the distance between nodes, and the measurement error was contained in the observation function of the motion noise. As a result, the positions of objects were determined by a weighted aggregation and by maximizing the PSO. Hou et al. [27] proposed an improved cubature PF algorithm that uses the least squares to estimate the prior states of target nodes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTypical examples of range-free algorithms include Amorphous [8], Distance Vector-Hop(DV-Hop) [9], Multi Dimentional Scaling Map(MDS-MAP) [10], Distance Vector-short(DV-short) [11] and Approximate Point in Triangulation Test(APTT) [12].Moreover, many scholars have proposed using the connectiveness between nodes to determine a target's current movement position and predict its next position. Bayesianestimation-based filtering algorithms such as the Particle Filter(PF) [13], Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) [14], Extended Kalman Particle Filter(EKPF) [15], Unscented Kalman Filter(UKF) [16] and Hybrid Iterated Kalman Particle Filter(HIKPF) [17] are representative of this scenario. Specifically, the PF can carry out the position estimation of target nodes in nonlinear and non-Gaussian WSNs [18]- [20], but it depends on the initial state of the sensor nodes and cannot accurately measure the Euclidean distance between nodes [21], [22].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, we apply the momentum equation to represent the acceleration and velocity of the particles to avoid complex matrix calculations.Fig. 1 illustrates the framework of the proposed algorithm. The centroid algorithm is to calculate the centroid of the particle population [29] by applying the momentum moment theorem [14], [25], [30]. Combining the centroid with the average particle velocity, the scalar representation is transformed into the momentum. Considering the real conditions, we accommodate the particle acceleration in the framework. The high-quality particle set is obtained according to the nonlinear replication algorithm [23], and the predicted particle set x i 0:t : i = 1, 2, . . . , N is obtained by the PQP algorithm. The weighted centroid drift and the centroid of the predicted particle set are calculated when the centroid velocity solution is applied to the predicted particle set. Finally, we obtain the centroid drift vector by calculating the centroid motion equation, the centroid of the predicted particle set and the weighted centroid drift.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Melanoma care and survival can be improved by early diagnosis, which can be facilitated by the use of noninvasive imaging modalities. Here we review 5 modalities available in clinical practice. Total body photography is used to follow patients at high risk for melanoma by detecting new lesions or subtle changes in existing lesions. Dermoscopy is an effective noninvasive technique for the early recognition of melanoma by allowing clinicians to visualize subsurface structures. Computer-assisted diagnostic devices are fully automated analysis systems with the capacity to classify lesions as benign or malignant with limited involvement from clinicians. Confocal scanning laser microscopy is an in vivo and noninvasive technology that examines the skin at a resolution comparable to that of histology. High-resolution ultrasound is an adjunct diagnostic aid mainly for the early detection of lymph node metastasis. Applications and limitations of each technology are discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs with many novel technologies, the high cost and bulky design of current CSLM devices are considered to be major barriers. Efforts, such as miniaturizing the device and lowering the cost of production can facilitate wider adoption. In addition, extensive training in both the acquisition and the interpretation of CSLM images is needed. Like dermoscopy, there is a steep learning curve to master the interpretation of CSLM images. Lastly, the technology has intrinsic limitations where CSLM evaluation can give rise to false-positive or falsenegative results. 64,78,79 \nHigh-Resolution UltrasoundMedical ultrasonography is an ultrasound-based diagnostic imaging modality used to visualize body tissue in real time. Modern ultrasound devices are both portable and relatively inexpensive when compared with other imaging modalities. The ultrasound technology is based on pulse-echo systems in which acoustic pulses are generated by a transducer and propagated to the body tissue. The return waves (echo) from the tissue are detected and converted into images for visual inspection. The resolution of the image and depth of tissue penetration is largely dependent on the frequency of the ultrasound transducer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn general, the dermoscopic image qualities from PD and NPD are relatively similar. The major difference is that surface dermoscopic structures (eg, comedone-like openings, milia-like cysts and blue white veil) are better observed with NPD. In contrast, deep structures (eg, vessels) are better seen with PD. 29 The clinical utility of dermoscopy in aiding the diagnosis of melanoma is well documented. A list of these benefits are described in Table 1. 30 Among these benefits, increased diagnostic accuracy is the most important feature. In the hands of experienced users, dermoscopy increases the diagnostic accuracy by more than 40%. 31 This improvement has been verified by several meta-analyses. 23,32,33 For patients, the improvement in diagnostic accuracy directly translates into an improvement of the benign/malignant biopsy ratio. 34 Terushkin et al 35 have shown that a group of clinicians performed fewer biopsies as their dermoscopic acumen increased. Increasing diagnostic confidence is another valuable benefit that appeals to practitioners. 36 By seeing subsurface structures, clinicians have more assurance when they inform their patients about the diagnosis of benign lesions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA steep learning curve often discourages many clinicians from routinely using the device in daily practice. Also, some subset of melanomas (MMs), such as amelanotic/hypomelanotic MMs that lack pigmentations and dermoscopic structures, are exceedingly difficult to diagnose with dermoscopy. Moreover, its role in detecting MMs \u03fd 6 mm remains in debate. 38,39 Nevertheless, for these difficult  lesions, clinicians can perform short-term mole monitoring by taking dermoscopic photos of the concerning lesions. 30,40 Computer-Assisted Diagnostic SystemsThe combination of TBP and dermoscopy has improved diagnostic accuracy, but there are still significant numbers of pigmented lesions that pose a diagnostic challenge. To further improve diagnostic accuracy, various research groups in the world have been engaged in developing equipment and analytical software that can provide objective evaluations and even diagnoses of pigmented skin lesions, especially melanoma. [41][42][43] The ultimate goal is to develop an end-to-end, fully automatic analysis system with a capacity to classify lesions as benign or malignant with a limited involvement from clinicians.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Health information from traditional, online and social media may influence vaccine hesitancy. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of exposure to COVID-19 information from various media on vaccine hesitancy, as well as the mediating roles of public trust in government and vaccine confidence. With a sample of 438 online participants (mean age = 30.69 years) responding to an anonymous questionnaire, the study tested a mediation model using bias-corrected bootstrap. The results indicated that exposure to COVID-19 information from online news media and traditional media can reduce vaccine hesitancy indirectly. Whereas a positive and indirect relationship between COVID-19 information exposure on social media and vaccine hesitancy was revealed. Trust in government and vaccine confidence were found to be salient mediators between exposure to COVID-19 information from various media and vaccine hesitancy. Findings from this study offer implications for strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSocial media, while providing an unprecedented capacity for the public to stay informed on COVID-19 updates, has been a major channel that fuels unsubstantiated rumors regarding COVID-19 and vaccinations that jeopardize public health. Thus, reconciling principles of online information with the policing of social media for malicious falsehoods remains a conundrum. It is imperative for policymakers to invest in digital and media literacy as a solution to disinformation. Second, given the different influence of COVID-19 information exposure, trust in government and vaccine confidence on vaccine hesitancy. Practitioners should use cross-media strategies to communicate tailed information to enhance public trust and confidence toward the government and vaccines. For instance, through traditional news media, online news media, and social media, we should continue to provide vaccine-hesitant individuals with evidence-based information about the ongoing government activities for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, single-item measures were used to investigate participants' COVID-19 information exposure on traditional news media, online news media, and social media, and this might incur measurement errors. Future research should use multiple items to ensure adequate reliability (e.g. internal consistency).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOne plausible reason is that social media contain a fair amount of misinformation that was closely related to public health (Bode & Vraga, 2018;Chou et al., 2018). Given that COVID-19 vaccine development was compressed in time, and news about temporary side effects of the vaccines has been reported and raised global concerns, it is worrying that misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors about COVID-19 and vaccines against the disease were spread widely on the internet (Duffy, 2020;Liu & Huang, 2020). Individuals who relied on social media for COVID-19 related information were more likely to be misinformed by disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines (Burki, 2020;Wilson & Wiysonge, 2020). The spread of disinformation and misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media can weaken people's confidence in vaccine safety and increase vaccine hesitancy.The findings of this study hold valuable practical implications. First, during the outbreak of a pandemic, media environments are of particular importance that determines one's vaccination decisions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSee something, say something: Correction of global health misinformation on social media\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLBode\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEKVraga\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1080/10410236.2017.1331312\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHealth Communication\n\t\t\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe online anti-vaccine movement in the age of COVID-19\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTBurki\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30227-2\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Lancet Digital Health\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTopic analysis of traditional and social media news coverage of the early COVID-19 pandemic and implications for public health communication\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWChipidza\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEAkbaripourdibazar\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTGwanzura\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNMGatto\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1017/dmp.2021.65\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDisaster medicine and public health preparedness\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Safe fatigue lives of the NE, SiC, and Al2O3-SAJs were estimated at different reliability levels. The experimental measurements revelated that reducing the adhesive layer thickness from 0.25 mm to 0.17 mm result in enhancing the tensile strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs by 9.6% and 4.4%, respectively, in return of 9.5% and 5.4% for the Al2O3-SAJ relative to the NE-SAJ. The strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs with 0.17 mm bond thickness are higher than those of the Al2O3-SAJ by 15.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The highest improvement of 22.0% in the fatigue strength was occurred for the SiC-SAJ with bond thickness of 0.17 mm in return of 4.8% for the Al2O3-SAJ. The Up was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints practically the change in the enclosed area of the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large variation in the tan \u03b4, E'', and Ud.

The node type selects \"Organization\" and other parameters default, obtain the research collinear map of ceramic textile institutions (Fig. 2), in the co-occurrence network diagram, the number of occurrences of the node size indicator is high, reflecting the important status of the research institution, the more connections indicate the greater the number of partnerships, the thicker the connections indicate the stronger the degree of cooperation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nResearch methods and toolsThe research uses information science from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, and the information visualization software CiteSpace developed by the Java language developed by Professor Chen Chaomei of the School of Technology in 2004, one of the theoretical sources of the software is Kuhn's scientific development paradigm theory, it is believed that scientific development can be extracted from published literature through its footprint, through combing through a large amount of literature, using its own algorithm to detect the development history and hot areas of a certain discipline or field, mainly through visualization functions such as keyword analysis, emergence analysis, co-citation analysis, and knowledge node analysis, etc, demonstrate and analyze the evolution trend and knowledge connection status of the frontier of the discipline. In the network map, the size of the nodes represents how often they appear, and the lines between them represent the strength of cooccurrence. In order to ensure the consistency of the literature and research topics, use Citespace's internal processing mechanism to remove the weight and relevance of the obtained documents, finally, 714 valid documents were obtained, a ceramic project was established, and the obtained data was imported for visual analysis [12].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nChina is a leading country in the publication of ceramics in textile applications, but the earliest included in the WoS core library was in 2008, and it was later included, it should be affected by the language and the degree of internationalization of our country, but it also reflects the rapid development of China's ceramic textile field in recent years. The country with the earliest documents included in the WoS core database is the United Kingdom, and its total documents are second only to China, ranking second [16].In addition, the centrality in Cite space can reflect the intermediary status of academic research. Centrality is a measure of how connected a particular node is in the entire network, it refers to a certain point in the network, and the ratio of the shortest path connecting these two points to the total number of shortest path lines between these two points, nodes with high centrality are usually the main nodes in the entire network and are used to connect different research topics.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Blockchain technology as a secure and low-cost platform to track the billions of eventual transactions in a distributed energy economy has attracted the attention of experts in various fields of science. The current form of centralized energy trading system is still suffering from security concerns, quality of service, and to name a few. A decentralized energy system using blockchain technology allows the parties to create a trading energy transaction via microgrid. The blockchain technology offers the promise of an immutable, single source of truth from multiple sources without a third-party involvement. In this paper, we describe, explore and analyze the prominent implementation of blockchain technology in the energy sector. Furthermore, we analyze the security issues and highlight the performance of several attacks that might be occurred in the proposed system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn proof of work, blocks are made by mining, which keeps the blockchain safe. A probability of finding nNonce of proof H for given target T is:\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b \u2264 \ud835\udc47) = \ud835\udc47 2 256(1)The disadvantage of proof-work is related to efficiency, which wastes too many computational resources to find the target value (hash puzzle). The hash in PoW begins with several zero-bit hashes (SHA-256) and involves scanning for value when hashing data.\nB. RESILIENT OVERLAY NETWORKAn extensive distributed system is an overlay network that delivers content, applications, and services to a global audience [22]. The chord algorithm in the overlay network provides a fast-distributed computation of hash function mapping keys to nodes responsible for them. It uses consistent hashing [23], which has several good properties. With high probability, when a \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\u210e node joins (or leaves) the network, only an O(1/N) fraction of the keys are moved to a different location. This is the minimum necessary to maintain a balanced load [24]. Fig. 3 shows a possible three-layered software structure for a cooperative mirror system.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe successor to a node is the next node in the identifier circle in a clockwise direction. The predecessor is counter-clockwise. However, typically, there are \"holes\" in the sequence (because of failure or departure). Regarding the possibility of the holes, each node records an arc of 2\ud835\udc5f + 1 nodes in the middle of which it stands, i.e., the list of \ud835\udc5f nodes preceding it and \ud835\udc5f nodes following it. This list results in a high probability that a node can correctly locate its successor or predecessor, even if the network suffers from a high failure rate[21].In our system model, the chord-based distributed system is used to know the node location among the neighbors in the decentralized trading system.\nFig 5 .5Fig 5.

The highest layer would provide an interface to users, including naming.  From the client's side, there is a block, such as a file system, block store, and the chord itself. Block stores and chords are connected to another server and the client from the server. The primary usage of the chord protocol is a query value [21] from a client to find a successor (k). This refers to an O(N) query time, and the N refers to the number of rings applied.As shown in Fig 4 ., each node has a successor and a predecessor. The successor to a node is the next node in the identifier circle in a clockwise direction. The predecessor is counter-clockwise. However, typically, there are \"holes\" in the sequence (because of failure or departure). Regarding the possibility of the holes, each node records an arc of 2\ud835\udc5f + 1 nodes in the middle of which it stands, i.e., the list of \ud835\udc5f nodes preceding it and \ud835\udc5f nodes following it.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

With the widespread availability of internet technology, the frequency of intelligent cyber-attacks in virtual cyber environments, such as APT attacks, continues to rise. Through an intelligent analysis of cyber threats which are still unknown, it is possible to prevent security accidents before they occur through the use of intelligent security analysis methods based on big data. The researcher conducted this empirical study concerning intelligent security analysis methods utilizing big data which are capable of preventing cyber threats, while protecting information assets from risks through evaluation and prediction. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nto express the results of data analysis and improve the level of understanding 2. Intelligent Security Analysis Methods Using Big Data The existing technologies against cyber-attacks utilize network-based security devices such as an IDS (intrusion detection system) or IPS (intrusion prevention system), as well as the technologies that are designed to prevent information leakage from the inside, such as antivirus, database encryption, or other technologies to prevent information theft. In addition, such conventional technologies use integrated security management methods that manage the logs of security products on different models. In particular, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and anti-virus technologies are focused on the development of the platform technology needed to apply signature or blacklist-based detection methods to 10Gbp-level high-performance networks. Also, the changes in the key technologies to counter cyber-attacks were based on integrated security management technologies, and it is expected that an intelligent security analysis model using big data will be the prominent topic of the future.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe analysis of unknown, recent attacks may also help such efforts. In particular, there is a need for methods to respond to and defend against the next generation of cyber-attacks, which disguise themselves as normal activities, as is the case with zero-day vulnerabilities and socialengineering methods. These attacks exploit the weakness of signature database-based detection technology, which thus should be complemented by new technology. In addition, there is a need for a specialized analysis method for the intelligent security analysis utilizing big data, as well as technologies for storing and high-speed processing of distributed searching to support it. In this study, the author performed an empirical study on an intelligent security analysis method utilizing big data, which has been gaining attention recently, while examining the changes in the technologies used in cyber-attacks, which are continuously growing smarter, and the technologies to protect against them.In Chapter 2 of this article, the author conducted a literature review that describes the evolution of cyber-attack technologies, which is followed by Chapter 3 in which the intelligent security analysis method utilizing big data is presented. In Chapter 4, the author explains the intelligent behavioral analysis and verification methods. Finally, Chapter 5 provides the conclusion and suggestions for future research.\nLiterature review1.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1. \nConclusionIn this study, the author conducted an empirical study on intelligent security analysis methods that use big data to protect against ever-changing, agile, and intelligent cyberattackmethods.Recent cyber-terrorist attacks go beyond a handful of hackers showing off their skills for the fun of it, and now pursue a range of ends including threatening national security, causing social unrest, and inflicting financial damages. For this reason, it is necessary to increase our awareness of security issues and how we respond to security breaches. In the future, various cyber-terror attack analyses and studies will be conducted to mitigate damages or prevent them from happening through intelligent security technologies.Embracing big data analysis technologies is one approach to realizing this goal. The information gathered from logs of attack events, which can then be analyzed to find correlations, can aid in detecting and preventing attacks before they occur. Also, to respond to an APT attack, the members of the organization must launch a systematic response. To accomplish this, rather than simply combining individual security solutions with different functions, an organization should implement an advanced, intelligent security solution which can be used to prevent and respond to an APT attack.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consider the first computing problem utilizing a minimum solution matrix. A convex infinite set is generated by a restricted number of closed intervals. Second, computing is an objective-domain nonlinear mathematical optimization problem. A multi-objective optimization problem is used to solve the second programming challenge. The constraint set must be used. Use discrete optimization techniques and branch-and-bound procedures for \u201cdigital integer linear programming\u201d. Our technique has been shown to be both practical and successful. The programming complexity increases as the organization expands. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nProblem (3) can be solved using the idea of a minimal solution matrix presented by Yang et al. While Yang's method fails to provide the whole solution set to the problem, this paper will prove that (3). We could not employ Yang's methods in the original study since it did not address the bi-level problem. This study seeks to discover the best possible solution to the problem stated above, which is bi-level objective programming (3), (4). The final section of Section 3 looks at the ideal solution set for Problem (3) and measures its quality by utilizing a minimum-maximum norm solution matrix. This chapter studies the problem at the second level (4). We use the set of minimum-norm solutions to solve the problem (4). We have included a mathematical example in Section 5 to show how and why our proposed method might be implemented and would produce accurate results. Section 4 discusses several forms of management requirements in order to highlight multiple kinds of bi-level difficulties.\nYang's method for first level problemsThe optimal solution to the issue addressed in this Section 3. Specifically, Yang's method can only be utilized to discover a limited number of optimum solutions to the given problem (3).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdditionally, system administrators may have additional requirements that must be taken into consideration when single-level optimization is employed. Yang et al. examined single-level min-max programming using a BT-P2P file-sharing system (Rastogi et al., 2015;Bulanov et al., 2004). Guu et al. developed bi-level optimization to achieve a balance of realistic management requirements (Bjorklund et al., 2003;Pedrycz, 1985).As per further explored difficult managerial requirements by creating a three-tiered optimization problem for the firm (Stamou and Tzafestas, 2001;Shieh, 2007). Their solution for bilevel optimization with max-product fuzzy relation inequalities included wireless communication. The goals' aspects allow for both management qualities.

Most of them usually assume homogeneous parameters with a specific Gaussian distribution for each domain, ignoring the robust testing of data skewness. This paper proposes to use unsupervised ensemble autoencoders connected to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to adapt to multiple domains regardless of the skewness of each domain. In the hidden space of the ensemble autoencoder, the attention-based latent representation and reconstructed features of the minimum error are utilized. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the sample density in the GMM. When the estimated sample density exceeds the learning threshold obtained in the training phase, the sample is identified as an outlier related to an attack anomaly. Finally, the ensemble autoencoder and the GMM are jointly optimized, which transforms the optimization of objective function into a Lagrangian dual problem. Experiments conducted on three public data sets validate that the performance of the proposed model is significantly competitive with the selected anomaly detection baselines. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAmong recent works, there are also some studies that improve domain adaptability through adversarial learning. They decompose a deep network into feature extractor and classifier components and then train each component by tuning its partner (Xu, Chen, Zuo, Yan, & Lin, 2018). They either use a deep cocktail network (DCTN) to deploy multidirectional adversarial learning to minimize the difference between the targets and multidomain data (Ganin et al., 2016) or use domain-specific representation learning (Schoenauer-Sebag et al., 2019), where the data come from similar but heterogeneous distributions.Although multidomain machine learning solves the problem of domain adaptability to some extent through assumptions about specific data distributions, the performance of most models is poor in practice because they ignore the nature of data skewness and lack a process that effectively determines the robustness of multidomain data. It is claimed that ignoring the inconsistency of the data size and the heterogeneity of the data distribution generated by network traffic will have a serious impact on the detection results and may even mislead the entire machine learning process.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBased on this, Vaca and Niyaz (2018), as an extension, proposed a new parameterization method for the standard residual network architecture, which aimed to increase the number of parameters in a limited way in order to improve the level of parameter sharing between domains. However, these early works did not consider the risk of increased computational complexity caused by the large number of model parameters, which makes such models weak with respect to convergence (Injadat, Moubayed and Shami, 2020). In more recent works inspired by the success of transfer learning, Berriel et al. (2019) and Ren and Lee (2018) proposed a combination of serial and parallel network adapters for multidomain data. They obtained domain-related models with adjustable budgets in terms of the number of parameters and computational complexity. To adjust the computational complexity of the network, they adopted a pretrained architecture to derive a specialized deep model for each domain and then incorporated a budget-aware adapter to select the most relevant feature channel to better process the data from the new domain. Among recent works, there are also some studies that improve domain adaptability through adversarial learning.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTrainable activation function with differentiable negative side and adaptable rectified point\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKPratama\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tD.-KKang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNeural Networks, and Complex Problem-Solving Technologies\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRobust optimization over multiple domains\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQQian\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSZhu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJTang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRJin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBSun\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHLi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\tthe AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCross-domain self-supervised multi-task feature learning using synthetic imagery\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZRen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYJLee\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\t\tthe IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n\nResults: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \niLearn: an integrated platform and meta-learner for feature engineering, machine-learning analysis and modeling of DNA, RNA and protein sequence data\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZChen\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1093/bib/bbz041\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBrief.

For each patient cohort, a decision analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions over a 5-year horizon. A Markov process was embedded in the decision model to simulate the possible prognosis of cancer. Data on transition probabilities, survival, side-effects, quality of life and costs were obtained from published sources and the SABR Commissioning through Evaluation (CtE) scheme. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with respect to quality-adjusted life-years. The robustness of the results was examined in a sensitivity analysis. Analyses were conducted from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective.\nResults\nIn the base case analysis, which assumed that all three interventions were associated with the same cancer progression rates and mortality rates, SABR was the most cost-effective intervention for both patient cohorts. This conclusion was sensitive to the cancer progression rate, mortality rate and cost of interventions. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probability that SABR is cost-effective was 57% and 50% in liver oligometastases and HCC, respectively.\nConclusions\nOur results indicate a potential for SABR to be cost-effective for patients with liver oligometastases and HCC. This finding supports further investigation in clinical trials directly comparing SABR with surgery and radiofrequency ablation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nReport of nationally representative values for the noninstitutionalized US adult population for 7 health-related quality-of-life scores\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJHanmer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWFLawrence\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPAnderson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMKaplan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGFryback\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMedical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making\n\t\t\n\t\t\t26\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRadiofrequency Ablation versus Liver Resection for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYHan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDYan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJQCai\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChinese medical journal\n\t\t\n\t\t\t129\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2016\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRadiofrequency Ablation versus Hepatic Resection for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials with Meta-Analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXDLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBMLuo\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRadiology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t287\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\t\t\n\t\n\tReferences of the tables 32\n\nExcerpt 2: \nReport of nationally 191 representative values for the noninstitutionalized US adult population for 7 health-related quality-of-192 life scores\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJHanmer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWFLawrence\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPAnderson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMKaplan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGFryback\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMedical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision\n\t\t\n\t\t\t193\n\t\t\t194\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\tMaking\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRadiofrequency Ablation versus Liver Resection for Colorectal 195 Cancer Liver Metastasis: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYHan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDYan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJQCai\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChinese medical journal\n\t\t\n\t\t\t196\n\t\t\t197\n\t\t\t2016\n\nExcerpt 3: \nResponsiveness of the generic EQ-5D 169 summary measure compared to the disease-specific EORTC QLQ C-30.

Material and Methods The retrospective study comprised 127 pregnant women with various pregnancy complications between 23 and 39 gestational weeks. Umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms were recorded with Doppler ultrasound and characterized by pulsatility index (PI) and blood flow class (BFC). Doppler audio signals were stored on a digital video recorder and the sound frequency at the energy level 15 dB below its peak (MAXpeak-15 dB) was estimated off-line. The prediction of probability for composite adverse pregnancy outcome (operative delivery for fetal distress, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death) was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Results With increasing umbilical artery BFC, the MAXpeak-15 dB frequencies decreased (p < 0.0001) and the PI increased (p < 0.0001). The ROC AUCs for adverse outcome for MAXpeak-15 dB and for PI were 0.842 and 0.836 (p = 0.88), respectively. For the combination of MAXpeak-15 dB and PI, the corresponding AUC was 0.894, significantly higher than that of PI (p < 0.03) and of MAXpeak-15 dB (p < 0.05). Conclusion Umbilical artery Doppler sound spectrum analysis might be a useful supplement to PI in the clinical evaluation of fetoplacental circulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUse of stereo earphones also allows differentiation between positive and negative (reverse) signals by ear. After the advent of modern ultrasound techniques combining high-resolution imaging, color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler, listening to the signals has been generally abandoned in favor of adjusting the recording situation and optimizing signals by visual control of the Doppler spectrum. Indeed, modern ultrasound systems do not provide an output for audible signals anymore and the quality of built-in loudspeakers is usually very poor.   The evaluation of Doppler sound signals by ear is very subjective, highly dependent on the skills and experience of the operator. Consequently, the subjective method is not suitable for more general application. Therefore, we have developed an objective method of analyzing Doppler audio signals and we have identified a new parameter characterizing the sound signalthe maximum frequency at the energy level that is 15 dB below the peak (MAX peak-15 dB ). This new characteristic of the sound signal proved to correlate very well with the subjective classification by operator, both for computer-simulated sound frequencies [22] and for umbilical artery signals recorded from sheep fetuses under various degrees of experimental asphyxia [9].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnalyses of the FFTs were done in the frequency range from 150 Hz, corresponding to the limit of earphones used by the sonographer, to 10,007 Hz, representing the frequency of the band stop of recording. An auditory feature, the high frequency cut-off band was identified within the frequency range [14]. Based on the results of our previous experimental study [9], this high-frequency cut-off (MAX peak-15 dB ) was defined as the frequency band where the energy level had decreased by 15 dB from its maximum level, i. e. from the MAX peak value ( \u2022 \" Fig. 1).The primary outcome variable was the composite adverse pregnancy outcome including perinatal death, operative delivery for fetal distress and admission for treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit. The risk for a negative outcome, given a certain value for artery PI, auditory parameter MAX peak-15 dB, or combination of PI and MAX peak-15 dB , was calculated using logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the areas under the curves (AUC) were used for characterization of the predictive performance of umbilical artery PI and of the auditory parameter MAX peak-15 dB .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, the Doppler examinations of umbilical and uteroplacental circulation were performed blindly without support of two-dimensional (2 D) ultrasound images, using a stand-alone either continuous or pulsed Doppler velocimeter with a pen probe [1, 6 -8]. The umbilical artery velocity signals were captured by listening to the Doppler signal, while adjustments of the insonation angle were performed. According to our experience, a skilled sonographer can perceive various timbres in the Doppler audio signals and distinguish different types of umbilical artery blood flow in fetuses with similar PI. Recently, we have developed and validated in an animal experimental model a method for objective analysis of the Doppler sound spectrum [9]. Subsequently, in a human pilot study, we compared the audio analysis and the traditional waveform analysis of umbilical artery Doppler signals before and after maternal steroid treatment [10]. The auditory parameter reflected the changes in the umbilical artery circulation more sensitively than the PI did.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Its main function modules include SD (sales and distribution), MM (material management), PP (production planning), PM (factory maintenance), HR (human resources), and FICO (finance and cost) [citaton 7].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene product SAP regulates signals induced through the co-receptor SLAM \nAbstract: In addition to triggering the activation of B- or T-cell antigen receptors, the binding of a ligand to its receptor at the cell surface can sometimes determine the physiological outcome of interactions between antigen-presenting cells, T and B lymphocytes. The protein SLAM (also known as CDw150), which is present on the surface of B and T cells, forms such a receptor-ligand pair as it is a self-ligand. We now show that a T-cell-specific, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which contains an SH2 domain and a short tall, acts as an inhibitor by blocking recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to a docking site in the SLAM cytoplasmic region. The gene encoding SAP maps to the same area of the X chromosome as the locus for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and we found mutations in the SAP gene in three XLP patients. Absence of the inhibitor SAP in XLP patients affects T/B-cell interactions induced by SLAM, leading to an inability to control B-cell proliferation caused by Epstein-Barr virus infections. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe design of these PCR primers was based on the genomic sequence of human SAP (EMBL database). The PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels, subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. For analysis of a point mutation in the region preceding exon 2, exon 2 PCR products were gel-puri\u00aeed (Qiagen) and digested with the restriction enzyme MnlI (New England Biolabs), followed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 200 volts for 3 h.

Human SAP cDNA was cloned in vector pGEX2T (Pharmacia) to generate a GST\u00b1SAP construct.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo con\u00aerm that the cDNAs were full-length, we also isolated cDNA clones from a human T-cell (Jurkat) library and from a murine (C57B16) thymus library. The predicted human SAP protein comprises a single SH2 domain (residues 6\u00b1102) followed by a short 26-aminoacid tail (residues 103\u00b1128). Human and murine SAP are highly homologous (96%) in both the SH2 and tail domains (Fig. 1). The SAP SH2 domain was clearly related to other SH2 domains, particularly those of SHIP (45%), EAT-2 (40%) and Abl (35%), but its short tail was unlike any known protein domain.Antibodies directed against human or mouse SAP-tail sequences detected a 15K protein in detergent lysates made from either human T cells (Fig. 2a) or murine thymocytes (Fig. 2b). Because the observed relative molecular mass was consistent with the predicted value, our human and mouse SAP cDNAs are unlikely to code for a fragment of a larger protein.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, overexpression of SAP in T cells has a positive effect on the co-stimulatory activity of anti-SLAM.\nDiscussionWe have identi\u00aeed the gene that is altered in XLP as SAP by using an indirect, functional approach.

However, the existing encryption methods cannot effectively solve the above problems when applied to WSN. To this end, according to WSN\u2019s characteristics and based on the identity-based encryption idea, an improved identity-based encryption algorithm (IIBE) is proposed, which can effectively simplify the key generation process, reduce the network traffic, and improve the network security. The design idea of this algorithm lies between the traditional public key encryption and identity-based public tweezers\u2019 encryption. Compared with the traditional public key encryption, the algorithm does not need a public key certificate and avoids the management of the certificate. Compared with identity-based public key encryption, the algorithm addresses the key escrow and key revocation problems. The results of the actual network distribution experiments demonstrate that IIBE has low energy consumption and high security, which are suitable for application in WSN with high requirements on security. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMulti-gateway-based energy holes avoidance routing protocol for WSN\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSRohini\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLDaya\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInformatics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2016\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA Fuzzy logic-based method to avert intrusions in wireless sensor networks using WSN-DS dataset\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNSingh\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDVirmani\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tX.-ZGao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications\n\t\t\n\t\t\t19\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t2050018\n\t\t\t2020\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDeep reinforcement learningbased optimization for cache-enabled opportunistic interference alignment wireless networks\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYHe\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFRYu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t66\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated networking, caching, and computing for connected vehicles: a deep reinforcement learning approach\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYHe\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNZhao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHYin\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t67\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2018\n\nExcerpt 2: \nusing bilinear pairings on elliptic curves\nTable 2 .2.e functions of each parameter are(1) Public parameter s: the public parameter is randomlygenerated by the server, not disclosed, only reservedby the server, and used to issue the node private key.However, participates in all encryption, decryption,and authentication operations thereafter [27].(2) Primitive element P: primitive element belongs to apoint in the finite field of elliptic curve, but it plays anextremely important role in IIBE algorithm, so it isan element alone.

High-resolution radars (HRRs) utilize wideband signals and synthetic apertures to enhance the range and angular resolutions of tracking, respectively. They also generate one-, two-, and even threedimensional high-resolution images containing the feature information of targets, from which the targets can be precisely classified and identified. Advanced signal processing algorithms in HRRs obtain important information such as range-Doppler imaging, phase-derived ranging, and micro-motion features. However, the advantages and applications of HRRs are restricted by factors such as the reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-scatter point targets, decreased tracking accuracy of multi-scatter point targets, high demands of motion compensation, and low sensitivity of the target attitude. Focusing on these problems, this paper systematically introduces the novel technologies of HRRs and discusses the issues and solutions relevant to detection, tracking, imaging, and recognition. Finally, it reviews the latest progress and representative results of HRR-based research, and suggests the future development of HRRs. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWhen designing classifiers at different levels, the classifier must be optimized by considering the physical meanings and statistical distributions of the features. For example, features such as target size and scattering center can be classified by a simple threshold discriminant classifier or a decision tree classifier, whereas the structural and statistical features of the scattering centers can be discriminated by a support vector machine classifier. Before making the final decision, the results of different classifiers can be combined by an ensemble classification method.  For adaptive feature extraction, we can exploit the end-to-end capability of deep neural networks. Deep learning avoids the high dependence of the traditional machine learning algorithm on human experience [118][119][120][121]. Deep neural networks include deep autoencoders, deep convolution neural networks, and deep recurrent neural networks. Among these, the deep convolution neural network is most commonly used. Figure 15 is a block diagram of HRRP recognition using a deep convolution neural network. The network includes a convolution layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The stacked convolution layer and pooling layer map the original data directly to the high-level abstract features, which are then mapped to the target through the fully connected layer. The entire process requires no human intervention.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRadar HRRP target recognition based on t-SNE segmentation and discriminant deep belief network\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMPan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQ PKong\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1109/LGRS.2017.2726098\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Geosci Remote Sens Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHRRP classification based on multi-scale fusion sparsity preserving projections\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWDai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tY\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tElectron Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t53\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBayesian spatiotemporal multitask learning for radar HRRP target recognition\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLDu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tP HWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1109/TSP.2011.2141664\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Trans Signal Process\n\t\t\n\t\t\t59\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe radar target recognition research based on improved neural network algorithm\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPPDuan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHLi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications (ISDEA)\n\t\tInternational Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications (ISDEA)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAutomatic target recognition of aircraft using inverse synthetic aperture radar\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCPenacaballero\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tECantu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJRodriguez\n\t\t\n\t\tArXiv:1711.04901\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTLong\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSci China Inf Sci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t62\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tApril 2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIdentification-while-scanning of a multi-aircraft formation based on sparse recovery for narrowband radar\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tS BPeng\n\t\t\n\t\t10.3390/s16111972\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSensors\n\t\t\n\t\t\t16\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2016\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Is required in a manner. The figure goes through attacks. In addition, the quiesical issue for additional time of pressure is that the auxiliary interaction of pressure occurs through the dewar receiving extra time. To address these issues, compressed sensing emerges, which packs the image into hours of sensing, is generated in an expedient manner that reduces time usage and saves the use of data transfer capability, however Bomb in transmission. A variety of examinations cleared a way for dealing with security issues in compressive sensing (CS) through giving security as an alternative negotiation. In addition, univariate factors opted for CS as the issue of rearranging image quality is because of the aggregation of clutter.

Moreover, Quizzical the problem for the additional time under compression results that, the secondary process of the compression followed through the acquisition consumes more time.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nHence, for resolving these issues, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged, which compressed the image at the time of sensing emerges as a speedy manner that reduces the time consumption and saves bandwidth utilization but fails under secured transmission.

Once preprocessed, the image gets formatted through various techniques, resulting under digital form. These digital signals consume large space and more time when it moves through a wireless channel (Yang et al., 2016). The following Figure 1 shows the image transmission process through the channel.The prepared sign should be reformatted during image handling to get the first transmitted image, yet this sign will likewise give repetitive data (Manapragada and Kluesing, 2014). It is additionally imperative to give an appropriate pressure procedure to take out such repetitive information (Qaisar et al., 2013).

It is known that \u03b8 is the probability of failure caused by the failure of the node itself in the system, \u03c1 is the failure probability caused by all the failures of the neighbor nodes in the system, and \u03b3 is the probability that any node in the system will leave the maximum connectivity graph of the network due to the failure, that is, the average failure of the node probability.The total number of offensive and defensive resources S A and S D are two key factors affecting the level of system vulnerability during the game phase. The sensitivity analysis of them is shown in Fig. 9.The simulation results and the analysis conclusions of this section can help guide the CPS defenders of the distribution network with distributed collaborative control mode and choose how to invest the appropriate amount of defense resources according to the CPS attack and defense environment.In the game phase, in addition to the influencing factors of the network attack and defense, the dynamic convergence process of the distributed collaborative control itself will also affect the system vulnerability assessment results.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn this article, it was named as time-dependent detection. The other type was cross validation through the correlation between the different sensors of the system to achieve the purpose of detection. This article named it space-dependent detection.\nB. Time-Dependent and Spatially Correlated Detection ModelsThe main members of the steel product traceability system include steel companies, distribution, product users, quality regulators, etc. The information of the steel enterprise includes the registration information of the enterprise, the raw material composition of the product, the production process data of the product, the product quality data, etc. The information of the distribution includes the batch, packaging, and the logistics date, etc. The information on the product user includes the required product category, use, quality traceability, etc. As a result, a part of the data relationship between the product manufacturing chain and the supply chain is shown in Fig. 2, and when a problem occurs at a node, the impact can be traced back or up along the data relationship network to improve the product supply and related dispute resolution efficiency.At present, the graph computing system generally adopts the node centered programming model or interface.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe following is a description of the influence mechanism through the simulation example and then the sensitivity analysis.  The simulation analysis of the impact of network attack time and control scheduling commands on the vulnerability of distribution network CPS.The simulation results are shown in Fig. 10, where the scheduling ratio is defined as the ratio of the reference power P ref to the maximum allowable output of the VPP, which shows that the VPP dynamically adjusts according to each control scheduling command, and the attack and defense game is performed at each moment. Corresponding system vulnerability: It can be seen from the figure that in the process of VPP accepting a certain instruction P ref scheduling, the system vulnerability changes obviously at the beginning stage and gradually becomes fixed after a period of time; meanwhile, as the P ref increases, the system vulnerability gradually increases. Upgrade: This is because under the new scheduling command, each DG will initially adjust its own output quickly, and P ref is positively correlated with the value of the scheduling command.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach. The experimental results confirm the fact that the proposed model performs better than the existing machine learning models. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nApart from the popular machine learning techniques extreme learning machine (ELM) and NSL knowledge discovery data mining have been identified as a standard for the evaluation of intrusion detection mechanisms in the network [7]. Researchers have also implemented random forest classifier on the IDS dataset sample. Such approaches have helped in the experimentation of datasets and analysing effects of malicious attacks considering various perspectives and dimensions [8].It is well known that applications of machine learning has a successful track record of automatically detecting and classifying intrusions both at network and host level in the quickest time frame. However, it is also essential to consider the volatility and ever changing characteristics of the malicious attacks involving larger volumes of stake holders. This issue needs to be resolved providing scalability. Moreover, the available datasets require continuous updates based on the dynamic characteristics of malware attacks. Several researchers have suggested the implementation of deep learning models and deep neural networks (DNN) for the development of flexible and dynamic IDS that would be capable of efficiently detecting and classifying capricious network attacks [9][10][11]. The results of the DNN model reveal potential of high dimensional feature representation of the IDS data when fed into hidden layers in comparison to the other machine learning approaches.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNIDS and HIDS sensors are resource expensive and impractical to be deployed covering the entire network. Inability to strategically optimize the usage of IDS could lead to important resources being exposed to adversarial attacks. Any IDS framework comes bundled with pre-defined signatures, which alert to any anomalies in the network traffic. However this framework needs to be customized to adhere to all possible organizational needs. Moreover, investigation of IDS alerts tend to be extremely resource intensive, and might require additional information from other network tools to confirm and decide on the seriousness of the alerts generated. These decisions require security expert personnel capable of the interpretation of system outputs and computing of crucial functions. Hence experienced security experts are required for the remediation, detection and management of such threats [3][4][5].As the dataset used in this work has huge dimension, an effective dimensionality reduction mechanism had to be developed to reduce the burden of the classifier. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction mechanism would facilitate the classifier to choose the most important attributes and eliminate the attributes that have negative impact on the performance of the classifiers. This motivated us to design a model making use of a PCA based firefly algorithm to effectively choose the most relevant attributes from the IDS dataset.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSince the approach provides visual detection of network intrusion it is justified as a real time solution for the deployment of intrusion detection system [14].Newer attacks pop up every day and identifying these attacks is a major challenge. Once the attacks have been identified, the IDS have to be fed in with appropriate responses, which constitute data gathering, feature selection and decision system. Deep learning is said to be one of the best approaches, which can be used in IDS due to the fact that its training duration is less and accuracy is better. The authors in [15] survey different deep learning approaches incorporated in IDS and present a comparative analysis of the same.Burstiness of data has been given a huge importance to information security so that the value of data can be used for business intelligence. The speed at, which the data is generated every second has made detection of attacks a challenging task. The authors in [16] have used Spark-Chi-SVM technique for intrusion detection. The authors also use ChiSqSelector for feature selection and a built-in intrusion detection technique is used with the help of support vector machine (SVM) classifier on Apache Spark Big Data platform.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The stable growth of migrant children, which affects the sustainable stability of the community, is adversely impacted by sustained pressures without adequate assistance and advice. Therefore, psychological stress from each post on microblog has been established through research focused on detecting migrant children. Nevertheless, after stressful times, it is more important to consider stress from aspect to recognize stressful periods and stressful incidents that cause each stressful period. This paper identifies the problem of the recognition of migrant children in the open social network microblog stressful periods and stressor events. Besides, the improved Poisson-dependent probability model has been developed and focused on the study of the postings of migrant children during stressful activities in schools to compare stressors with a set of postings on Tencent Weibo (microblog).

Firstly, the facial expression image is normalized, and the edge of each layer of the image is extracted in the convolution process. The extracted edge information is superimposed on each feature image to preserve the edge structure information of the texture image. Then, the dimensionality reduction of the extracted implicit features is processed by the maximum pooling method. Finally, the expression of the test sample image is classified and recognized by using a Softmax classifier. To verify the robustness of this method for facial expression recognition under a complex background, a simulation experiment is designed by scientifically mixing the Fer-2013 facial expression database with the LFW data set. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average recognition rate of 88.56% with fewer iterations, and the training speed on the training set is about 1.5 times faster than that on the contrast algorithm. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor more information, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ autistic children and help doctors understand themselves.

The possibility of severe vision loss can be extensively reduced by timely diagnosis and treatment. An automated screening for DR has been identified as an effective method for early DR detection, which can decrease the workload associated to manual grading as well as save diagnosis costs and time. Several studies have been carried out to develop automated detection and classification models for DR. This paper presents a new IoT and cloud-based deep learning for healthcare diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The proposed model incorporates different processes namely data collection, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. At first, the IoT-based data collection process takes place where the patient wears a head mounted camera to capture the retinal fundus image and send to cloud server. Then, the contrast level of the input DR image gets increased in the preprocessing stage using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) model. Next, the preprocessed image is segmented using Adaptive Spatial Kernel distance measure-based Fuzzy C-Means clustering (ASKFCM) model. Afterwards, deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based Inception v4 model is applied as a feature extractor and the resulting feature vectors undergo classification in line with the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model. The proposed model was tested using a benchmark DR MESSIDOR image dataset and the obtained results showcased superior performance of the proposed model over other such models compared in the study. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSeveral DLbased techniques are designed to examine the retinal fundus images and to develop automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models for DR [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22].A novel technology was designed in the literature [8] to determine the disease intensity under cloud and IoT applications. This technique was applied to predict the seriousness of the illness. The above technology was deployed to take unique care of student's and children's health. In this study, a programmatic health information, termed as student data, was created with the help of reputed UCI Repository as well as sensors employed in medical domain. This was deployed also to forecast diverse ailments which have been influenced by student with severity. Followed by, several other classification models were applied to predict different types of diseases. The major application of this algorithm is the determination of prediction accuracy using few attributes like F-measure, specificity as well as sensitivity.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdditionally, the proposed technique was defined with advanced techniques in IoT healthcare. A specific investigation was conducted to provide an overview of state-of-the-art network environment, applications as well as commercial increments in IoT-relied healthcare solutions.A modern clinical analysis system known to be neuro-fuzzy temporal data presentation method was presented in the previous study [17] to detect and diagnose diverse types of deadly diseases. Kakria et al. [18] employed a novel online health care observation technology to monitor the remote heart patients often using mobile phones and wearable sensors. Subsequently, Kim et al. [19] established a technique to monitor the emergency scenario under the application of content of motion tracking disease patients. Some other models are also found in Jebaseeli et al. [20]. Roychowdhury et al. [21] developed a new DREAM: Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Using Machine Learning model which investigates the fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view. The severity level of DR can be generated by the use of ML models such as Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe IoT-based CC would be expanded for developing new facilities and applications in a modern platform.Here, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered as the major reason for blindness even for people under the age group of 18-25 years [2]. DR is one of the fatal complications that affect diabetic patients. Being a complicated disease, DR cannot be recovered at the initial stages whereas diagnosis at the primary stage is a mandatory one. But, it brings a notable complexity to the entire health care department in the form of less availability of expert physicians while it affects a lot of patients. Another crucial factor associated in the prediction of DR is Optic Disc (OD) that undergoes characterization under the application of increased contrast among circular-shaped areas [3]. Here, OD is employed as a benchmark as well as a frame that is used to diagnose critical eye diseases like glaucoma, and to verify the emergence of neovascularization at OD. In addition, it has been applied to highlight the alternate structures like fovea. In normal retina, the edge of the OD is clear and well-defined.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To address these problems, we propose a new and robust Local Adjacent Extrema Pattern (LAEP) is a feature descriptor for fingerprint classification. The proposed descriptor finds it values based on indexes of local adjacent extremas using first order derivatives. The intensity values of the local extremas are compared with center pixel intensity value to employ the correlation of central pixel with its neighbors. Finally, the descriptor is generated on the support of the indexes and local extremas values. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for classification of fingerprint images into five classes. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor, we have tested on Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) - Indian rural fingerprint database for classification. In addition, the classification results of the proposed descriptor are compared with the existing methods. The resultant LAEP descriptor proved better classification accuracy than the previous methods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTo facilitate high performance classification, in this paper, we used only adjacent neighbours because it reduces the dimension of the descriptor and contain most of the local edge information.The remaining sections of this research paper include, section 2 proposes a descriptor based fingerprint classification model using local adjacent extrema pattern. Section 3 describes about SVM. Section 4 presents classification results and performance analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\nLocal Adjacent Extrema PatternLocal adjacent extrema pattern has derived as a new feature descriptor for fingerprint classification form center pixel and its local neighbours. The first order local adjacent derivative is used to extract the local adjacent extrema (maxima and minima) pattern. The connection of local adjacent extrema with the center pixel plays a major role to encode the LAEP descriptor. Local adjacent extrema are extracted of any center pixel by using first order local adjacent derivatives.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe resultant LAEP descriptor proved better classification accuracy than the previous methods.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIntroductionTo distinguish the human biometric security is known by two ways such as physical attributes and behavior. There have been different biometric traits were used for recognition. The biometric traits, for example: fingerprint, palm veins, iris recognition, retina, face recognition, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), palm print, hand geometry, odor, typing rhythm, gait, and voice which is very appropriate for human recognition because of their singularity, integrality and uniformity. Among all other biometric techniques, fingerprints have the elevated amount of dependability and widely utilized by criminological specialists as a part of criminal examinations. To maintain the security is computationally challenging task for large database. Hence, fingerprint indexing scheme is needed for match the query image against every one of the fingerprints in database.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSRDubey\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tS KSingh\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSingh\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Signal Proce Let\n\t\t\n\t\t\t22\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSMurala\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMaheshwari R P, Balasubramanian\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInt.

An energy efficient clustering method, depending on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the Fractional Artificial Bee Colony (FABC) algorithm, has a propensity to maximize the energy of the network and life time of nodes by the optimal cluster head selection (CHS). When conveying data, an ABC-Dynamic Scout bee algorithm is presented that multiplies the scout bee production to enlarge the number of alive nodes and the of CH energy. An assessment among the performances of the implemented ABC-based Dynamic Scout bee algorithm routing mechanism in opposition to that of ABC-based CHS and FABC-based CHS routing is done. The experimental outcome demonstrates that the implemented method increases the quantity of alive nodes with 25% of maximum energy for the normalized network compared with conventional protocols. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, the capability of the proposed ADCHS method is proved to be better when compared with the existing methods:% \u00f0 \u00de=\nCost function of the implemented technique \u00c0 Cost function of the conventional technique Cost function of the conventional technique \u00f020\u00deThe iteration is continued until it attains at the dead node. From Figure 5, the statistical analysis of the proposed ADCHS technique with respect to the number of nodes can be determined. From the analysis, it is known that the implemented method is 16.6% superior to the ACHS method and 22.2% superior to the FACHS technique. Hence, it is shown that the proposed ADCHS method offers an increased number of alive nodes with an  increase in the number of nodes. Similarly, from Figure 6, the normalized network energy in terms of the number of rounds is obtained. From the analysis, it is known that the implemented ADCHS technique is 20% better than both the ACHS and FACHS methods.Figure 7 shows the statistical analysis of the implemented ADCHS algorithm and conventional ACHS and FACHS algorithms, by considering the CH count that is selected at each particular round.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe model related with the WSN demonstrates the model plot for 0-2000 rounds, and it is carried out by fixing the values as in the conventional technique 21 ; 50/100 amount of sensor nodes with an primary energy E i , 0.5 and E fs of 10pJ=bit=m 2 . The transmitter (E pa ) energy that the power amplifier shows is 0:0013pJ=bit=m 2 , the value of data aggregation energy E da is 5nJ=bit=signal, and the transmitting energy E Tx is 50nJ=bit=m 2 . Subsequent to these values, the model is implemented until it arrives at dead nodes.\nStatistical analysisIn this section, the statistical analysis of the conventional and the implemented system is analyzed depending on the two factors, namely, energy and distance by means of the fitness parameter. Figure 4 demonstrates the convergence graph concerning the number of iterations. From Figure 4, the convergence analysis for the proposed ADCHS method concerning the number of iteration is 8.3% better than the ACHS method and 2.7% better than the FACHS method.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n309952980.3030061000980.226638970.225842980.218476\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFundingThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAuthor biographiesAchyut Shankar obtained the BE&ME in CSE from Dr MGR University and SRM University in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTeaching sustainability in European higher education institutions: assessing the connections between competences and pedagogical approaches\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRLozano\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMBarreiro-Gen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFJLozano\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKSammalisto\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSustainability\n\t\t\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t1602\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPleistocene Arctic megafaunal ecological engineering as a natural climate solution?\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMMacias-Fauria\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPJepson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNZimov\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYMalhi\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPhilos.

To decrease the time cost in manual work, text classification techniques are applied to automatically identify severity of bug reports. In this paper, we address the problem of low-quality and class imbalance for identifying the severity of bug reports. First, we combine feature selection with instance selection to simultaneously reduce the bug report dimension and the word dimension, which could get small-scale and high-quality reduced data set. Then, an improve random oversampling technique, named, RSMOTE, which is presented to weaken the imbalancedness degree of class distribution. Finally, to avoid the random over-sampling uncertainty of RSMOTE, we develop an ensemble learning algorithm, which is based on Choquet fuzzy integral, to combine multiple RSMOTE. We empirically investigate the performance of data reduction on ten data sets of three large open source projects, namely, Eclipse, Mozilla, and GNOME. The results show that our approach can effectively reduce the data scale and improve the performance of identifying the severity of bug reports. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nXu [27] uses seven approaches to reduce the dimension of dataset, which could improve the performance of classification results. Yang et al. [29] uses three commonly feature selection, IG, CHI, Correlation Coefficient to reduce the noise from 4 opensource components from Eclipse and Mozilla. Zhang [3958] represents a concept profile-based approach to assign the severity of bug reports. They build the concept profiles based on historical bug reports. Then, the new bug reports come, they assign the severity of new coming bug report by measuring the similarity and severity concepts.\nVI. CONCLUSIONIn the context of software maintenance, a bug with high severity is typically associated with fatal errors and crashes. Therefore, the automatic prediction of the severity of bug reports could considerably reduce manpower requirements and improve the efficiency of bug resolution. However, two challenges often arise during the automated technique to identify the severity of bug reports: (1) high-dimensionality (both bug reports and words) is found in most bug repositories, and (2) class imbalance occurs for those datasets. In this paper, we address the problem of data reduction and data imbalance distribution for identify the severity of bug reports.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n61672122\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t61602077\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t61771087\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20170005\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20170540097\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3132016348\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3132018194\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tACAIM20180001\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDiscernibility matrix simplification with new attribute dependency functions for incomplete information systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGLang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLGuo\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tKnowl.

In this work, we present a cost-effective route to synthesize the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite by using cheap metal hydrides and aluminum chloride as starting reagents and to achieve liquid state reactive milling. The LiH/AlCl3 and MgH2/AlCl3 reaction systems were systemically explored. The phase identification of the obtained products was carried out by XRD and the morphology observed by TEM characterization. It was found that the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite can be successfully synthesized by reactive milling of commercial AlCl3 and LiH in a neutral ionic liquid ([2-Eim] OAc). Based on XRD analysis and TEM observation, an average grain size of 56 nm can be obtained by the proposed mechanochemical process. By setting the isothermal dehydrogenation temperature between 80 and 160 \u00b0C, the as-synthesized \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite exhibits an advantage in hydrogen desorption capacity and has fast dehydriding kinetics. The hydrogen desorption content of 9.93 wt% was achieved at 160 \u00b0C, which indicates the potential utilization of the prepared nanocomposite in hydrogen storage applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFMBrower\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNEMatzek\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPFReigler\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWRinn\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCBRoberts\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDLSchmidt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJASnover\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKTerada\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

Most importantly, various hydrogen storage materials, such as the light metal hydride and their complexes, have been extensively explored over the recent years. 1, 2 Among these materials, aluminium hydride (AlH 3 ) is one of the most promising candidates due to its high theoretical hydrogen storage capacity (10.08 wt. %) and low decomposition temperature (100-200 \u00b0\u0421). [3][4][5][6][7][8] Compared to other metal hydride or hydrogen storage materials, AlH 3 is an ideal candidate for a wide array of applications, such as solid rocket propellant and hydrogen-fuel cells. [9][10][11] Hence, several research groups have investigated the synthesis methods and hydrogenstorage performance of AlH 3 polymorphs.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis solid state mechanochemical method has also been adopted for use by other researchers to produce nanosized \u03b1-AlH 3 composite. [27][28][29][30][31] Because of its widespread use, it is evident that mechanochemical method is a valid and wellestablished method for the synthesis of nano-sized \u03b1-AlH 3 composite. However, it has been reported that the metallic Al forms during the room temperature ball milling, which can be partially attributed to the heterogeneity of solid-state reaction and leads to the decomposition of AlH 3 . Though the cryo-milling process has the potential to prevent the AlH 3 from dehydriding, the much lower temperature also raises technical challenges on large-scale production of \u03b1-AlH 3 . Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as promising environmentfriendly solvents in organic synthesis and offer distinct advantages, such as non-flammability, low volatility, low toxicity and high thermal and chemical stability. 32, 33 ILs are also extremely important because they can be used as a solvent in catalyst-free reactions.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In present work, a convenient and cost-efficient solid-state mechanochemical reaction is proposed to obtain \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite. With the addition of TiF3, \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite was formed in a short period by milling of LiH and AlCl3. Based on XRD and NMR results, the average grain size of the \u03b1-AlH3 in the nano-composite was 45\u2009nm. The reaction pathway as well as the synergistic effect of TiF3 on the solid state reaction between LiH and AlCl3 were confirmed. In the \u03b1-AlH3/LiCl nano-composite, TiF3 reduced the temperature of dehydriding reaction and improved dehydrogenation rate of \u03b1-AlH3. Within the temperature range between 80 and 160\u2009\u00b0C, dehydrogenation of the as-milled \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite showed fast kinetics. At 160\u2009\u00b0C, a maximum hydrogen desorption of 9.92\u2009wt% was obtained within 750\u2009s, very close to the theoretical hydrogen capacity of \u03b1-AlH3. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nConcise chemistry modulation of the SMM behavior within a family of mononuclear Dy (III) complexes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXMa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWYuan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInorg.

Using this approach, patients with myocardial infarction can be differentiated from those with unstable angina. The present study aims to develop an integrated model, based on the feature selection and classification, for the automatic classification of ACS.\nMethods: A dataset containing medical records of 809 patients suspected to suffer from ACS was used. For each subject, 266 clinical factors were collected. At first, a feature selection was performed based on interviews with 20 cardiologists; thereby 40 seminal features for classifying ACS were selected. Next, a feature selection algorithm was also applied to detect a subset of the features with the best classification accuracy. As a result, the feature numbers considerably reduced to only seven. Lastly, based on the seven selected features, eight various common pattern recognition tools for classification of ACS were used.\nResults: The performance of the aforementioned classifiers was compared based on their accuracy computed from their confusion matrices. Among these methods, the multi-layer perceptron showed the best performance with the 83.2% accuracy.\nConclusion: The results reveal that an integrated AI-based feature selection and classification approach is an effective method for the early and accurate classification of ACS and ultimately a timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPattern analysis for machine olfaction: a review\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRGutierrez-Osuna\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSensors Journal\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2002\n\t\t\n\t\n\tIEEE\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tANFIS: adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJsrJang\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern\n\t\t\n\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1993\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPredicting corporate financial distress based on integration of decision tree classification and logistic regression\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMYChen\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tExpert Syst Appl\n\t\t\n\t\t\t38\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tClassification and regression trees\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLBreiman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1984\n\t\t\tChapman & Hall\n\t\t\tLondon\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tReusable components in decision tree induction algorithms\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSuknovic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBDelibasic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJovanovic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVukicevic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDBecejski-Vujaklija\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZObradovic\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComput Stat\n\t\t\n\t\t\t27\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2012\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA logical sequence of questions) extracted from the training data [9,21]. A new case can be classified by starting at the root of the tree and moving through it until a leaf is encountered. Decision trees have become one of the most widely applied methods among numerous classification approaches, because these are white box models with easy-to-interpret results. In addition, its construction does not need any domain knowledge or parameter setting and thus is appropriate for exploratory knowledge discovery [22,23]. ID3 is one of the major algorithms of decision tree which was used in this study.\nBagging-ID3Bagging (Bootstrap aggregating) is a popular approach proposed by Bremen [24,25] which is considered as an ensemble meta-algorithm to build classification models. This resampling-based technique can be incorporated into various classification algorithms or regression methods. This incorporation resulted in reducing the variance associated with the prediction models, and thereby improves the predictive performance of these models. Bagging consists of creating numerous bootstrap replicates of the learning set by drawing \"B\" simple random samples with replacement (bootstrap samples) from the learning set and using these as new learning sets.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nof Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty of Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Putra Malaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSerdang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSelangor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty of Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Putra Malaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSerdang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSelangor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaridNajafi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biostatistics and Epidemiology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Public Health\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah University of Medical Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biostatistics and Epidemiology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Public Health\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah University of Medical Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeenakshiiNallappan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty of Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Putra Malaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSerdang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSelangor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty of Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Putra\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Studies show different and inconsistent prevalence rates in Iran. This study aims to determine the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult through a meta-analysis approach.\nMethods: The present meta-analysis was conducted between January 2000-August 2019. Articles related to the subject matter were obtained by searching Scopus, Sciencedirect, SID, magiran, Barakat Knowledge Network System, Medline (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases. The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using I2 index and the data were analyzed in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.\nResults: In a study of 3948 individuals aged 50-90 years, the overall prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult was 8.2% (95% CI, 4.14-6.3%) based on meta-analysis. Also, in order to investigate the effects of potential factors (sample size and year of study) on the heterogeneity of severe depression in Iranian older adult, meta-regression was used. It was reported that the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult decreased with increasing sample size and increasing years of the study, which is significantly different (P < 0.05).\nConclusion: Considering the high prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult, it is necessary for health policy makers to take effective control measures and periodic care for the older adult. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMethodsThis study is a meta-analysis, based on the findings of studies on the prevalence of severe depression among Iranian older adult, including articles published in domestic and foreign journals and searches carried out in the databases of Sciencedirect, Scopus, SID, magiran, Medline (PubMed), Barakat Knowledge Network System, and Google Scholar between January 2000 to August 2019. The search process was carried out using the keywords Older adult, Depression, Mood Disorders, Types of Depression, Severe Depression and their English equivalents and their possible combinations, search engine using both English and Persian words and (AND) and (OR) operators were used in combination to provide more comprehensive access to all articles, therefore, the OR operator was used to check for common names for disorders such as (Older adult OR Aging), (depression OR Depressive Disorder), (mood disorders OR Affective Disorders). The AND operator was also used among the keywords (Older adult AND depression AND severe depression) by matching words in the MeSH browser.\nEvaluation of articles and quality controlAll articles were first collected using the selected keywords and a list of abstracts was prepared after the search was completed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nof Nursing and Midwifery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah University of Medical Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Nursing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Nursing and Midwifery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah University of Medical Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlirezaAbdi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Nursing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Nursing and Midwifery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah University of Medical Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Nursing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Nursing and Midwifery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah University of Medical Sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKermanshah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShamarinaShohaimi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Biology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty of Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity Putra Malaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSerdang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSelangor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalaysia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBehnamKhaledipaveh\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDepartment of Psychiatric Nursing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchool of Nursing and\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[35] and Koshyar et al.

This association is so conspicuous in the case of bees that other groups of potential pollinators, especially flies, have long been underestimated. However, visitors are not always pollinators. While the importance of flies in plant-visitor networks is now acknowledged, their pollination effectiveness has hardly been investigated. In this study, we assessed the pollination effectiveness of Geranium sylvaticum flower-visitors using single-visit seed set experiments, in a subalpine meadow where flies are predominant. We found that: (i) empidine dance flies were the most frequent visitors of G. sylvaticum; (ii) a single-visit by an empidine dance fly produced the same average number of seeds as a visit by a bee; (iii) large pollinators were more efficient than small pollinators irrespective of their identity. As a conclusion, large empidines were the main pollinators of G. sylvaticum. Considering the high diversity and abundance of flower-visiting fly species, such results showing their ability to be as effective pollinators as bees should encourage further studies to develop a better understanding on their role in plant-pollinator networks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThey are obligate floral-visitors with more than 2000 described species worldwide which, contrary to the commonly accepted assumptions that they are generalists and poor pollinators, could reveal high levels of specialization and the same pollination efficiency as bees. Their high abundance and diversity throughout the favourable season suggest that they are important pollinators in mountains and at high latitudes [14]. Like empidine dance flies, numerous species of calliphorids, conopids, muscids, anthomyids, tabanids and many other fly families depend on nectar and pollen for feeding.In habitats where bees are unable to thrive, flies often represent the predominant biotic vector carrying pollen grains from one flower to another, and therefore the main potential pollinators. Funding.   royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsbl Biol. Lett.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nUntil recently, most of the studies addressing the role of insects as pollinators focused on bees, but the awareness of the collapse of their populations has sparked a growing interest in other flower-visiting insects (non-bee Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera) as potential pollinators [3]. However even in agricultural landscapes, where wild insects have proven efficient pollinators by increasing fruit set independently of honeybees' abundance [4], studies measuring pollination effectiveness of non-bee flower-visiting insects are very scarce. Consequently, despite the proliferating new knowledge on flower-visitor networks, the actual role played by most anthophilous insects in the pollination of flowering plants remains largely unknown.Flies (Diptera) represent the most conspicuous group of flower-visitors and potential pollinators after bees [5][6][7], especially in cool to cold habitats of high altitude or latitude where wild bees become naturally scarcer [8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. However, most studies including dipterans address only flower visitation frequencies, which King et al. [15] consider a poor proxy for pollinator effectiveness.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSize of the visitor had a significant effect, as visits by large-sized flies and bees (greater than or equal to 10 mm) produced more seeds than visits by smaller ones (F 1,27 = 5.25, p = 0.03; figure 2). Taxonomic group (bee or empidine) and duration of the visit did not influence the seed set, although the average duration of visits by empidines (335 \u00b1 60 s) was much longer than the average duration of visits by bees (54 \u00b1 17 s).\nDiscussion (a) Insect visitation to Geranium sylvaticum is necessary for pollinationOur results confirm that sexual reproduction of G. sylvaticum depends on flower-visiting insects, as flowers under the autofertility treatment produced no seed. This is likely due to the protandry of the flowers, as this plant species was reported to be self-compatible [21]. Among its visitors, empidine dance flies were the most frequent. The proportions of flies (80.6%) and empidines (74.2%) that visited G. sylvaticum were consistent with the results of a previous study conducted in 2012 in the same area [13].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Females may compensate for their loss of male fitness by reallocating resources from male function (pollen production and pollinator attraction) to female function (seeds and fruits), thus increasing seed production. Females may also benefit from their inability to self-fertilize if selfing and inbreeding depression reduce seed quality in hermaphrodites. We investigated how differences in floral resource allocation (flower size) between female and hermaphroditic plants affect two measures of female reproductive success, pollinator visitation and pollen receipt, in gynodioecious populations of Geranium richardsonii in Colorado. Using emasculation treatments in natural populations, we further examined whether selfing by autogamy and geitonogamy comprises a significant proportion of pollen receipt by hermaphrodites. Flowers of female plants are significantly smaller than those of hermaphrodites. The reduction in allocation to pollinator-attracting structures (petals) is correlated with a significant reduction in pollinator visitation to female flowers in artificial arrays. The reduction in attractiveness is further manifested in significantly less pollen being deposited on the stigmas of female flowers in natural populations. Autogamy is rare in these protandrous flowers, and geitonogamy accounts for most of the difference in pollen receipt between hermaphrodites and females. Female success at receiving pollen was negatively frequency dependent on the relative frequency of females in populations. Thus, two of the prerequisites for the maintenance of females in gynodioecious populations, differences in resource allocation between floral morphs and high selfing rates in hermaphrodites, occur in G. richardsonii. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch protandry suggests that avoidance of selfing has been a strong selection pressure in the evolution of G. richarsonii's floral biology and mating system. Selfing can depress fitness in both self-compatible and self-incompatible species due to inbreeding depression and interference between self-and outcross pollen, respectively (reviewed by de Jong et al., 1993;Snow et al., 1996). Kearns (1990) inferred that G. richardsonii was self-incompatible or required a minimum threshold quantity of pollen for successful self-fertilization based on a limited number of hand crosses. Recent hand pollination experiments (K. O'Malley, C. Williams, and M. Kuchenreuther, unpublished data) have shown that G. richardsonii does self and suffers inbreeding depression in fruit and seed set.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRAFisher\n\t\t\n\t\tThe genetical theory of natural selection\n\t\tOxford, UK\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOxford University Press\n\t\t\t1930\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe relationship of plant size to self-pollination in Mertensia ciliata\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMAGeber\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEcology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t66\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1985\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPollen dispersal and mating patterns in animal pollinated plants\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLDHarder\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSC HBarrett\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFloral biology: studies on floral evolution in animal-pollinated plants\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDGLloyd\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSC HBarrett\n\t\t\n\t\tNew York, New York, USA\n\t\t\n\t\t\tChapman and Hall\n\t\t\t1996\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tML HKaul\n\t\t\n\t\tMale sterility in higher plants\n\t\tBerlin, Germany\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpringer-Verlag\n\t\t\t1988\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCAKearns\n\t\t\n\t\tThe role of fly pollination in montane habitats\n\t\tMaryland, USA\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1990\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUniversity of Maryland, College Park\n\t\t\n\t\n\tPh.D. dissertation\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPlant breeding systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJRichards\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1986\n\t\t\tAllen and Unwin\n\t\t\tLondon, UK\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA model for the estimation of outcrossing rates and gene frequencies using n independent loci\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKRitland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSKJain\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHeredity\n\t\t\n\t\t\t47\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1981\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe relationship between floral display size, pollen carryover and geitonogamy in Myosotis colensoi (Kirk) McBride (Boraginaceae)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAWRoberston\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBiological Journal of the Linnean Society\n\t\t\n\t\t\t46\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1992\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe evolution of gynodioecy and subdioecy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMDRoss\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEvolution\n\t\t\n\t\t\t32\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1978\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, identifying epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs and characterizing their functional mechanisms in different cancer subtypes are still major challenges for cancer studies. In this study, we systematically analyzed the epigenetic alterations of lncRNAs at important regulatory elements in three breast cancer subtypes. We identified 87, 691, and 1,197 epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs in luminal, basal, and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, respectively. The landscape of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements revealed that epigenetic changes of the majority of lncRNAs occurred in a subtype-specific manner and contributed to subtype-specific biological functions. We identified six acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27ac)-dysregulated lncRNAs and three DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs (CTC-303L1.2, RP11-738B7.1, and SLC26A4-AS1) as prognostic biomarkers of basal subtype. These lncRNAs were involved in immune response-related biological functions. Treatment of the basal breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 with CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors downregulated H3K27 acetylation levels and caused a decrease in the expression of five H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs (LINC00393, KB-1836B5.1, RP1-140K8.5, AC005162.1, and AC020916.2) and inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells. One epigenetically dysregulated lncRNA (LINC01983) and four lncRNA regulators (UCA1, RP11-221J22.2, RP11-221J22.1, and RP1-212P9.3) were identified as prognostic biomarkers of the luminal molecular subtype of breast cancer by controlling the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation, and T cell migration. Finally, our results highlighted a profound role of enhancer-related H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs, DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs, and lncRNA regulators in breast cancer subtype carcinogenesis and their potential prognostic value. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS2A). These results suggest that lncRNAs with complex splicing patterns are more likely regulated by aberrant epigenetic modifications.In addition, we compared the expression level and expression variation of epi-lncRNAs with other lncRNAs to characterize the expression pattern of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess expression variation of genes among patients with breast cancer. lncRNAs showed substantially lower expression levels than did PCGs in all three breast cancer subtypes, which has been described in previous studies. 17 Interestingly, epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs displayed substantially higher expression levels and lower expression variation compared with other lncRNAs in all three breast cancer subtypes (p < 0.05). Consistently, we observed higher expression levels and lower expression variation of epigenetically dysregulated PCGs compared with other PCGs in the basal and claudin-low subtypes (p < 0.05; Figure S2B). These results suggest that epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs are stably expressed in breast cancer subtypes and may be suitable as potential biomarkers for breast cancer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nGRINA,LITAF, ADAM20, VAMP8, CHRNA3, URI1,STXBP5L, ZKSCAN1IRS1, ABHD2, HMGB1, CALML3, SLC4A7,ADAM23, TBXA2R, CFB, VDAC3, EVI2A,BUB1B, GPR65, ADAMTS2, TNFRSF10A,2KCNC4-AS1RIN1, TPP1, ABCD2, IFIT3, SCN4B, ZNF256,CPB1, RBM4, NPIPA1, LIG4, DGKQ, GRINA,LITAF, ADAM20, VAMP8, CHRNA3, URI1,STXBP5L, ZKSCAN1, GBF1IRS1, ABHD2, HMGB1, CALML3, SLC4A7,ADAM23, TBXA2R, CFB, VDAC3, EVI2A,BUB1B, GPR65, ADAMTS2, TNFRSF10A,RIN1, TPP1, ABCD2,\n\nExcerpt 3: \nepi-lncRNAs in the claudin-low subtype were mainly regulated by H3K27ac (78.27%) and H3K27me3 (14.98%) at enhancer elements (60.85%), which affected a large number of basic biological functions, including macromolecule metabolism, cellular macromolecule biosynthesis, and cellular protein modification processes (Figure 2C). Overall, epi-lncRNAs in breast cancer subtypes were mainly associated with H3K27ac dysregulation (67.16%) within enhancer elements (Figure 2D). However, lncRNAs with H3K27ac dysregulation affected different biological functions in different breast cancer subtypes, such as the necroptotic process in the luminal subtype, cell communication, cell proliferation, and immune system processes in the basal subtype, and macromolecule biosynthetic and protein modification processes in the claudin-low subtype (Figure 2D).We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using Euclidean distance for breast cancer samples based on the expression of these lncRNAs to further characterize the important role of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The first targeted therapy, sorafenib, prolonged the overall survival by months. However, resistance often occurs, largely limits its efficacy. Sorafenib was found to target the electron transport chain complexes, which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain sorafenib resistance and further facilitate tumor progression, cancer cells develop strategies to overcome excessive ROS production and obtain resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we investigated the roles of ROS in sorafenib resistance, and found suppressed ROS levels and reductive redox states in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells maintained greater functional and morphological integrity under the treatment of sorafenib. However, cellular oxygen consumption rate and mitochondria DNA content analyses revealed fewer numbers of mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells. Further investigation attributed this finding to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, likely caused by the accelerated degradation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC1\u03b2). Mechanistic dissection showed that upregulated UBQLN1 induced PGC1\u03b2 degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner to attenuate mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS production in sorafenib-resistant cells under sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, clinical investigations further indicated that the patients with higher UBQLN1 levels experienced worse recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, we propose a novel mechanism involving mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS homeostasis in sorafenib resistance, which may offer new therapeutic targets and strategies for HCC patients. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInactivation of PHGDH increases ROS levels and induces apoptosis in HCC cells upon sorafenib treatment. A lower mitochondrial volume is associated with the Warburg effect, which also contributes to tumor progression, 44 as well as being a critical metabolic characteristic of cell stemness restoration, 45 while both stemness maintenance and the Warburg effect contribute to sorafenib resistance. 46,47 Another recent study 48 suggested that mitochondrial TXNRD3 confers drug resistance via a redox-mediated mechanism, further supporting the findings of our current study. In addition, the alterations of biological redox couples vary in different cell lines, suggesting a cell line-specific, but generally reductive reprogramming in sorafenib-resistant cells and OE-PGC1\u03b2 cells, compared with their controls.Mitochondrial biogenesis is a complex process. 21 Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the transcriptional family of PGC1, which is composed of PGC1\u03b1, PGC1-related coactivator, and PGC1\u03b2. These proteins interact with other transcription factors involved in mitochondrial gene expression to regulate genes encoding proteins Fig. 5 The role of UBQLN1 regulated PGC1\u03b2 degradation in sorafenib resistance.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAccelerated PGC1\u03b2 degradation inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation in sorafenib-resistant cells Cells have developed finely tuned and complex mechanisms to adapt to stress conditions and metabolic demand alterations by modulating mitochondrial number and function. 30 Mitochondria and cellular homeostasis are accurately coordinated by mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the reduced mitochondrial content in resistant cells, we first evaluated mitochondria degradation. Mitophagy is a principle mechanism for mitochondria degradation and reduction of ROS stress. 31 We measured mitophagy levels in parental and resistant cells, and found that LC3II (reflects autophagic activity) levels were lower in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, with or without chloroquine (a classic inhibitor of autophagy that alters the acidic environment of lysosomes thus blocks the binding of autophagosomes to lysosomes; Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, levels of the mitophagy-specific markers PARKIN and PINK were also reduced in resistant cells (Fig. 3c,d). Fluorescence imaging further revealed a lower autophagic flux in resistant cells than parental cells under sorafenib treatment (Fig. 3e).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3e). These results indicated that mitophagy was decreased in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, which is unlikely to explain the lower mitochondrial content in resistant cells.We next examined mitochondrial biogenesis in the pairs of HCC cell lines. The PGC1 family of transcriptional coactivators act as master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, with PGC1\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b2 regulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) to maintain mtDNA levels and mitochondrial function. 32 Thus, we first evaluated PGC1\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b2 protein levels, and found that PGC1\u03b2 expression was reduced in the resistant cell lines, while little change was observed with PGC1\u03b1 expression (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of TFAM were also decreased in resistant cells compared with those in parental cells (Fig. 3g), and overexpressing PGC1\u03b2 in resistant cells increased TFAM mRNA levels (Fig. 3h) and ROS production in response to sorafenib (Fig. 3i,j).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion-anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep-charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion-anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof-of-concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium-based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 , and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHitherto, an empirical design strategy that using graphite with high graphitization degree and large area of the \"non-basal plane\" is considered as the effective way to boost the anion storage of graphite. [9a, 11] Accordingly, a common practice to reduce the diffusion resistance of anions is to design defect-free and/or few-layer graphite cathodes. [12] Although the strategy enhances the intercalation kinetics of anions to some extent, [12a-d] the practical specific capacity of graphite cathodes for anion storage still remains as a bottleneck. In this regard, it is of great significance to obtain further fundamental insights into the anion storage behavior for the sake of addressing the capacity bottleneck of graphite cathodes.In this work, we proposed an unconventional design strategy by employing locally ordered graphite carbon (LOGC) interconnected with disordered carbon as the anion-intercalating cathode, in order to overcome the capacity limit of defect-free graphite.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCYang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJChen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXJi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTPPollard\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXL\u00fc\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tC.-JSun\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSHou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTQing\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOBorodin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYRen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKXu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCWang\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/s41586-019-1175-6\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t569\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2019\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNLi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYBTang\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1039/C8TA07987K\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety. However, the poor processibility and relatively low ionic conductivity of Na+ and K+ ions limit the further practical applications of ISEs. PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na+ /K+ ion transfer is summarized. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/KIBs based on PEs are presented. Finally, some suggestions and perspectives are put forward to provide some possible directions for the follow-up researches. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[91] Furthermore, iv) PEs take advantage of good interfacial contact and electrochemical compatibility over ISEs because the natural rigidity of the latter generally results in the presence of interfacial gaps and resultantly poor interfacial contact between electrolyte and electrodes. v) PEs are more conducive to realizing high ionic conductivity for the transfer of Na + ions and K + ions at room temperature or even at low temperature than ISEs, due to the large ionic radii of active ions and different ion migration mechanism between PEs and ISEs. [92] vi) PEs also have some other merits of lightweight, high-volume utilization, and good film-forming ability. [90] To further improve the electrochemical properties of PEs, it is of significance to get fundamental insight into the migration mechanism and transfer kinetics of active ions in PEs. It is generally accepted that the Li + -ion migration in PEs is affected by the fracture/formation of coordination bonds in the segmented movement of polymer chains, which mainly occurs in the amorphous region of the polymer matrices.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[91] Reverse movement of anions without being deposited on the electrodes can cause concentration polarization, which results in increased internal impedances and reduced discharge voltages. Single ion conductive PE is used to limit the anion and increase the cation conductivity by covalently binding the anion to the polymer chain or adding an anion acceptor.

However, note that different from in \"rocking-chair\" battery systems, in a DIB system, active ions include both cations and anions, which needs a comparable ion transfer kinetics for cations and anions. 3. Appropriate mechanical strength: Good mechanical properties enable the suppression of the dendrite growth, and at the same time, it cannot be as fragile as some inorganic solid electrolytes, which have seldom relaxation elasticity under pressure.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[52] The selection of solvent components plays a key role in the formation of SEI. Therefore, the solvation effect is directly related to the ionic transfer kinetics in batteries.Further, the growth of dendrites and the flammability of electrolytes have raised serious safety concerns of batteries. A better fluidity of electrolytes enables faster transfer of ions and better interface infiltration as well, [53] which ensures the contact between electrode and electrolyte. In this regard, liquid-phase electrolytes show an obvious superiority over solid-phase electrolytes. When electrolyte changes from the liquid-phase to quasi-/solid phase, the interfacial contact becomes the main challenge; however, the enhanced mechanical strength and nonleakage nature is conducive to inhibiting the growth of dendrites and improving the safety (Figure 2c). [54,55] Accordingly, it is of great significance to choose a suitable electrolyte for batteries.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Dovefoot Geranium is a low-growing herb with pink flowers and sharply toothed leaves. Dovefoot Geranium is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to many habitats of the world. This species is very similar to G. robertianum but its palmate-like leaves and bilobed petals show differences. This plant is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. We have no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Therefore, due to the importance of these plant species, we performed a combination of morphological and molecular data for this species. For this study, we used 132 randomly collected plants from 18 geographical populations in 4 provinces. Genetic diversity parameters were determined in these populations. STRUCTURE analysis and K-Means clustering identified 14 gene pools in the country and revealed isolation by distance among the studied populations. The Mantel test showed correlation between genetic and geographical distance. AMOVA revealed a significant genetic difference among populations and showed that 40% of total genetic variation was due to within-population diversity. The consensus tree of both molecular and morphological data identified divergent populations. These data may be used in future breeding and conservation of this important medicinal plant in the country. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBut it is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. It has minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and fibre.Molecular markers are useful in identifying the maximally diverse parental genotypes through an evaluation of genetic diversity which is useful in cultivar identification and breeding. Among the various molecular markers, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) are simple and quick techniques and have become popular as their application does not need any prior information about the target sequences in the genome, high-efficiency and sharp sensibility, and these techniques have now been widely used for line identification and genetic diversity. These markers have been used in DNA fingerprinting, conservation biology, identification and determination of species relationships in many plants [16,17]. G. molle grows in different regions of Iran and comprises many local geographical populations. Therefore, the present study was performed for the first time in the country to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of these local populations. The results of present study may have positive effect on conservation strategy and future breeding of this medicinally important plant.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe quality of extracted DNA was examined by running on 0.8% agarose gel. 10 ISSR primers; (AGC) 5 GT, (CA) 7 GT, (AGC) 5 GG, UBC810, (CA) 7 AT, (GA) 9 C, UBC807, UBC811, (GA) 9 T and (GT) 7 CA commercialized by UBC (the University of British Columbia) were used.

The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n20 \nInfluence of JP on bacterial diversityThe high-quality clean reads were >98.50% for all six samples, indicating a good sequencing depth for fecal microbiota gene analysis (Table S1 \u2020). The flat curves of the base sequence and mass distribution demonstrated higher accuracy (Fig. S1a \u2020).Using MEGAHIT software to assemble effective reads, the default length of KMER should be 21, 41, 61, 81, 99, and the length of contigs could exceed 600 in each group when the sum value reaches 90% of the total length of fragment (Table S2 \u2020). Using the ReefSeq database in NCBI, fecal microbial genes were indexed and the species annotated using Meta-Othello. The species annotation and abundance information for each sample were counted, and a species abundance information table obtained in Fig. 2. Among the classifiable sequences in different groups, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were represented the dominant lineages in the samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated. 24 Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\nPaperFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter.

The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis. 20,25 \nDe novo assembly and gene predictionsOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n20 However, the effects of JP on CRC mechanisms remain unclear. At present, next-generation sequencing platforms provide opportunities to explore taxonomic, protein-coding gene or protein expression diversities, by applying more comprehensive and less biased measurements to the diet, microbiota and the host. 24,50 The approach has provided new information on the diversity and composition of human gut microbiota. The influence of plant polysaccharides on bacterial growth and metabolism depends on polysaccharide structure, the dose assayed and the microorganism strain. 13 Recent findings have suggested a variety of potential mechanisms for plant polysaccharides acting on bacteria. For example, plant polysaccharides and/or oligosaccharide could bind to bacterial cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner, thus disturbing membrane function and inhibiting cell growth. 2,22,37 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial membrane. 23,36 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial\nPaperFood & Function membrane.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many conventional computational methods for identifying N6-methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m6A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m6A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m6A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m6A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, an online prediction web server implementing the four proposed predictors has been built and is available at http://server.malab.cn/Gene2vec/. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn a recent study, it was also shown that m 6 A is regulated by microRNA via complementary sequence motifs (Chen et al. 2015a), which suggested that sequence signaling is very important for m 6 A sites. Recently, a novel, singlebase-resolution technique, miCLIP-seq (Ke et al. 2015;Linder et al. 2015), was also established, which prompted a new wave of research on computational methods of m 6 A identification (Xiang et al. 2016;Zhou et al. 2016).Notably, m 6 A sites have methylation-specific surroundings, with the topology of a DRACH (where D = A, G, or U; R = A or G; and H = A, C, or U) consensus motif and a GAC consensus motif localized near stop codons, in 3 \u2032 -UTRs, within long internal exons, and at 5 \u2032 -UTRs (Meyer et al. 2012;Schwartz et al. 2013;Li et al. 2014;Luo et al. 2014;Zhou et al. 2016).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBased on information from MeRIP-seq experiments, comprehensive databases of m 6 A modification have been built to help researchers determine the locations and effects of these modifications (Liu et al. 2017a;Xuan et al. 2017). The work of Wan et al. (2015) showed that m 6 A patterns are similar between plants and mammals, with both being abundant near stop codons and 3 \u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) and having similar consensus m 6 A methylation motifs and similar frequencies of m 6 A sites per transcript in the transcriptome. Following the profiling of m 6 A distributions in mammalian transcriptomes (Dominissini et al. 2012;Meyer et al. 2012) and the mapping of the yeast m 6 A methylome (Schwartz et al. 2013), transcriptome-wide profiling of m 6 A in two accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (Luo et al. 2014) was performed, which indicated that m 6 A is a highly conserved mRNA modification in plants and that there is a positive correlation between m 6 A deposition and mRNA abundance.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2017), protein O-GlcNAcylation (Jia et al. 2018), histone crotonylation (Qiu et al. 2017), DNA N 4 -methylcytosine (Chen et al. 2017c;Wei et al. 2018b), RNA pseudouridine (Chen et al. 2016b), and various RNA adenosine modifications (Chen et al. 2018). However, it has been proven that sequence alignment (e.g., PSI-BLAST) cannot accurately identify the modification sites. Instead, machine learning techniques are used in approaches that are currently popular. For these, a sliding window is selected around the candidate modification sites. Then, sequences in the sliding window are collected for standard machine learning training and testing processes. Related features are then proposed for representing the sliding window sequences with equal length (Liu et al. 2015(Liu et al. , 2018;;He et al. 2018). However, in this context, there is a major problem regarding construction of the training data set.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Some species are of medicinal importance while some are well known weeds. In arid and semi-arid regions, E. cicutarium has had some importance as a forage plant and is an important grazing plant and source of protein supplements to straw for ruminants in semi deserts and wastelands of the Middle East. There is no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Due to the medicinal importance of this species, a genetic variability and populations\u2019 structure study is performed studying 15 geographical populations of E. cicutarium Therefore, we used six inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and 15 combined IRAP markers to reveal within and among population genetic diversity in this plant. AMOVA test produced significant genetic difference (PhiPT = 0.39, P = 0.010) among the studied populations and also revealed that, 55% of total genetic variability was due to within population diversity while, 45% was due to among population genetic differentiation. Mantel test showed positive significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance of the studied populations. Networking, STRUCTURE analyses and population assignment test revealed some degree of gene flow among these populations. PCoA plot of populations based on morphological characters was in agreement with MDS plot of molecular data.

Using the ReefSeq database in NCBI, fecal microbial genes were indexed and the species annotated using Meta-Othello. The species annotation and abundance information for each sample were counted, and a species abundance information table obtained in Fig. 2. Among the classifiable sequences in different groups, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were represented the dominant lineages in the samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated. 24 Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\nPaperFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis. 20,25 \nDe novo assembly and gene predictionsOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n20 However, the effects of JP on CRC mechanisms remain unclear. At present, next-generation sequencing platforms provide opportunities to explore taxonomic, protein-coding gene or protein expression diversities, by applying more comprehensive and less biased measurements to the diet, microbiota and the host. 24,50 The approach has provided new information on the diversity and composition of human gut microbiota. The influence of plant polysaccharides on bacterial growth and metabolism depends on polysaccharide structure, the dose assayed and the microorganism strain. 13 Recent findings have suggested a variety of potential mechanisms for plant polysaccharides acting on bacteria. For example, plant polysaccharides and/or oligosaccharide could bind to bacterial cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner, thus disturbing membrane function and inhibiting cell growth. 2,22,37 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial membrane. 23,36 Plant polysaccharides could also act on different bacterial species by generating hydrogen peroxide thereby altering the permeability of the microbial\nPaperFood & Function membrane.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The phase, photocatalytic hydrogen production, microstructure, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the fabricated photocatalysts were investigated. BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst has a larger ability for the hydrogen production in photocatalysis process than that of BiFeO3. The reason of the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst was revealed by the measurements of UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photocurrent curves and electrochemical impedance spectra. Moreover, the magnetic properties of BiFeO3 and BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalysts were also investigated to show the easy separation. These results in current work indicate that BiFeO3:Gd3+ is an excellent photocatalyst and has potential applications in photocatalytic hydrogen production. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nExcept for TiO 2 , various types of photocatalysts were reported in these years, such as titanate [7,8], AM 2 O 4 (A = Cu and Zn, M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co) [9,10], tantalite (niobate) [11,12], sulphide [13,14], ferrite [15,16] and some oxide semiconductor [17][18][19][20][21][22]. BiFeO 3 is a perovskite-type multiferroic compound, which shows potential applications in spintronics devices due to its high ferroelectric and magnetic phase transitions, as well as large remanent polarization at room temperature [23][24][25]. Moreover, it shows excellently photovoltaic effect and photocatalytic activity because that it can absorb a wide range of sunlight corresponding to its small E g [26][27][28]. For the applications in the photocatalyst field, one of advantages of BiFeO 3 is its excellently magnetic property. It is known that the separation of photocatalysts is essential after the photocatalytic process.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt is known that the separation of photocatalysts is essential after the photocatalytic process. Generally, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation are widely used in the separation process although they are complex and expensive [29,30]. But the separation process will be easy if the photocatalyst has the magnetism. It means that the photocatalyst can be separated easily by applying an exterior magnetic field.There are some reports for BiFeO 3 in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water [27,28,[31][32][33][34][35][36][37]]. Chen's work shows that the hydrothermally-synthesized BiFeO 3 nanocrystals have excellently photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation under visible light irradiation and the surface oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic activity effectively [37]. Other reports indicate that the photocatalytic activity of BiFeO 3 can be enhanced by doping ions, such as Sm and Mn [34,35], La and Se [36], and Gd [31][32][33].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAnalysis of electronic structure of 3d transition metal-doped TiO 2 based on band calculation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTUmebayashi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTYamaki\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHItoh\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKAsai\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

Nonetheless, its relatively long crystallization time and harsh synthesis conditions have strongly obstructed the enhancement of HP-MOFs space\u2013time yields (STYs) and the decrease in energy consumption. Herein, a simple and versatile method for preparing various HP-MOFs at room temperature was demonstrated, which had introduced surfactant as the template, whereas zinc oxide (ZnO) has been used as an accelerant. The resulting HP-MOFs showed multimodal hierarchical porous structures and excellent thermal stability. More importantly, the synthesis time was reduced dramatically to 11 min, with a maximal HP-MOFs STY of as high as 2575 kg m\u22123 d\u22121. Furthermore, the rapid formation process of HP-MOFs was examined through quantum chemistry calculation, and a feasible synthesis mechanism was also proposed. Notably, our synthesis strategy had shown a versatility, since other surfactants could also be used as the templates for the rapid room-temperature fabrication of diverse stable HP-MOFs. Importantly, the porosity of the HP-MOFs could be readily tuned through controlling the type of template. Moreover, gas adsorption measurement of HP-MOFs revealed high CH4 uptake capacity at 298 K due to the increase in surface area and pore volume. Our findings suggest that such method is applicable for the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of HP-MOFs on an industrial scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSequential functionalization of porous coordination polymer crystals\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKHirai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSFurukawa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMKondo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHUehara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOSakata\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSKitagawa\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/anie.201101924\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAngew Chem Int Edit\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t8057\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGeneralized hightemperature synthesis of zeolite catalysts with unpredictably high space-time yields (STYs)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCBian\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPan\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1039/C6TA09866E\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Mater Chem A\n\t\t\n\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t2613\n\t\t\t2017\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFacile conversion of hydroxy double salts to metal-organic frameworks using metal oxide particles and atomic layer deposition thinfilm templates\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJZhao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWTNunn\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPCLemaire\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1021/jacs.5b08752\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Am Chem Soc\n\t\t\n\t\t\t137\n\t\t\t13756\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA chemically functionalizable nanoporous material [Cu 3 (TMA) 2 (H2O) 3 ] n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSs-YChui\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSm-FLo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJPCharmant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAGOrpen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIDWilliams\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tScience\n\t\t\n\t\t\t283\n\t\t\t1148\n\t\t\t1999\n\nExcerpt 3: \nporous metal-organic frameworks by a versatile cooperative template strategy\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t27 August 2018\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t9EE36FFAB8CA5B1983826A6B5CEBCFB2\n\t\t\t\t\t10.1007/s10853-018-2793-3\n\t\t\t\t\tReceived: 6 June 2018 Accepted: 10 August 2018\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nHierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) are commonly prepared by means of hydrothermal synthesis.

In this paper, the parameter analysis method in signal processing and the meaning and characteristics of each parameter are introduced. Then, the waveform analysis method is introduced and the basic theory of wavelet transform and its spectrum analysis in waveform analysis method are mainly analyzed. The comparison between wavelet transform and Fourier transform is made: traditional Fourier transform signal processing methods can only be used to process transient stationary signals, and the transient non-stationary signals cannot be analyzed locally. The wavelet transform can take into account the characteristics of both the time and frequency domains, and it can also reflect the local signal well. Through the analysis of the signals in the process of concrete damage, it is found that the two signal processing methods mentioned above can well characterize the damage evolution of materials and damage precursors. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nEnhanced hydrogen production performance through controllable redox exsolution within CoFeAlO x spinel oxygen carrier materials\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDZeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYQiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJZeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRXiao\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

The concept of a smart city is introduced to improve the quality of city life. Smart cities are being developed to satisfy the need for the safety of its users\u2019 and secure journeys over in the urban scenario by proposing the smart mobility concept. At the same time, Vehicular adhoc network (VANET) comes under the type of mobile adhoc network (MANET), wherever the vehicles are treated as nodes in a network. The application of Big Data technologies to VANET gains useful insight from the massive quantity of operational data to enhance traffic management process like planning, engineering as well as operation. During the real-time processes, the VANET generates large data, and the VANET characteristics are mapped to Big Data attributes. Moreover, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed for routing in vehicular networks over Hadoop Map Reduce standalone distributed framework and over multi-node cluster with 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes.

The tool pin geometry directly affects the generation of heat and the flow of internal materials during the FSW process. The effects of the FSW tool pin angle on heat generation and internal flow have not been quantitatively investigated in detail. In this manuscript, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was implemented to analyze the effects of pin angle on the thermo-mechanical action during the FSW process of AA5058 Al-Mg alloy. Experimental test results validate the thermal outcomes of the used model. The obtained results revealed that, when the pin angle is increased, the heat generation decreases while the mechanical action of the tool increases. The internal heat distribution at a higher pin angle is symmetrical. The higher mechanical action of the tool decreases the viscosity of the internal materials and increases stirring action (materials flow) around the pin. Furthermore, plastic flow near the tool increased stirring action and formed a larger stir zone in the joint area.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this case, it is necessary to solve Navier-Stokes equations [32][33][34][35].

A 3D Cartesian system for the welded material (WM) and the FSW tools was established. All geometries and process parameters were selected according to the experimental tests. The origin was set at the middle point of the FSW tool shoulder. The x-axis indicated the welding direction, and the z-axis indicated the FSW tool normal axis. The FSW tool had rotational movement, and the interior domain was set to move according to the welding tool speed. The interior domain had the same velocity as the welding tool by the velocity inlet side. The sidewalls, along with the top and bottom, had the same velocity as the velocity of the inlet. The outer plate of the workpiece was set at zero pressure to avoid the reverse flow at the pressure outlet. The WM is assumed to be a non-Newtonian single-phase fluid representing the quasi-static thermal and fluid flow boundary problem.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

One of the main solutions for increasing the available capacity is the predetermined plan for constructing a water circulation system to restore the existing water resources. For this objective, a combination model was conducted based on a stormwater management technique and environment landscape system (ELS) under drought conditions. A hydrological framework was established using the long-term meteorological information in central China to estimate the extreme values of surface water in each stress period. A data analysis system was generated at three meteorological points of the study area and the developed model was incorporated to simulate the behavior of the subsurface flow. Consequently, a growth simulation model was designed according to the soil structure and vegetation canopy cover to formulate a real-time plan for the restoration of ELS. Results showed that the proposed model could improve the water productivity in urban and environment consumptions. Furthermore, technical analysis confirmed the suitability and applicability of the developed plan in cities with water shortages. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPoint of view research papers confirmed the need for a calibration process but the calibration methods were different (Kleidorfer et  \u0394V \u00bc P \u00fe S i \u00fe G i \u00c0 ETa \u00c0 I \u00c0 S 0 \u00c0 G 0 \u00b1 T (1)where \u0394V \u00bc storage capacity variation; P \u00bc precipitation; S i \u00bc surface water infiltration; G i \u00bc surface water infiltration;ETa \u00bc actual evapotranspiration; I \u00bc infiltration; S 0 \u00bc surface water seepage; G 0 \u00bc surface water seepage; T \u00bc tidal current.The surface flow rate will be obtained using the Manning equation.Q \u00bc 1 n AR 2=3 S 1=3 (2)where Infiltration rate (I r ) is one of the main component of the decision system that is formulated as follow:Q \u00bc discharge, n \u00bc Manning roughness coefficient A \u00bc cross-I r \u00bc I s (1 \u00fe C p (SM m \u00c0 SM)=SM m )(3)where I s \u00bc infiltration rate under the saturated condition;C p \u00bc the permeability coefficient; SM m \u00bc soil water capacity;\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2\u00c00.0487826.7\u00c00.0358895.10.00879905.10.01710865.80.01211913.7\u00c00.06712797.4\u00c00.05413885.60.0091\n\t\t\tDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/ws/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/ws.2021.027/837657/ws2021027.pdf by guest\n\t\t\tJ.

Al-MOF has been extensively characterized using FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, FE-SEM, TG-DTA, and Brunauer \u2013 Emmett \u2013 Teller (BET) techniques. The prepared samples, which included large hexagons and triangular channels, had a pore size of about 20 nm and a surface area of about 1245.2 m2/g, according to the results. The mechanism of the formation of Al-MOF has been proposed based on density functional theory with B3LYP and 6\u201331 G (d,p) as the basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbits (HOMO) to the lowest unusable molecular orbit (LUMO) are also used to discuss chemical reactivity patterns in molecules. Al-MOF has demonstrated anticancer activity against human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines, suggesting that it could be a promising anticancer drug for clinical use. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nJWieme\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKLejaeghere\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGKresse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVVan Speybroeck\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

Frontier orbital energy gap is the subtraction of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO). The Frontier orbital energy gap could be used to determine the interaction between different species. Harmonic vibrational waves were calculated using second-order analytical derivatives to confirm the convergence of minimums on the potential surface and to evaluate the zero-vibration contrast energy. As shown in Fig. 2 , in the finitecharge regime at one of the metal/molecule interfaces, the role of non-boundary modes is important, as these channels provide additional channels through which they can be used. An interface can be used to transmit the load [32] . As a result, the VESTA software used HOMO-LUMO to determine the most likely mechanism of Al-MOF formation [33] .

The desensitization phenomenon is well reproduced in numerical simulation using the JWL EOS and the Lee\u2013Tarver kinetic equation for modeling of the initiation of heterogeneous high explosives with as well as without shock front waves. The analysis of the wave processes occurring during the initiation of the acceptor HE charge has been carried out. Peculiarities of the wave processes in the water gap test assemblies, which can influence the results of sensitivity measurement, have been studied.

The desensitization phenomenon is well reproduced in numerical simulation using the JWL EOS and the Lee-Tarver kinetic equation for modeling of the initiation of heterogeneous high explosives with as well as without shock front waves. The analysis of the wave processes occurring during the initiation of the acceptor HE charge has been carried out. Peculiarities of the wave processes in the water gap test assemblies, which can influence the results of sensitivity measurement, have been studied. In particular, it has been established that precursor waves in the walls of the gap test assemblies can influence the detonation transmission distance.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIntroductionEvery industrial or storage facility where high explosive materials are handled requires special measures for preventing sympathetic detonation in case of an explosion to reduce damage due to a chain reaction. This is why understanding the sympathetic detonation phenomenon is extremely important for safety engineering. The gap test is one of the easiest and widely used methods for measuring shock sensitivity of high explosives.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe experimental assembly is shown in Fig. 1.Distances for reliable detonation transmission, as well as failure distances for acceptor HE charge initiation through water have been measured without any inert insert and for inserts made of PTFE, copper, and silicon carbide of varying heights. In total, the authors have conducted 27 experiments. Experimental detonation transmission and detonation failure distances are presented in Table 1.Thus, it has been demonstrated that explosive loading of an acceptor HE charge by a precursor wave through a copper or ceramic insert leads to its significant desensitization. With all other conditions being equal, the distance for copper has 123 been found to be 75 % and for silicon carbide only 60 % of the value for a PTFE insert.It should be noted that for a silicon carbide insert the precursor wave is, in fact, a compression wave without a shock front, because it has been propagating in an elastic material [7].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Although, professional stock analysts and fund managers usually make subjective judgments, based on objective technical indicators, it is difficult for non-professionals to apply this forecasting technique because there are too many complex technical indicators to be considered. Moreover, two drawbacks have been found in many of the past forecasting models: (1) statistical assumptions about variables are required for time series models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), to produce forecasting models of mathematical equations, and these are not easily understood by stock investors; and (2) the rules mined from some artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as neural networks (NN), are not easily realized.\n\nIn order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model, using multi-technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Further, it includes four proposed procedures in the hybrid model to provide efficient rules for forecasting, which are evolved from the extracted rules with high support value, by using the toolset based on rough sets theory (RST): (1) select the essential technical indicators, which are highly related to the future stock price, from the popular indicators based on a correlation matrix; (2) use the cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA) and minimize the entropy principle approach (MEPA) to partition technical indicator value and daily price fluctuation into linguistic values, based on the characteristics of the data distribution; (3) employ a RST algorithm to extract linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset; and (4) utilize genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to get better forecasting accuracy and stock return. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with two types of performance evaluations, accuracy and stock return, and by using a six-year period of the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) as the experiment dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, RST and GAs). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFrom the model verification, it is shown that the refined processes are effective in improving forecasting accuracy, and, based on the evidence, a stock analyst or investor can employ the refined processes proposed in this paper to improve their forecasting tools or models.The rest of this paper is organized, as follows: Section 2 introduces the related works; Section 3 demonstrates the proposed model and algorithm; Section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed model and describes the findings; and Section 5 draws conclusions and proposes recommendations for future research.\nRelated worksThis section reviews related works of technical analysis, cumulative probability distribution approach, minimize entropy principle approach, rough set theory, and genetic algorithms.\nTechnical analysisTechnical analysis is an attempt to predict future stock price movements by analyzing a past sequence of stock prices [39]. It relies on charts and looks for particular configurations that are supposed to have predictive value. Analysts focus on investor psychology, which represents common investors' responses to certain price formations and price movements, to analyze the fluctuations of stock market. The price at which investors are willing to buy or sell depends on personal expectation. If investors expect the security price to rise, they will buy it; if investors expect the security price to fall, they will sell it.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA hybrid financial trading system incorporating chaos theory, statistical and artificial intelligence/soft computing methods\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNClarence\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWTan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tQueensland Finance Conference\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1999\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSchool of Information Technology, Bond University\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBusiness failure prediction using rough sets\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAIDimitras\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSlowinski\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSusmaga\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCZopounidis\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEuropean Journal of Operational Research\n\t\t\n\t\t\t114\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1999\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAutoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity with estimator of the variance of United Kingdom inflation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRFEngle\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEconometrica\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1982\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBiases in the crossover landscape\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLJEshelman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRACaruana\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJDSchaffer\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the 11th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\tthe 11th International Joint Conference on Artificial IntelligenceSan Mateo\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMorgan Kaufmann\n\t\t\t1989\n\nExcerpt 3: \nJHHolland\n\t\t\n\t\tAdaptation in Nature and Artificial Systems\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUniversity of Michigan Press\n\t\t\t1975\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe application of neural networks to forecast fuzzy time series\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKHuarng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHKYu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPhysica A\n\t\t\n\t\t\t363\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do we know about the profitability of technical analysis?\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSHIrwin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCHPark\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Economic Surveys\n\t\t\n\t\t\t21\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGenetic algorithms approach to feature discretization in artificial neural networks for prediction of stock index\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKKim\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIHan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tExpert System with Application\n\t\t\n\t\t\t19\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAn evolutionary approach to the combination of multiple classifiers to predict a stock price index\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJKim\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSHMin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIHan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tExpert Systems with Applications\n\t\t\n\t\t\t31\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2006\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Compared with the conventional neural network learning algorithm it overcomes the slow training speed and over-fitting problems. ELM is based on empirical risk minimization theory and its learning process needs only a single iteration. The algorithm avoids multiple iterations and local minimization. It has been used in various fields and applications because of better generalization ability, robustness, and controllability and fast learning rate. In this paper, we make a review of ELM latest research progress about the algorithms, theory and applications. It first analyzes the theory and the algorithm ideas of ELM, then tracking describes the latest progress of ELM in recent years, including the model and specific applications of ELM, finally points out the research and development prospects of ELM in the future.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n01180.003178.6877.5720BP3.01160.003586.6374.7320SVM0.18600.067378.7677.31317.16Forest-typeELM1.61480.719592.3590.21200BP12 minN/A82.4481.85100SVM693.6000347.7833 91.7089.9031,806very good development.

In particular, EM-ELMs can easily be extended to test some number of random candidates at each step and select the best of them, as SAOCIF does. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the cost of the computation of the optimal output-layer weights in the originally proposed EM-ELMs can be improved if it is replaced by the one included in SAOCIF.In addition, there are still a lot of applications about ELM in other areas. An improved ELM method was proposed for soft sensing modeling by Chang et al. (2007). By adding a kind of sorting neurons into the hidden layer of the single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), a new SLFN structure was proposed. The method provided a new approach to build soft sensing models, and it was successfully applied to the soft sensing modeling the of cell concentration for the Nosiheptied fermentation process to realize the online prediction of the cell concentration.

It is a process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups, where each group contains objects which are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and different from those of other groups. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data which have anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, bioinformatics, biology, recommendation systems and the clustering of text documents. Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of their convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based globalized search algorithm that uses the principles of the social behavior of swarms. PSO produces better results in complicated and multi-peak problems. This paper presents a literature survey on the PSO algorithm and its variants to clustering high-dimensional data. An attempt is made to provide a guide for the researchers who are working in the area of PSO and high-dimensional data clustering. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTo help professionals to quickly and accurately diagnose any latent heart disease, the proposed systematic approach produced results that were consistent with the manual labels with 99.5% average accuracy. Marini and Walczak (2011) proposed a discrete binary-coded implementation of the PSO algorithm to identify and select variables with a significant clustering tendency. In particular, to cope with the problems that can arise when performing variable selection on data sets with a high number of variables, and to account for the possibility of using the method also for purely exploratory purposes, an unsupervised approach was used, where the fitness was computed based on hierarchical clustering models. The characteristics of the method were shown on two simulated data sets and on a real megavariate data set coming from the analysis of genomic microarrays. They conclude that in all cases, PSO allowed them to explore different subspaces and to discover meaningful structures in the analyzed data. Based on these considerations, it is apparent that the use of PSO can represent a very promising option to deal with the problem of finding groups in a multivariate data set in a relatively straightforward and reliable way.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn experiments, SVM classification accuracy using PSO-selected bands was much higher than using all the original bands or dimensionalityreduced data. Zhang and Mahfouf (2011) introduced a framework for data-driven fuzzy modeling, named HFM-DSMO. As a multi-objective optimization algorithm, it used MPSO (Zhang and Mahfouf 2006), a modification of the PSO algorithm. This proposed modeling approach was successfully applied within the context of high-dimensional industrial data, the manufacturing of heat-treated alloy steels. Chuang et al. (2011) stated that the PSO, applied to clusters in multi-dimensional space, has shown outstanding performance. However, the rate of convergence when searching for global optima is still not sufficient (Kao et al. 2008). For this reason, they combined chaotic map particle swarm optimization (CPSO) with an accelerated convergence rate strategy (Chuanwen and Bompard 2005;Xiang et al. 2007). This technique allows the ACPSO algorithm to cluster arbitrary data better than previous algorithms.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2003;Parsons et al. 2004). Variable selection in clustering has been approached from different perspectives: density-based methods such as (Agrawal et al. 1998;Chan and Hall 2010;Raftery and Dean 2006), model-based methods such as (Pan and Shen 2007;Wang ans Zhu 2008), and criterion-based methods such as (Witten and Tibshirani 2010;Raftery and Dean 2006).Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of the convergence and the sensitivity to initialization values, etc. and they still require much investigation to improve performance and efficiency. Clustering methods such as the K-means algorithm, soft clustering based on mixed models, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering have been developed and have proven to be successful in many real world applications (Kriegel et al. 2009;Luxburg 2007;Steinbach et al. 2003;Parsons et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A number of conclusions can be drawn from Table 2 such as:\u2022 Most of the formulations for CF propose a mathematical programming model with the main objective of minimising the total number of intercellular movements. Other mathematical programming formulations involve cost related objective functions and only a few consider machine/load utilisation as a goal parameter for CF;\u2022 Mathematical programming formulations for CF are hard to implement due to computational limitations for large scale problems.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nChenDefersha\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSusanto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1999\n\t\t\t36\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHaqVenkumar\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMak\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\t37\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTorkul\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2006\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRaoRavichandran\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2001\n\t\t\t38\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLozano\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2001\n\t\t\t39\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJames\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\t14\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMukattash\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2002\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTavakkoli-Moghaddam\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\t15\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGuerrero\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2002\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSaidi-Mehrabad\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSafaei\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\t16\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOverall, the proposed algorithm performed well on all test problems by either exceeding or matching the solution quality of the results presented in the literature.\nComparison of CF methodsAs can be seen from the previous section a significant but not exhaustive list of research papers has been included emphasizing work on CF carried over the last decade. It is worth noting that these papers were selected to be included in this review as their contribution towards CF covers a large spectrum of research directions over the last ten years. All papers have been classified based on different methodologies employed such as mathematical programming, heuristics/metaheuristics and artificial intelligence approaches and their contribution discussed.For the purpose of this section a comparison and evaluation of the CF formulations is carried out. Table 1 presents a numbered list of CF reference sources and Table 2 a comparison of these numbered sources based on major criteria. The latter involves major objectives and constraints included, solution approaches employed, maximum size of problem data solved, identification of whether the optimum value or deviation from the optimum solution is provided when largest problem solved and whether methodology has been compared to other existing methodologies and finally implementation tools adopted.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this problem, the most popular performance measure is the top precision measure, and the most important component of a retrieval system is the similarity function used to compare a query image against a database image. However, up to now, there is no existing similarity learning method proposed to optimize the top precision measure. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel similarity learning method to maximize the top precision measure. We model this problem as a minimization problem with an objective function as the combination of the losses of the relevant images ranked behind the top-ranked irrelevant image, and the squared Frobenius norm of the similarity function parameter. This minimization problem is solved as a quadratic programming problem. The experiments over two benchmark data sets show the advantages of the proposed method over other similarity learning methods when the top precision is used as the performance measure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA synthesis of feedback and feedforward control for process improvement under stationary and nonstationary time series disturbance models\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLShi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKCKapur\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tQuality and Reliability Engineering International\n\t\t\n\t\t\t31\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMargin-based over-sampling method for learning from imbalanced datasets\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXFan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKTang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWeise\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the 15th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-2011)\n\t\tthe 15th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-2011)Berlin Heidelberg\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpringer\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPortfolio choices with orthogonal bandit learning\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWShen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tY.-GJiang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHZha\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\tthe 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe experiments over some benchmark databases show its advantages over other similarity learning methods.

The Euclidean distance between the classification response vectors are used as the new similarity measure.

To prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve its color change sensitivity, it was immobilized with polyvinyl alcohol and a high-absorbance material. The color of the pH indicator changes from yellow to blue and finally purple to indicate spoilage, which can be easily detected by the naked eye. The asprepared pH indicator exhibited good response to pH changes on the surface of chicken breast meat, and no migration of the dye from the indicator onto the surface of the chicken was observed. This pH indicator exhibits excellent feasibility for real-time, direct-contact monitoring of the freshness and quality of various foods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n42; Whatman plc, Maidstone, UK) as the indicator carrier were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MI, USA), OCI Co., Ltd. (Incheon, Korea), and GE Healthcare UK Ltd. (Little Chalfont, UK), respectively. Deionized water was used as the solvent for PVA. A 15 \u03bcm polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was supplied by Soojoung Co., Ltd. (Gwangju, Korea). A highabsorbance pad with a three-layered structure of gauze/supersorbent polymer (polyacrylamide)/gauze was purchased from Yuhan Kimberly Co., Ltd. (Daejeon, Korea).Fabrication of pH indicator First, BCP was immobilized on a filter paper using the absorption method (9) by simply immersing the filter paper in 20 mL BCP/PVA/deionized water solution (0.03 g/10 g/90 mL) for 1 h at ambient temperature.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis methodology works by detecting gradual changes in pH caused by the spoilage of fish, as volatile basic amines evolved into the food package headspace cause an increase in the pH and subsequently the color of the indicator changes from yellow to blue, which is easily detected by the naked eye. Studies using the same principle have been reported by Kuswandi et al. (2).However, to the best of our knowledge, research on real-time monitoring of product freshness has mainly focused on the color changes of indicators in packaging headspace (2-4,14-16). Onpackage sensors containing pH-sensitive dyes only respond to volatile spoilage compounds in the headspace evolved from the surface of foods. In other words, these non-direct-contact methods require some headspace and respond only to volatile spoilage compounds. Therefore, these technologies are limited as they do not respond to compounds dissolved on the surface of products. However, for safety reasons, the problem of dye migration into food products must be taken into account for direct-contact-type indicators.The purpose of this study was to develop a real-time pH-indicating monitor based on bromocresol purple (BCP) suitable for direct contact with chicken breast surfaces.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThen, the BCP/PVA/filter paper was dried in an oven at 70 o C for 24 h. The filter paper impregnated with BCP and PVA was then cut to the desired shape and size and placed on the PET film. It was covered with the pad, and the PET film and pad was tightly sealed at the edge with adhesive tape. As shown in Fig. 1, the dimensions of the obtained indicators were approximately 10 mmx10 mm and yellow in color.Physicochemical and microbiological changes Fresh and boneless chicken breast of normal pH (5.9-6.0) was purchased from a local poultry meat shop (Wonju, Korea). The chicken breast was cut into 100 g portions, placed on plastic trays, and wrapped in low density polyethylene film that had been sterilized in the clean bench under UV-B conditions for 1 h, as shown in Fig. 1. To investigate the color change in the pH indicator due to quality changes during storage, the as-prepared indicator was placed directly on the surface of the chicken breast.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[26][27][28]  The unique shape and easily controlled dimensions (from tens to hundreds of nanometers) of molecular bottlebrushes render them particularly useful as molecular building blocks for generating nanostructured materials by ( 1) single-molecule manipulation to create well-defined nano-objects, (2) solution self-assembly to produce larger aggregates with different morphologies, and (3) melt self-assembly to fabricate periodic nanomaterials with large domain spacings. In each of these applications, the peculiar properties of bottlebrush copolymers enable the synthesis of previously inaccessible materials in a controlled and predictable fashion.The molecular templating method based on bottlebrush copolymers combines excellent dimensional control of solid templating methods and scalability of self-assembly approaches to provide a robust platform for the construction of 1D nanoobjects with tunable dimensions (Figure 2). A molecular bottlebrush can be viewed as a covalently preassembled cylindrical polymer micelle.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We recognize that MendNano is a dynamic model though many aspects in the publication appear to rely primarily on steady state assumptions. As the authors of MendNano, we are sure that Cohen et al. are more familiar with their model than anyone else. Generalizations on our part may be due to limited space. Second, our statement regarding MendNano's capabilities was not that the model cannot be used to look at different land uses or water types, but rather that from the published works, we were under the impression that only one type can be considered at a time.We did not consider nor state that dissolution is independent of particle size. Rather that, as a screening tool, we chose to limit the complexity required by introducing particle size distribution not unlike other existing models and most MFA models. [2][3][4] This necessitated simplifying the calculations so that the amount of data necessary to run the model was manageable. In addition, we felt that modeling dissolution patterns at the individual particle scale when trying to represent a much larger region would not be efficient.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, until recently, few studies have examined associations between physical activity and health in young children. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between physical activity and selected health outcomes in children younger than 6 yr.\nMethods: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies examining the associations between physical activity and adiposity/weight status, bone health, cardiometabolic health, and cognition in children younger than 6 yr.\nResults: Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and served as the basis for this systematic review. For weight status/adiposity, 12 of 15 studies found negative associations between physical activity and one or more measures of the outcome. For bone health, 10 articles based on four studies were identified, and nine studies showed stronger bone in more active children. For cardiometabolic health, three studies were identified and findings were limited and inconsistent. For cognition, two systematic reviews were identified and findings were limited. For all four health outcomes, evidence of dose-response relationships and effect modification by demographic factors was very limited.\nConclusions: There is strong evidence indicating that higher amounts of physical activity are associated with better indicators of bone health and with reduced risk for excessive increases in weight and adiposity in children 3 to 6 yr. Evidence was too limited to support conclusions regarding the effects of physical activity on cardiometabolic health and cognition. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAssociation among serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and physical activity, physical fitness, and body composition in young children\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRHDurant\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTBaranowski\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTRhodes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBGutin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWOThompson\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRCarroll\n\t\t\n\t\t8345412\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Pediatr\n\t\t\n\t\t\t123\n\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1993\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical activity and respiratory symptoms in children: the Generation R Study\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLMDriessen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKiefte-DeJong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJCJaddoe\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVWHofman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tARaat\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHDe Jongste\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJC\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/ppul.22839\n\t\t23843308\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPediatr Pulmonol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t49\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAll studies used state-of-the-art imaging (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)) to measure bone outcomes and appropriate statistical modeling to control for growth. All studies examining children ages 3-5 years showed statistically significant stronger bone in the more active children. The benefit differences were greater than expected via measurement error and large enough (almost always >3%) to indicate meaningful biological improvements. However, similar to the evidence for body weight and adiposity, the differences in physical activity measures prevented the assignment of a specific dose of physical activity needed for bone health benefits.\nCardiometabolic health.Very few studies have examined the association between physical activity and indicators of cardiometabolic health in children younger than age 6 years. The literature search resulted in the identification of three prospective cohort studies that included outcomes related to serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, respiratory symptoms, and blood pressure (37)(38)(39).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhile these studies were consistent in observing benefit with higher amounts of physical activity, limitations in study design and variability in methodologies across the studies precluded identifying a particular dose of physical activity that was needed to provide benefits.\nBone health.The literature search provided eight papers, with two additional papers added by committee members. These 10 papers represented four studies, two of which had prospective longitudinal study designs and two of which were randomized controlled trials (27)(28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36). The study designs, methods, and findings of these studies are summarized in Table 2. Three of the four studies focused on preschool children (baseline ages 3 to 5) (27)(28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33)(34)(35) and one study focused on infants (36). The dose of physical activity was defined and measured differently among the studies and included recreational gymnastics participation (months) (28)(29)(30), device-measured daily activity (min) (31)(32)(33)(34), and bone-strengthening physical activity (sessions) (27,35,36).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Until now, a large number of research papers and books have been written on Ostrowski inequalities and their numerous applications.On the other hand, many studies have recently been carried out in the field of q-analysis, starting with Euler due to a high demand for mathematics that models quantum computing q-calculus appeared as a connection between mathematics and physics. It has several applications in different mathematical areas such as number theory, combinatorics, orthogonal polynomials, basic hypergeometric functions, and other sciences, quantum theory, mechanics, and the theory of relativity [13][14][15][16]. Apparently, Euler was the founder of this branch of mathematics, by using the parameter q in Newton's work on infinite series. Later, Jackson was the first to develop q-calculus that knows without limit calculus in a systematic way [13].In 1908-1909, Jackson defined the general q-integral and q-difference operator [15].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAn inequality of Ostrowski-type for mappings whose second derivatives are bounded and applications\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPCerone\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSSDragomir\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJRoumeliotis\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEast Asian Math.

One way to achieve a sustainable future in urban areas and remote communities is to use the independent renewable energy systems. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common sources of energy generation that has attracted of the world. The present study provides the comprehensive examine the performance of two parabolic dish collector and flat-plate collector from energy, exergy, Enviroeconomic and Exergoenviroeconomic view of points. To examine the performance of solar systems, the climatic conditions of two different cities in Asia (Beijing and Tehran) have been used. In addition, the performance of the systems is investigated under different parameters and using different working fluids and MWCNT nanoparticle. It was found that the both solar systems have better overall performance in Tehran than in Beijing. Moreover, in the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months. In addition, the lowest and highest Levelized Cost of Energy are belong to dish collector (in Tehran with water) and flat plate collector (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively. For Tehran, LCOE of dish collector increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMWCNT has extraordinary thermal properties and can be widely used industrially and commercially as a new generation of refrigerants and thermal operating fluids. The use of these nanofluids in thermal systems can increase the efficiency and significantly increase the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient in equal Reynolds. This group of nanofluids in different base fluids such as ethylene glycol and water with suitable stability can be provided. The physical properties of the nanofluid should be determined based on the nanoparticle and base fluid physical properties. These properties include viscosity, density, thermal conductivity and specific heat Ehyaei et al. (2019). The physical properties of nanofluids can be obtained using the following equations (Khanjari et al. 2016;Loni et al. 2017;Zadeh et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn addition, the impact of the use of nanofluids on the performance of systems is investigated. Dowtherm Q is a synthetic organic HTF containing a mixture of alkylated aromatics and diphenylethane. Compared to hot oils, it represents better thermal consistency and significantly better low-temperature pump ability.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDifferent heat transfer fluidsIn this subsection, the FPC and PDC performances with various HTFs is investigated. These heat transfer fluids include water, Dowtherm Q, and water/MWCNT and Dowtherm Q/MWCNT nanofluids. Fig. 11 shows the SEM image and XRD graph of MWCNT particles. The diameter of MWCNT is between 20 nm and 50 nm. It has been shown that the performance of a solar collector can be significantly improved by adding amounts of nanoparticles to the working fluid. The benefit of nanofluids as a working fluid raises the thermal conductivity, which leads to more thermal energy production. In other words, by increasing the thermal conductivity, more thermal energy is produced at higher temperatures. That is, the difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the solar collector increases. Fig. 12 shows the thermal conductivity of different HTFs versus particle volume fraction. Obviously, by adding nanoparticle to the working fluids, the value of k of the heat transfer fluid increases. For instance, at \u03c6 = 5%, the value of k of water/MWCNT nanofluid is 21.36% higher than that of water.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Both positive social interactions and stress are known to induce OXT secretion, but the relative influence of either of these triggers is not well delineated. Choir singing is an activity known to improve mood and to induce feelings of social closeness, and may therefore be used to investigate the effects of positive social experiences on OXT system activity. We quantified mood and salivary OXT and cortisol (CORT) concentrations before, during, and after both choir and solo singing performed in a randomized order in the same participants (repeated measures). Happiness was increased, and worry and sadness as well as salivary CORT concentrations were reduced, after both choir and solo singing. Surprisingly, salivary OXT concentrations were significantly reduced after choir singing, but did not change in response to solo singing. Salivary OXT concentrations showed high intra-individual stability, whereas salivary CORT concentrations fluctuated between days within participants. The present data indicate that the social experience of choir singing does not induce peripheral OXT secretion, as indicated by unchanged salivary OXT levels. Rather, the reduction of stress/arousal experienced during choir singing may lead to an inhibition of peripheral OXT secretion. These data are important for the interpretation of future reports on salivary OXT concentrations, and emphasize the need to strictly control for stress/arousal when designing similar experiments. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOf course, it may be that positive bilateral interactions or the powerful intimate bond between parents and their children, romantic partners, or dogs and their owners are needed to trigger the OXT system to a quantifiable extent-aspects that are missing from choir singing.It is possible that increases or decreases in stress/arousal, rather than social experience, drives salivary OXT concentrations. In other words, singing may cause an increase (or a decrease) in stress signals from the brain stem and/or amygdala to the hypothalamus, resulting in the activation (or quiescence) of the HPA axis and the OXT system. If this is true, it can be expected that CORT responses resemble OXT responses to singing. This was indeed the case in previous studies: Kreutz (2014) reported an increase in both OXT and CORT concentrations after choir singing (but note that the reported CORT values were supraphysiologically high), whereas Fancourt et al. (2016) reported a decrease in both OXT and CORT concentrations.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis hypothesis was based on two lines of reasoning: (i) an earlier study reporting an increase in salivary OXT concentrations (139% of basal) after 30 min of choir rehearsal, including 10 min of warm-up exercises and repeatedly singing the pop-song ''California Dreaming'' (Kreutz, 2014); and (ii) reports of other positive social experiences resulting in OXT secretion, such as intense parent-child interactions, massage, gossiping with friends, and loving interactions between participants and their dogs (Grewen et al., 2005;Gonzaga et al., 2006;Feldman et al., 2010;Beetz et al., 2013;Kim et al., 2014;Tsuji et al., 2015;Krause et al., 2016;Lebowitz et al., 2016;Brondino et al., 2017).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhereas salivary OXT levels mildly increased after solo singing (116% of basal), they were significantly reduced after choir singing (81% of basal), independent of sex. The results for the solo condition are in line with a previous finding (Grape et al., 2002), which showed a mild, but significant 125% increase in plasma OXT concentrations in both amateur and professional singers (but note that a currently criticized quantification method was used; see McCullough et al., 2013). In addition, our results for choir singing are in agreement with a recent study reporting a reduction in salivary OXT levels (75% of basal) after 70 min of choir rehearsal, including learning new, unidentified songs (Fancourt et al., 2016). Combined, our results do not support the hypothesis that the social experience of choir singing promotes the secretion of OXT from the neurohypophysis into circulation and eventually in saliva.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this study, we investigated the role of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel-mediated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in purinergic-mediated disassembly of adherens and tight junction complexes in early tubular injury.\nMethods: Human primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTECs) and clonal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were treated with Transforming Growth Factor Beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) \u00b1 apyrase, or ATP\u03b3S for 48 h. For inhibitor studies, cells were co-incubated with Cx43 mimetic Peptide 5, or purinergic receptor antagonists Suramin, A438079 or A804598. Immunoblotting, single-cell force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assessed protein expression, cell-cell adhesion and paracellular permeability. Carboxyfluorescein uptake and biosensing measured hemichannel activity and real-time ATP release, whilst a heterozygous Cx43+/- mouse model with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) assessed the role of Cx43 in vivo.\nResults: Immunohistochemistry of biopsy material from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed increased expression of purinergic receptor P2X7. TGF-\u03b21 increased Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity and ATP release in hPTECs and HK2 cells. The cytokine reduced maximum unbinding forces and reduced cell-cell adhesion, which translated to increased paracellular permeability. Changes were reversed when cells were co-incubated with either Peptide 5 or P2-purinoceptor inhibitors. Cx43+/- mice did not exhibit protein changes associated with early tubular injury in a UUO model of fibrosis.\nConclusion: Data suggest that Cx43 mediated ATP release represents an initial trigger in early tubular injury via its actions on the adherens and tight junction complex. Since Cx43 is highly expressed in nephropathy, it represents a novel target for intervention of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CKD. Video Abstract In proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), tight junction proteins, including zona occuludens-1 (ZO-1), contribute to epithelial integrity, whilst the adherens junction protein epithelial (E)-cadherin (ECAD) maintains cell-cell coupling, facilitating connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and the direct transfer of small molecules and ions between cells. In disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) binds to its receptor and recruits SMAD2/3 signalling ahead of changes in gene transcription and up-regulation of Cx43-mediated hemichannels (HC). Uncoupled hemichannels permit the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in to the extracellular space (\u2191[ATP]e), where ATP binds to the P2X7 purinoreceptor and activates the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inflammation results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibrosis and tubular injury. A major consequence is further loss of ECAD and reduced stickiness between cells, which can be functionally measured as a decrease in the maximum unbinding force needed to uncouple two adherent cells (Fmax). Loss of ECAD feeds forward to further lessen cell-cell coupling exacerbating the switch from GJIC to HC-mediated release of ATP. Reduction in ZO-1 impedes tight junction effectiveness and decreases trans-epithelial resistance (\u2193TER), resulting in increased paracellular permeability. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCo-incubation of both HK2 and hPTECS with TGF-\u03b21 and Peptide 5 significantly reduced dye uptake and restored ATP release to near basal, whilst Peptide 5 successfully prevented TGF-\u03b21-evoked changes in expression of E-cadherin, Ncadherin, Claudin-2 and ZO-1 in human primary renal proximal tubule cells.Confirmation for Cx43 mediated ATP release in initiating these changes of early tubular injury, was confirmed in a Cx43 +/-heterogeneous knockout mouse model having undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The UUO model recapitulates the fundamental pathogenic mechanisms that typify all forms of CKD including diabetic nephropathy and is widely used for the study of renal fibrosis and inflammation [36]. Staining renal cortex slices from wildtype UUO mice confirmed a decrease in N-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, whilst immunoblotting of isolated renal cortex protein demonstrated reduced E-cadherin expression, with increased expression of \u03b2-catenin.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHuman renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were incubated with TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/mL) \u00b1 Peptide 5 (25 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Co-incubation of hPTECs with TGF-\u03b21 and Peptide 5 restored ECAD expression (Fig. 7a) from 31.5 \u00b1 9.2% to 108.9 \u00b1 17.1%; NCAD expression (Fig. 7b) from 280.5 \u00b1 16.7% to 154.7 \u00b1 10.6%; Claudin-2 expression (Fig. 7c) 65.3 \u00b1 5.4% to 100.9 \u00b1 10% and finally ZO-1 expression (Fig. 7c) from 59.63 \u00b1 3.1% to 91.6 \u00b1 12.8% as compared to low-glucose control.

This family of membrane proteins is the molecular constituent of gap junction channels and hemichannels that provide pathways for direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm and inside-out exchange, respectively. Both types of Cx channels are permeable to ions and small signaling molecules allowing astrocytes to establish dynamic interactions with neurons. So far, most pharmacological approaches currently available do not distinguish between these two channel functions, stressing the need to develop new specific molecular tools. In astrocytes two major Cxs are expressed, Cx43 and Cx30, and there is now evidence indicating that at least Cx43 operates as a gap junction channel as well as a hemichannel in these cells. Based on studies in primary cultures as well as in acute hippocampal slices, we report here that Gap19, a nonapeptide derived from the cytoplasmic loop of Cx43, inhibits astroglial Cx43 hemichannels in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting gap junction channels. This peptide, which not only selectively inhibits hemichannels but is also specific for Cx43, can be delivered in vivo in mice as TAT-Gap19, and displays penetration into the brain parenchyma.

Surgical repair remains the operation of choice; however, the outcome often is poor. We investigated the ability of injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a preclinical model.\nMethods: Twenty-four inbred Wistar Furth rats were divided into three groups. As a control, Group A underwent sham operation. Group B had sphincterotomy and repair of both anal sphincters plus saline injections. The study group (Group C) underwent sphincterotomy and repair followed by intrasphincteric injections of syngenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. A further group (Group D) of outbred Wistar rats treated with mesenchymal stem cells and immunosuppressive therapy also was evaluated. At 30 days, histologic and morphometric analysis and in vitro contractility testing was performed.\nResults: A significant decrease of muscle tissue was observed at the site of repair after sphincter injury. However, in Groups C and D, histologic examination demonstrated new muscle fibers and morphometric analysis revealed a significantly greater muscle area fraction than in Group B (P < 0.05). Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells injection improved contractility of sphincters strips compared with Group B (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between Groups C and D.\nConclusions: In our experimental model, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells injection improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after injury and repair. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells may represent an attractive tool for treating anal sphincter lesions in humans. Investigations into the biologic basis of this phenomenon should increase our knowledge on underlying mechanisms involved in sphincter repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nStem cells could be injected at the moment of surgical repair or percutaneously by ultrasonographic guide in selected injured areas and improve the regeneration and the healing of damaged anal sphincters. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm and expand our preliminary results before attempting this in the clinical setting.FIGURE 1 .1FIGURE 1. Histologic examination after four weeks. The external anal sphincter (EAS) appeared more compact than the internal anal sphincter (IAS) (Group A, a). In Group B, a gap filled with fibrous connective tissue and dilated blood vessels was observed within each muscle layer at the site of sphincter repair (SR) (b). Injected MSC led to increased sphincter mass at the site of SR in Group C (c) and Group D (d). m = mucosa; arrows = residual suture material (original magnification; 4x) (Group A: sham; Group B: SR + saline; Group C: SR + MSC; Group D: SR + MSC + CsA). SR = sphincter repair; MSC = bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; CsA = cyclosporine.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, each sphincter was divided and repaired one by one, and, at histologic examination, we found that MSC improved smooth or striated muscular regeneration if injected into the IAS or the EAS, respectively. Nevertheless, a mixed repair of the sphincter complex may occur after a crushed injury, and the contribution of stem cells to such a repair needs to be further investigated.Another interesting finding is that there were no significant differences between results of the two groups treated with MSC. Autologous cells undoubtedly present major advantages; however, allogenic cells may be useful when a rapid employement is required, even if a period of immunosuppressive therapy has to be administered. 41 In our experiment, immunosuppression with CsA had no negative effects on the outcome of sphincter repair associated with MSC injection. Furthermore, it has been shown that various stem cell types, including muscle-derived cells, can differentiate into muscle lineage. 42,43 Thus, additional studies will be necessary in the future to examine and compare different stem cells proposed to anal sphincter repair after injury.\nCONCLUSIONSThis study provides an experimental basis for potential future clinical application of stem cells therapy for anal sphincter injuries.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[17][18][19][20] Thus, MSC injection may represent a new attractive treatment option for anal sphincter lesions. Moreover, experimental injury of detrusor muscle and urethral sphincter has been successfully treated with stem cells injection as a potential therapy for urinary incontinence. [21][22][23][24][25][26] To our knowledge, no previous report on the use of stem cells for the treatment of anal incontinence is present in the surgical literature.We developed an experimental rat model of anal sphincters injury treated with primary surgical repair and investigated the contribution of injected MSC on the regeneration and the healing of damaged sphincters using histologic and functional studies.\nMATERIALS AND METHODSThis study was approved by the local ethics committee and all procedures were conducted in accordance with the European legislation and with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals established by the National Institutes of Health.Twenty-four male inbred Wistar Furth rats (weight range, 250-300 g) from Charles River Laboratories (Lecco, Italy) were used and divided into three groups of eight animals each.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A statistically significantly higher number of these cells was found within the epidermis in necrobiosis lipoidica compared with granuloma annulare and normal skin. The numbers were similar to those seen in sarcoidosis and tuberculous reactions in the skin, which raises the possibility of an immune pathogenesis for necrobiosis lipoidica. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n'*^''' Vascular changes are few.\"* A cell-mediated immune reaction has been implicated with the demonstration of increased numbers of T helper/inducer lymphocytes within the granulomatous infiltrate, an increased number of 0KT6 positive Langerhans cells within epidermis and dermis, and increased HLA-DR antigen and interleukin 2 receptor expression.' ^ The increased numbers of S100 positive cells in granuloma annulare lends some support to these findings, but the numbers are higher in necrobiosis Hpoidica and other known type IV delayed hypersensitivity reactions.\"^ In conclusion, an increase in the number of epidermal dendritic Sioo positive cells above the basal layer, as well as implicating a cell mediated immune-reaction, may provide an adjunct to histological means of distinguishing between necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare.FIGURE !. Dendritic S ioo protein positive cells seen within the epidermis in a case of necrobiosis lipoidica ( X 204).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nUsing this method, S100 positive, basal melanocytes were excluded. Counts were expressed as the number of epidermal dendritic Sioo positive cells per 200 basal cells.Student's unpaired r-test was used to assess statistical differences between necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare, and the control group.\nRESULTSAll the biopsies were of predominantly lesional skin.

Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) and other antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were tested for by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. Positive results for Scl 70 antibodies were obtained in 77% of cases of diffuse scleroderma and 44% of acrosclerosis. ACA and Scl 70 antibodies were found to be mutually exclusive. If acrosclerosis cases positive for anticentromere antibodies are excluded, the percentage of acrosclerosis cases positive for Scl 70 was 63%. ACA were found to be a marker of a benign, abortive subset of acrosclerosis with almost no cutaneous involvement (CREST), whereas Scl 70 did not discriminate between acrosclerosis and diffuse scleroderma. On HEp-2 cells Scl 70 positive sera gave a characteristic, fine speckled, almost homogeneous nuclear staining pattern. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNucleolar staining without any associated patterns was found in five cases, four of acrosclerosis and one of diffuse scleroderma, all negative for Scl 70.\nDISCUSSIONScl 70 antibody was found to be a specific serological marker of systemic scleroderma. In our series it was detected at a much higher frequency than reported in previous publications (Tan et al., 1980;Catoggio et al., 1983), but comparable results have been reported recently by Takehara,Moroi and Ishibashi (t985). The higher detection rates of Scl 70 in our study, 77\",, in 13652133, 1986, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j. 1365-2133.1986.tb06233.x by Hochschule Mannheim, Wiley Online Library on [05/03/2025].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, it is conceivable that Scl 70 antibody occurs even more frequently than detected in our study.In contrast to ACA antibody, which is a marker of an abortive subset of acrosclerosis with almost no cutaneous indurations (Chorzelski et al., 1985), Scl 70 is a marker of systemic sclerosis as a whole, with prevalence in diffuse scleroderma, but present also in a high proportion of cases of acrosclerosis. Thus, it does not discriminate between the subsets of systemic scleroderma. There were only slight clinical differences between cases positive and negative for Scl 70.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nConversely, patients with acrosclerosis negative for ACA were found to be positive for Scl 70 in 63\"(, cases, whereas in acrosclerosis patients as a whole Scl 70 antibody was present in 44\",, ofthe cases (Table 1).It should be emphasized that among 39 cases of diffuse scleroderma, 16 observed by us for more than 10 years were classified initially as severe acrosclerosis or transitional form, acrosclerosis-diffuse scleroderma. The frequency of Scl 70 antibody in this group was 12 of 16 C75\"o), ie. essentially the same as in typical cases of diffuse scleroderma. Therefore, the transitional form was grouped with diffuse scleroderma.Immunofiuorescence studies on HEp-2 showed a characteristic pattern with all sera positive in the immunodiffusion test for Scl 70 antibody. The fiuorescence pattern was almost homogeneous due to diffuse fine, densely packed speckles associated, in most cases, with weak nucleolar staining (Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These include TGF-\u03b1, a-FGF, b-FGF, PDGF, TGF-\u00df, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, NGF, TNF-ct, ILla, IL-l\u00df, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and MCSF.[citation 24]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The Biology of Skin Grafts \nAbstract: Background: Skin grafting is commonly used to treat nonhealing wounds. However, how skin grafts help to heal wounds is not entirely known. Why epithelium from grafted skin is able to migrate and cover these wounds, while epithelium at the edge of nonhealing wounds is unable to, is a long unanswered biologic question.\nObservations: The recent use of cultured epithelial allografts has rekindled interest in the biology of skin grafts. Replaced, even in chronic wounds, by recipient epithelium, cultured epithelial allografts appear to work by providing a potent stimulus to healing imparted by the graft itself. Based on this, we have reassessed how skin autografts help to heal wounds and hypothesize that, in a similar fashion, autografts may work not only by replacing tissue but also by providing a stimulus for healing.\nConclusions: We suggest that skin grafts may work not only as tissue replacement but as pharmacologic agents that provide a stimulus for healing. We believe that, someday, it may be possible to augment the stimulatory properties of donor skin to speed healing of the recipient wound. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n\"6 Other authors8,19 have noted this so-called edge effect, and some have also ex\u00ac pressed the idea that the epithelial cells elaborate growth factors responsible for the rapid reepithelial\u00ac ization of the wounds.20,21 If, as it appears, growth fac\u00ac tors are in some way responsible for the rapid healing of chronic ulcers after cultured epithelial allografting, then perhaps \"dosing\" of these growth factors with re- peated grafts may be important. Toward that end, Beele and coworkers22 were recently successful in treating chronic leg ulcers with repeated cultured epi\u00ac dermal allografts, suggesting that repeated \"doses\" are needed in some patients to aid in wound healing. They noted healing from the edge with each successive graft.It is possible that traditional skin grafting using the patient's own skin without in vitro expansion may work, in part, due to growth factors supplied by the patient's own healthy donor skin. The donor skin transplanted to a nonhealing chronic wound may bring with it factors or the capacity to elaborate factors ab\u00ac sent or deficient in the recipient area.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSurvival of cultured allogenic keratinocytes transplanted to deep dermal bed assessed with probe specific for Y chromosome\n\t\t\n\t\t\tABrain\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPPurkis\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPCoates\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMHackett\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHNavsaria\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tILeigh\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBMJ\n\t\t\n\t\t\t298\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1989\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tProduction and auto-induction of transforming growth factor-\\g=a\\ in human keratinocytes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCoffey RjJr\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRDerynck\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJNWilcox\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t328\n\t\t\t817\n\t\t\t1987\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCultured epithelial allografting of leg ulcers\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSShehade\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJClancy\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tABlight\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKYoung\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPLevick\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Dermatol Treat\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1989\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPossibly, the stratum corneum, which is known to act as a reser\u00ac voir,23 or other cells in the grafted tissue, may act as a transport for needed endogenous \"growth factors.\" It is well known that acute wounds produce growth fac\u00ac tors that stimulate healing.24 These factors supplied by the newly grafted skin may significantly contribute to the eventual healing of the wound. In addition, the newly grafted skin may serve to stimulate matrix for\u00ac mation or the release of inflammatory mediators. Most grafting techniques (pinch grafting or mesh grafting)do not cover all of the ulcer to conserve donor tissue.A continued stimulus for reepithelialization is required to resurface the remainder of the ulcer and is likely provided by the newly transplanted skin. This is con\u00ac sistent with previous observations made with regard to skin grafting. O'Donoghue and Zarem25 showed that free skin grafts become vascularized, suggesting that the grafted tissue causes host blood vessels to grow into the graft. They also noted that fresh grafts are more efficient at attracting blood vessels than frozen- thawed grafts, suggesting a donor-dependent process.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The location of the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. relative to the ostium of the celiac trunk was identified on the aortic wall. Following this, the locations of the ostia of the renal aa. on the internal wall of the abdominal aorta were examined relative to the ostia of the arteries mentioned earlier. The ostium of the superior mesenteric a. was usually localized on the inferior-fight side of the ostium of the celiac trunk. The mean value of the distance between the ostia was 17.9 mm. The ostium of the right renal a. was more cranial than the ostium of the left renal a. (53.3%). However, the ostia of both right and left renal aa. were at the same level in three cases (10%). Locations of the ostia of the renal aa. were usually on the lateral and anterolateral regions of the aortic wall. This study was carried out in order to contribute to selective angiography and surgical interventions for the removal and transplantation of organs, particularly of the kidney. Our results are compared with previous similar studies in man.  \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nto be 55.7% [10]. Our findings were more compatible with the findings of Odman and Ranniger, since the incidence of lateral and anterolateral locations were 48.3% and 31.6%, respectively. According to Odman and Ranniger, the ostium of the right renal a. was located more on the anterior wall and that of the left renal a. on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta. These authors also reported that renal aa. originating from the anterior wall had a more cranial position near the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. [ 10].We found that renal ostia on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta had a cranial, but ostia on the anterolateral wall a caudal position. This result accounted for the more cranial position of the right renal ostium in relation to the left renal ostium. Extreme (anterior or posterior wall) locations of renal ostia on the aortic wall have been reported to be related to developmental variations of the mesonephric aa.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFollowing this, the locations of the ostia of the renal aa. on the internal wall of the abdominal aorta were examined relative to the ostia of the arteries mentioned earlier.

We re-examine a breccia pipe in the Bushveld Complex to investigate the role of volatile fluid overpressure in its emplacement. This 10-m-diameter breccia pipe was emplaced vertically in the anorthosite of the Upper Critical Zone of the Bushveld Complex and contains blocks of Bushveld anorthosite, norite, and pyroxenite, apparently derived from lower in the stratigraphy. The blocks are commonly elongate, and are tightly packed within an ultramafic pegmatite groundmass. Ultramafic pegmatitic dikes radiate bilaterally from the pipe. Microprobe analyses of plagioclase in the breccia pipe blocks reveal that these grains are unzoned and have higher anorthosite content (~An85) than host rock plagioclase (~An75), indicating that the breccia pipe blocks were transported considerable vertical distances. Whole-rock major- and trace-element data show enrichment in fluid-soluble incompatible elements, supporting the role of volatile fluids in the formation of the pipe. A model is examined in which the segregation of a fluid phase from interstitial liquids in the cumulate section below the breccia pipe leads to the development of sufficient overpressure for its explosive emplacement. Fluid overpressure can develop by compaction and during crystallization of plagioclase-saturated silicate liquids as fluids exsolve from the solidifying interstitial liquid. If fluids separate faster than they can escape from the crystal pile, significant overpressures can develop. The minimum fluidization velocity which would be required to emplace blocks of the size and density found within the breccia pipe is found to be 10\u2013110 m/s. The crystallization model predicts the development of about 400 bar of overpressure, an amount calculated to be sufficient for pipe emplacement. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis overpressure is in addition to any overpressure from derived compaction in the crystallizing pile. Thus, as seen in Fig. 12, the base of the chamber comprises solid degassed cumulates, with no porosity. This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber.Because the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others. Fluids are likely to collect in those rocks which have significant residual porosity. These gas-rich regions may be interconnected via pegmatitic channel ways and fractures. Conversely, rocks with low permeability can act as ''caps'' preventing the escape of fluids. When an escape channel does develop, the fluid escapes violently.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn fact, pressure on the interstitial liquid drops dramatically. This decrease in pressure results from a net crystallization contraction in most crystallizing silicate phases -the solids take up less volume than the liquid (Peterson 1987). By contrast, in those isochoric runs where the crystallizing interstitial liquid is initially water saturated, significant overpressure can develop (Fig. 10). In all three cases, fluids were exsolved continually over the course of crystallization, but overpressure developed only when plagioclase joined the liquidus. This result is due to a relatively higher molar volume of plagioclase compared with that of the interstitial liquid. Thus, for overpressure to develop, the combined crystallization expansion of plagioclase and exsolution of water is required to overcome the crystallization contraction of the other crystallizing phases. Furthermore, the isochoric P-T plot of fluid-saturated magmas demonstrates that an overpressure of about 400 bar can be generated.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis can lead to an overpressured situation. For example, Burnham (1979) has shown how differentiation-induced redistribution of water in a magma body can lead to local vapor saturation and to the rapid upward migration of the vapor. Furthermore, the effect of degassing a fluid on magma pressures and on the eruption behavior of a shallow magma chamber has been examined by Tait et al. (1989). Boudreau (1992) broadened the discussion of the physical effects of the exsolution of a volatile phase by examining how degassing may cause overpressure in a solidifying crystal pile. In this study, we apply a crystallization model in order to determine how much overpressure is developed during the crystallization of a volatile, saturated interstitial liquid which crystallizes isochorically (constant volume).We applied the PELE silicate-liquid crystallization model of Boudreau (1999), a PC-platform program based on the MELTS thermodynamic model of Ghiorso and Sack (1995).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Because the liver is susceptible to toxin- or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth. Specifically, in response to injury, quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and undergo DNA replication to promote liver regrowth. Despite the elucidation of a number of regenerative factors, the mechanisms by which liver injury triggers hepatocyte proliferation are incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that eosinophils stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and toxin-mediated injury. Liver injury results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to promote the proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Surprisingly, signaling via the IL-4R\u03b1 in macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue repair, is dispensable for hepatocyte proliferation and liver regrowth after injury. Instead, IL-4 exerts its proliferative actions via IL-4R\u03b1 in hepatocytes. Our findings thus provide a unique mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInterestingly, signaling via the IL-4R\u03b1 in myeloid cells is not required for mediating the regenerative actions of type 2 cytokines in injured liver. Rather, type 2 cytokines stimulate liver regeneration, in part, via activation of the IL-4R\u03b1 on hepatocytes.\nResultsEosinophils Are Recruited to the Liver After Hepatic Injury. To identify potential immune cells that participate in liver regeneration, we examined the immune cell repertoire of regenerating livers. Injury induced by partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) led to a dramatic increase in the recruitment of innate immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Figs. S1 A and B, and S2), which coincided with the onset of hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the content of adaptive immune cells did not change significantly in these models of liver injury (Figs. S1 C and D and S2).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n4M). Although the initial extent of liver damage was similar in both groups of mice (Fig. S10A), hepatocyte proliferation, as fied by nuclear staining for K i 67 (Fig. S10B), was increased by \u223c22% in IL-4-treated animals (Fig. 4N). Furthermore, this increase in hepatocyte proliferation was associated with a \u223c43% decrease in necrotic cell area (Fig. 4O and Fig. S10C), suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of IL-4 in acute liver injury.\nDiscussionThe regenerative capacity of the liver in part reflects its susceptibility to damage by ingested toxins and pathogenic infections. As such, multiple homeostatic mechanisms are activated on injury to initiate liver regeneration, each contributing only partially to the restoration of liver function (1,2). Here, we have demonstrated a role for eosinophils in orchestrating the regrowth of liver after injury. Moreover, our work has elucidated a direct mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 signals via the hepatocyte IL-4R\u03b1 to stimulate liver regeneration.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nS4 A and B). These results highlight a previously unappreciated role for eosinophils in inducing hepatocyte proliferation after injury and implicate eosinophil-derived factors in the orchestration of liver regeneration.Eosinophils Recruited to Injured Liver Secrete IL-4. Among the factors secreted by eosinophils, IL-4 has been implicated in both wound repair and liver regeneration (8,12,(19)(20)(21). We thus evaluated the competence of eosinophils for IL-4 secretion in injured liver. After CCl 4 -induced liver injury, eosinophils, which can be distinguished by their expression of sialic acid-binding Ig receptor (Siglec-F) (15), were the predominant cell type competent for IL-4 secretion (Fig. 2A and Fig. S5B) in IL-4 reporter mice (4get mice), a knock-in strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the IL-4 locus (22). Similarly, partial hepatectomy in 4get mice demonstrated that \u223c81-84% of GFP + cells were eosinophils (Fig. 2B and Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These include nanobainite steel [citation 36].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The role of retained austenite on tensile properties of steels with bainitic microstructures \nAbstract: In high-carbon, silicon-rich steels it is possible to obtain a very fine bainitic microstructure by transformation at low temperatures (200\u2013300\u00b0C). This microstructure consists of slender ferrite plates, with thicknesses of several tens of nm, in a matrix of retained austenite. Whereas strength is mainly provided by to the fine scale of the ferrite plates (stronger phase), ductility is mostly controlled by the retained austenite (softer phase). Further improvement in ductility is achieved by strain induced transformation of austenite to martensite, the so called TRIP effect. In order to take full advantage of this effect, the mechanical stability of the austenite, i.e., its capability to transform to martensite under strain, must not be too low nor excessively high.\nTwo main aspects of the mechanical stability of the retained austenite, morphology and chemical composition, have been studied to determine the role that these play on the ductility behaviour of the bainitic steels studied. It is suggested that the chemical composition has the strongest effect on the ductility of these new high strength alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTable 33Summary of experimental data from tensile tests at room temperature.

It can be clearly seen that the tensile properties reported in this work has never before been achieved in bainitic steels.It has been suggested 12) that in this type of low temperature bainitic microstructures the main strengthening mechanism is intimately related to the very small thickness of the ferrite plates and to its high dislocation density. The former gives the largest contribution, up to 1.6 GPa, while a maximum of 500 MPa is estimated to be provided by the dislocation density.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consequently, we developed new formalisms from known acid and Mg2+ dissociation constants by which the observed chemical shift of Pi, deltaPi, and the peak height ratio of the beta- and alpha-ATP resonances, hbeta/alpha, could be related to free [Mg2+] by simultaneous solution of: [equation: see text] We found that hbeta/alpha changed 2.5-fold as free [Mg2+] varied from 0.25 to 1.5 mM, providing a more sensitive and accurate measure of free cytosolic [Mg2+]. In working rat heart perfused with glucose, free [Mg2+] was 1.0 +/- 0.1 from hbeta/alpha and 1.2 +/- 0.03 from measured [citrate]/[isocitrate] but 0.51 +/- 0.1 from deltaalphabeta. Addition of ketone bodies to the perfusate decreased free [Mg2+] estimated from hbeta/alpha to 0.61 +/- 0.02 and 0.74 +/- 0.11 by [citrate]/[isocitrate] but the estimate from deltaalphabeta was unchanged at 0.46 +/- 0.04 mM.

We assess the biophysical option space for feeding the world in 2050 in a hypothetical zero-deforestation world. We systematically combine realistic assumptions on future yields, agricultural areas, livestock feed and human diets. For each scenario, we determine whether the supply of crop products meets the demand and whether the grazing intensity stays within plausible limits. We find that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without deforestation, even at low crop-yield levels. Within the option space, individual scenarios differ greatly in terms of biomass harvest, cropland demand and grazing intensity, depending primarily on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human diets. Grazing constraints strongly limit the option space. Without the option to encroach into natural or semi-natural land, trade volumes will rise in scenarios with globally converging diets, thereby decreasing the food self-sufficiency of many developing regions. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nGlobal diets link environmental sustainability and human health\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDTilman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMClark\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t515\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDelivering food security without increasing pressure on land\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPSmith\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGlob.

However, because of their large feed requirements, efficiency gains in livestock systems that are based on the enhanced use of croplandderived concentrate feedstuff can also aggravate land competition for food production 8,28,32 . In contrast, the use of land that is not directly usable for food production with ruminants has an important potential to contribute to food security and the maintenance of livelihoods in specific contexts [33][34][35] . This plurality of viewpoints warrants a systematic exploration of the interplay of  factors such as diets, yields and livestock efficiencies for agricultural development.In particular, constraints to grazing become decisive in a zero-deforestation world. In that situation, cropland expansion can expand to unused, unforested land-which is typically of low productivity due to climate constraints and of high nature value (then, its conversion entails high ecological costs)-or, more likely, to other areas, that is, areas not used for cropping and infrastructure.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis result indicates that deforestation is not a precondition for supplying the world with sufficient food in terms of quantity and quality in 2050 and that many options exist based on different strategies. Our analysis reveals that even a global adoption of diets currently prevailing in the Western world would be feasible without deforestation if cropland yields rose massively and cropland expanded strongly into areas that are today used for grazing. Furthermore, high yields 17 are no biophysical necessity; the world population can be fed healthily even with low cropland yields and little cropland expansion when diets with a reduced fraction of livestock products are adopted.According to our analysis, human diets are the strongest determinant of the biophysical option space, stronger than yields or cropland availability. Unsurprisingly, vegan diets and diets with a low share of livestock products (for example, the VEGETARIAN variant) show the largest number of feasible scenarios, in line with other studies 19,33,40 , representing pathways that also make it possible to avoid the otherwise virulent grazing constraints and significantly reduce the option space.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Combined with their antigen presentation capacity, this powerful functionality enables pDCs to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. pDCs combine features of both lymphocytes and classical dendritic cells and display unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and IFN production. In the decade since the identification of the pDC as a distinct immune cell type, our understanding of its molecular underpinnings and role in immunity has progressed rapidly. Here we review select aspects of pDC biology including cell fate establishment and plasticity, specific molecular mechanisms of pDC function, and the role of pDCs in T cell responses, antiviral immunity, and autoimmune diseases. Important unresolved questions remain in these areas, promising exciting times in pDC research for years to come. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSome of the players are known, including pDCenriched transcription factors Irf8 and SpiB. Both genes represent direct targets of E2-2 (32), although their own binding targets and precise role in pDC development and/or function remain to be established. Others, such as the highly pDC-enriched transcription factor Runx2 (25) and other candidates, must be characterized from scratch. Finally, it should be of interest to elucidate the epigenetic events (e.g., chromatin modifications) that accompany pDC commitment, maintenance, and activation.\nA Novel pDC-Related Dendritic Cell SubsetA simple linear view of E2-2-driven pDC development recently became more complicated, as a novel pDC-related cDC subset in mice was identified using Cx3cr1 as a marker (60). Unlike the classical CD8 + cDCs, the alternative CD8-expressing Cx3cr1 + cDCs develop independently of transcription factor Batf3, do not cross-present antigen, and cannot be expanded by Flt3L.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nImportantly, pDCs show particularly low expression of the E protein inhibitor Id2, in contrast to abundant Id2 expression in T,NK, and myeloid cells (25,32). The absence of Id2 expression likely serves as an important counterpart of E2-2 upregulation, increasing the effective E2-2 concentration in pDCs (Figure 1).Every lineage commitment step involves the establishment of a lineage-specific gene expression program, as well as the suppression of alternative lineage programs. Our recent genome-wide analysis of E2-2 binding to promoters in the human pDC cell line (57) suggests that E2-2 is directly involved in both activities. We found that E2-2 binds to a large fraction of pDC-enriched genes, including highly pDC-specific genes such as LILRA4 (ILT7) (58) and PACSIN1 (59). In addition, E2-2 appears to bind directly to and repress several hallmark genes of the alternative cDC fate, such as ITGAX (CD11C) and ID2 itself.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFurthermore, the isolation of human pDCs based on their specific marker BDCA-2 (an inhibitory receptor) impairs their IFN production capacity. To boost the frustratingly low pDC numbers in mice, many studies inject a Flt3 ligand (Flt3L)-expressing melanoma cell line (40). This approach should be discouraged because the resulting gross tumor and supraphysiological Flt3L levels likely affect pDC ground state and functionality. Another practical consideration involves gene targeting in mice: Some Crerecombinase-expressing deleter strains such as the T cell-specific CD4-Cre strain mediate efficient off-target recombination in pDCs (41).

[citation 23]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: A census of human transcription factors: Function, expression and evolution \nAbstract: Transcription factors are key cellular components that control gene expression: their activities determine how cells function and respond to the environment. Currently, there is great interest in research into human transcriptional regulation. However, surprisingly little is known about these regulators themselves. For example, how many transcription factors does the human genome contain? How are they expressed in different tissues? Are they evolutionarily conserved? Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation. Much remains to be explored, but this study provides a solid foundation for future investigations to elucidate regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse mammalian biological processes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFinally, we also included 27 curated probable TFs from other sources, such as GO or TRANSFAC 33 ; these TFs contain undefined DNAbinding domains, and were therefore missed using the above procedure.This resulted in a highconfidence data set of 1,391 genomic loci (~6% of the total number of protein coding genes) that encode TFs, which we will focus on for the remainder of this Analysis article, and a further 216 loci representing possible TFs (see Supplementary information S3 (.txt file) for the data set). estimates of the coverage of our approach range from 85% to 94% (Supplementary information S1 (PDF)) suggesting an upper bound of ~1,700-1,900 TFcoding genes in the human genome.Despite the care that we have taken in compiling this data set, there are a few possible sources of inaccura cies. Our method depends heavily on the content of the InterPro database, and the ability of the search algo rithms to detect these domains in protein sequences. The repertoire should be updated when new InterPro entries for newly discovered DNAbinding domains, or refinements of existing ones, and more sensitive search methods become available.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis type of information will be revealed through further experiments and advances in the methods used to determine the transcriptional regulatory networks.\nConclusionsThis Analysis article has presented a census of sequence specific DNAbinding TFs in the human genome. Transcriptional regulation in higher organisms is of great current research interest; however, much of the work so far has focused on identifying binding sites through a combination of experimental methods, such as chroma tin immunoprecipitation and computational predictions using motif searches. A major limitation to studying the regulators themselves has been the lack of a reliable data set of TFs in the human genome, a difficulty that is com pounded by the large number of false predictions that can accompany the automated identification of genes encod ing DNAbinding domains. By manually inspecting every entry in the data set, we have minimized such errors. As a result the repertoire here is of high quality, and can be used as a basis to design further computational and experimental studies.Most of these TFs remain uncharacterized: this is highlighted by the observation that just three regulators (p53, eR and FOS) have more publications than all the other TFs put together.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis group of proteins mapped to 1,960 human genomic loci in the ensembl Genome Browser database (release 51) 32 .Next, we manually inspected each locus and grouped them according to our confidence in their TF func tionality (Supplementary information S1 (PDF); the full data set is found in Supplementary information S3 (.txt file)): at the highest level, probable TFs have experi mental evidence for regulatory function in any mam malian organism or have an equivalent protein domain arrangement; possible TFs contain nonpromiscuous InterPro DNAbinding domains that are never found in nonTFs, but for which we do not have further func tional evidence; and unlikely TFs comprise predicted genes, genes containing promiscuous InterPro DNA binding domains or genes with an established molecular function other than transcription (such as nucleoporins, threonine phosphatases or splicing factors).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many of the structural matrix materials that are currently utilized at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, such as solution deposited, high-k dielectrics and commercial photoresists, exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the 8\u201312 \u03bcm spectral range which represents a significant challenge to developing transmissive, three-dimensional (3D) metamaterials operating in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectral region. In this paper, we present new, low loss photopatternable polymer dielectrics as well-suited matrix materials for fabricating LWIR-metamaterials. These materials are synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees followed by a thiol-ene coupling reaction to cross-link the remaining olefin groups. After cross-linking, the olefin LWIR-absorption band is minimized and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the material increases. Thick layers of the polymer (>3 \u03bcm), which acts as a negative photoresist, can be deposited easily using a spin coating technique to develop planarizing layers with photopatternable vias. A demonstration on the low loss nature of the polymer dielectrics was carried out by incorporating the polymer into an all-dielectric, infrared metamaterial. Thus, the material is ideal for both lithography and fabrication of 3D metamaterial structures operating in the LWIR spectral region. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis peak is associated with a small amount of unreacted olefin remaining in the polymer. Ultimately, though, the polymer had little influence on the overall metamaterial loss due to a lack of strong absorptions in the 8-12 mm spectral range. This is in contrast to commercially available photopatternable polymers that have much higher losses. 22,27 \nConclusionsIn summary, novel low loss photopatternable polymer dielectric materials were synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees and using the thiol-ene coupling Fig. 6 Cross-section view of an all-dielectric infrared metamaterial taken using SEM (left) and transmission spectra for the same metamaterial before and after adding the optimum polymer material (right). The polymer, shown in black in the SEM has a flat surface and planarizes well over etched tellurium cubes. Though the electric resonance (E1) and magnetic resonance (H1) shifts to a slightly higher wavelength when the polymer is present (red line), there is minimal attenuation of the resonant fields overall.reaction to cross-link the remaining olefin groups.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMany of the structural matrix materials that are currently utilized at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, such as solution deposited, high-k dielectrics and commercial photoresists, exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the 8-12 mm spectral range which represents a significant challenge to developing transmissive, threedimensional (3D) metamaterials operating in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectral region.

These materials are synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees followed by a thiol-ene coupling reaction to crosslink the remaining olefin groups. After cross-linking, the olefin LWIR-absorption band is minimized and the glass transition temperature (T g ) of the material increases. Thick layers of the polymer (>3 mm), which acts as a negative photoresist, can be deposited easily using a spin coating technique to develop planarizing layers with photopatternable vias.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, the ideal dielectric matrix material for LWIRmetamaterial applications would be simultaneously low-loss, low-index, and allow for solution deposition for simple planarization. Low loss photopatternable polymer dielectics appear to be a promising solution. However, off-the-shelf commerically available photoresist polymers also exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the optical regime. 27 An ideal polymer dielectric would have losses comparable to polyethylene but have the additional benefits of a resist in that it is compatible with 3D fabrication techniques, photopatternable, and high temperature process tolerant. 28 We have identified a route to a tunable matrix material which satisfies each of these requirements in the thermal infrared spectral region (8-12 mm). 29,30 The materials are synthesized using the ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene followed by a partial hydrogenation to remove most of the IR absorbing olefin groups in the 8-12 mm range (Scheme 1). Photopatterning of these materials can then be achieved using the remaining olefin groups via a thiol-ene coupling reaction.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This aphotic ecosystem is anoxic and consists of a slightly acidic (pH 6.2) sodium chloride-dominated brine. Expeditions in 2005 and 2010 were conducted to investigate the biogeochemistry of Lake Vida\u2019s brine system. A phylogenetically diverse and metabolically active Bacteria dominated microbial assemblage was observed in the brine. These bacteria live under very high levels of reduced metals, ammonia, molecular hydrogen (H2), and dissolved organic carbon, as well as high concentrations of oxidized species of nitrogen (i.e., supersaturated nitrous oxide and \u223c1 mmol\u22c5L\u22121 nitrate) and sulfur (as sulfate). The existence of this system, with active biota, and a suite of reduced as well as oxidized compounds, is unusual given the millennial scale of its isolation from external sources of energy. The geochemistry of the brine suggests that abiotic brine-rock reactions may occur in this system and that the rich sources of dissolved electron acceptors prevent sulfate reduction and methanogenesis from being energetically favorable. The discovery of this ecosystem and the in situ biotic and abiotic processes occurring at low temperature provides a tractable system to study habitability of isolated terrestrial cryoenvironments (e.g., permafrost cryopegs and subglacial ecosystems), and is a potential analog for habitats on other icy worlds where water-rock reactions may cooccur with saline deposits and subsurface oceans. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis brine has been isolated by the thick lake ice cover and underlying 800-970 m of permafrost (11,12), prohibiting input of ground water or of annual glacial melt and associated nutrients. 14 C-dating of organic matter sampled at 12 m in the lake ice cover suggests that the brine has been isolated for more than 2,800 y (10). The Lake Vida brine represents a cryoecosystem that is a suitable, accessible analog for glacial and subglacial systems, including soils, sediments, wetlands, and lakes underlying the Antarctic ice sheet, some of which may harbor saline waters at depth (13), and for the icy worlds of our solar system. The goal of the present study is to examine the inorganic and organic geochemistry as well as the biology of the brine and determine the capacity of this sealed, aphotic cryoecosystem for harboring and sustaining microbial life.\nResults and DiscussionDuring coring of the lake ice in 2005, brine infiltrated the borehole 16.0 m below the surface of the ice.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMicrobial characterization of a subzero, hypersaline methane seep in the Canadian High Arctic\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTDNiederberger\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tISME J\n\t\t\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe deep, dark energy biosphere: Intraterrestrial life on Earth\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKEdwards\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKBecker\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFColwell\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnnu Rev Earth Planet Sci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t40\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2012\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFormation and character of an ancient 19-m ice cover and underlying trapped brine in an \"ice-sealed\" east Antarctic lake\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPTDoran\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCHFritsen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCPMckay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJCPriscu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEEAdams\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProc Natl Acad Sci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t100\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2003\n\t\t\tUSA\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMicrobial communities in these conditions are often sustained by a supply of energy that ultimately derives from photosynthesis (present or past).

Methane derived from thermogenic or biogenic sources can also support microbial communities in deep sea (7) and high arctic cold saline seeps (8). More recently, discoveries of life and associated processes in deep terrestrial subsurface ecosystems (9) provide compelling evidence of subsurface life that in some cases is fueled by nonphotosynthetic processes.

[citation 17].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Controlling fast transport of cold trapped ions \nAbstract: We realize fast transport of ions in a segmented microstructured Paul trap. The ion is shuttled over a distance of more than 10(4) times its ground state wave function size during only five motional cycles of the trap (280 \u03bcm in 3.6 \u03bcs). Starting from a ground-state-cooled ion, we find an optimized transport such that the energy increase is as low as 0.10\u00b10.01 motional quanta. In addition, we demonstrate that quantum information stored in a spin-motion entangled state is preserved throughout the transport. Shuttling operations are concatenated, as a proof-of-principle for the shuttling-based architecture to scalable ion trap quantum computing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSo far, ion shuttling in a multiplexed trap has been demonstrated together with additional sympathetic cooling [7], and in the adiabatic regime, where the transient displacement of the ion is smaller than the size of the its wavepacket [8,9]. Transport of neutral atoms have also been performed using magnetic [10] or optical [11] techniques.Because quantum gate operations require ions close to the motional ground state and fast transport inherently creates motional excitation, the challenge is to develop transport protocols that guarantee sufficiency small energy transfer. In this work we demonstrate shuttling operations that are highly non-adiabatic while the final state of the ion is close to the motional groundstate. We also show that quantum information stored in both the motional and the spin degree of freedom is preserved through the shuttling.During a shuttling operation, the ion motion in the harmonic trapping potential is excited when the acceleration is sufficiently strong. This motional excitation is a harmonic oscillation, characterized by a well defined phase, thus allowing it to be canceled out by proper management of the forces involved during or after the transport. We experimentally demonstrate two methods of canceling the acquired motional excitation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe experimentally demonstrate two methods of canceling the acquired motional excitation. One method uses two shuttles, where the transport to the destination generates the same net momentum transfer as the transport back, but is applied 180 \u2022 out of phase with respect to the secular oscillation of the ion (Fig. 1b). We refer to this as the pairwise energy-neutral transport. For the second scheme, the self-neutral transport we apply a sharp counter-\"kick\" to the ion at the end of a single transport operation, stopping its motion (Fig. 1c). This case of single-sided transport allows even faster shuttling and can be sequentially repeated since it is energy selfneutral, making it the preferred building block for scalable quantum information protocols.The experiments are carried out in a micro-structured segmented Paul trap [12], where the trapping voltage applied to each electrode segment is controlled by an FPGA-based arbitrary waveform generator that allows high resolution for both timing and voltage, while having low noise ( 10nV/ \u221a Hz at the trap frequency). Further noise reduction at high frequencies is done with a \u03a0-type filter having a cut-off frequency of 300 kHz.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nShuttling operations are concatenated, as a proof-of-principle for the shuttling-based architecture to scalable ion trap quantum computing.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nThe field of quantum information began its experimental uprise with the proposal from Cirac and Zoller [1] in 1995, extended by the prospect of scalability of ion trap based systems [2] via shuttling of qubits in multiplexed traps along the ideas pioneered by Wineland [3]. Scalable information processing in a multiplexed ion trap can be accomplished by having fixed processing sites where logic operations are performed, and ion qubits will be moved in and out of these regions by shuttling operations. The duration of such shuttling has to be much faster than the relevant decoherence times [4]. Furthermore, it is desirable to reduce the total time consumption of all relevant operations, where shuttling will contribute a considerable amount [5], and aim for the performance of the naturally fast solid state architectures [6].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Therefore, specific crystallographic symmetries or lattice parameters can only be achieved using specific nanoparticles as building blocks (and vice versa). We present six design rules that can be used to deliberately prepare nine distinct colloidal crystal structures, with control over lattice parameters on the 25- to 150-nanometer length scale. These design rules outline a strategy to independently adjust each of the relevant crystallographic parameters, including particle size (5 to 60 nanometers), periodicity, and interparticle distance. As such, this work represents an advance in synthesizing tailorable macroscale architectures comprising nanoscale materials in a predictable fashion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor example, one can synthesize different sets of nanoparticles that are identical in terms of their elemental composition, but vary in size or shape [2 -8]; alternatively, one can synthesize two nanoparticles that are structurally identical at the nanometer scale, but are composed of different atomic constituents [4, 9 -16]. This versatility provides significantly greater programmability in building block design, and, subsequently, in materials synthesis. However, the challenge associated with using nanoparticles as building blocks is that nanoparticles do not inherently have components that allow them to bond to one another in the manner that electrons allow for atomic bonds to be created. Therefore, to assemble nanoparticles into hierarchical structures, ligands must be attached to the surface of the nanoparticles to dictate how nanoparticles interact with each other [17 -22]. Many different ligands have been utilized to achieve this, taking control of ionic [20], van der Waals [21 -22], or biological recognition interactions [17,18] to dictate nanoparticle bonding patterns. An ideal ligand choice to achieve these types of interactions is DNA.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe third rule for DNA-programmed assembly is: In a binary system based upon complementary SNA-NPs, favored products will tend to have equivalent numbers of each complementary DNA sequence, evenly spaced throughout a unit cell.In order to achieve more complex crystallographic symmetries, DNA and nanoparticle combinations must be used where, unlike the fcc, bcc, and CsCl lattices mentioned previously, nanoparticle assembly behavior is not equivalent for the two particles in a binary system. This is most readily achieved by changing the ratio of the hydrodynamic sizes of the particles, or by changing the relative number of DNA strands on each particle. The size ratio affects the packing of the SNA-NPs by controlling where particles are positioned relative to one another. For example, a particle with a large hydrodynamic radius can be surrounded by a large number of particles with a relatively small hydrodynamic radius, but each small particle can only be surrounding by a few larger particles; one would therefore predict that the most favored unit cell for this pairing would have a particle stoichiometry that favors the presence of a larger number of the smaller particles. The ratio of the number of DNA strands on each particle type has a different, but equally important effect.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThey possess both properties associated with their inorganic core, such as plasmon resonances in the case of noble metals, and the programmable recognition capabilities of DNA. Importantly, they also possess emergent properties that are a direct result of attaching a dense layer of DNA strands to the surface of a nano-object, including enhanced binding strengths [30], innate cellular uptake [31], and greater discrimination against nucleobase sequence mismatch [32]. These enhanced properties have enabled their use in multiple applications, including low limit of detection diagnostics [33] and gene regulation [34].Since the development of the SNA-NP conjugate in 1996, the Mirkin group, along with others, have taken major strides in being able to utilize this structure as a building block in the synthesis of ordered arrays of nanoparticles. Although early attempts yielded materials that exhibited no long range ordering, short-range ordering and interparticle distance control was demonstrated in subsequent years [35]. Long-range ordering and crystalline materials were achieved for the first time in 2008 by altering the SNA-NP design to utilize DNA linker strands to connect the nanoparticles [36].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA Primer to Single-Particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYCheng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNGrigorieff\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPPenczek\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWalz\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.050\n\t\t25910204\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t161\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2015\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVolta potential phase plate for infocus phase contrast transmission electron microscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRDanev\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBBuijsse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMKhoshouei\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJMPlitzko\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWBaumeister\n\t\t\n\t\tpnas.1418377111\n\t\n\t\n\t\tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t1073\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDetermination of astigmatism in TEM images\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKVFernando\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSDFuller\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ StructBiol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t157\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2007\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAutomated determination of parameters describing power spectra of micrograph images in electron microscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZHuang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPRBaldwin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSMullapudi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPAPenczek\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.jsb.2003.10.011\n\t\t14643211\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Structural Biology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t144\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2003\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tACE: automated CTF estimation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSPMallick\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBCarragher\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCSPotter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDJKriegman\n\t\t\n\t\t15935913\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUltramicroscopy\n\t\t\n\t\t\t104\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2005\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSingleparticle electron cryo-microscopy: towards atomic resolution\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVan Heel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBGowen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMatadeen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEVOrlova\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRFinn\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTPape\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDCohen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHStark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSchmidt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSchatz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPatwardhan A\n\t\t\n\t\t11233408\n\t\n\t\n\t\tQuarterly reviews of biophysics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMVan Heel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGHarauz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEVOrlova\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSchmidt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMSchatz\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1006/jsbi.1996.0004\n\t\t8742718\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of structural biology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t116\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1996\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Among the four vulture species breeding in the western Palaearctic, the species showing the steepest population decline, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, is a long-distance migrant wintering in Africa. However, the flyways and wintering areas of the species are only known for some populations, and without knowledge of where mortality occurs, effective conservation management is not possible. We tracked 19 juvenile Egyptian Vultures from the declining breeding population on the Balkan Peninsula between 2010 and 2014 to estimate survival and identify important migratory routes and wintering areas for this species. Mortality during the first autumn migration was high (monthly survival probability 0.75) but mortality during migration was exclusively associated with suboptimal navigation. All birds from western breeding areas and three birds from central and eastern breeding areas attempted to fly south over the Mediterranean Sea, but only one in 10 birds survived this route, probably due to stronger tailwind. All eight birds using the migratory route via Turkey and the Middle East successfully completed their first autumn migration. Of 14 individual and environmental variables examined to explain why juvenile birds did or did not successfully complete their first migration, the natal origin of the bird was the most influential. We speculate that in a declining population with fewer experienced adults, an increasing proportion of juvenile birds are forced to migrate without conspecific guidance, leading to high mortality as a consequence of following sub-optimal migratory routes. Juvenile Egyptian Vultures wintered across a vast range of the Sahel and eastern Africa, and had large movement ranges with core use areas at intermediate elevations in savannah, cropland or desert. Two birds were shot in Africa, where several significant threats exist for vultures at continental scales. Given the broad distribution of the birds and threats, effective conservation in Africa will be challenging and will require long-term investment. We recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nyears, however, there has been increasing awareness that events during migration or on wintering grounds can affect populations of migratory animals (Newton 2004, Studds & Marra 2005, Both et al. 2006). Identifying migration routes, stopover areas and wintering areas for migratory species that are declining is therefore necessary for designing effective conservation strategies that can address threats operating outside breeding areas (Wilcove & Wikelski 2008).The decline of long-distance migrants has been most apparent for passerines and smaller-bodied birds but there is evidence that long-distance migratory raptors are also declining (Hoffman & Smith 2003). Among the four vulture species that breed in the western Palaearctic, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is the only longdistance migrant that travels to wintering regions in sub-Saharan Africa (Porter & Beaman 1985, Meyburg et al. 2004, Garc \u0131a-Ripoll es et al. 2010).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe difficulty in finding experienced migrants may force inexperienced juveniles to follow their migratory instincts to reach Africa by heading in a southerly direction, as has been found in other soaring migrants (Chernetsov et al. 2004). Such a strategy is riskier for birds from western breeding areas, where the shortest route will lead the birds either via the Peloponnese or via islands in the Aegean Sea across a > 250-km stretch of open water to the coast of northern Africa, an exceptional strategy for a large raptor that may only be viable in very favourable wind conditions (Bildstein 2006, Agostini et al. 2015). In contrast, birds from more eastern breeding populations reach Turkey via the Bosphorus or the Dardanelles when heading in a southerly direction. To avoid the hazardous route over the Mediterranean, the Table 4. Mean proportion of habitat types and environmental variables at winter locations within the core 50% utilization distribution, compared with locations within winter movement ranges of wintering juvenile Egyptian Vultures in Africa.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWintering home-ranges were based on 50% kernel utilization distributions, and movement ranges were based on 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP). Relative variable importance was calculated using a permutation procedure based on a random forest model classifying locations as core range locations. GPP: general primary productivity. birds from more western breeding areas would require an initial departure towards a non-intuitive northeasterly direction to migrate around the northern coast of the Aegean Sea. Such a detour might be facilitated by following experienced birds, as has been suggested for other soaring migrants detouring around the Mediterranean (Mellone et al. 2011, Panuccio et al. 2012).Although there is no evidence that social facilitation or reliance on experienced migrants is a crucial element for successful migration of juvenile Egyptian Vultures, several migration patterns that can be observed in the region are consistent with the proposition that juveniles may benefit from following adult birds along a flyway through continental Turkey. First, adult and juvenile migration phenology matches temporally, with a peak for both age groups between 8 and 24 September in southern Turkey (Sutherland & Brooks 1981, Oppel et al. 2014).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This device achieves a dynamic range of 10(7), single-nucleotide-variant detection below one copy per 100,000 wild-type sequences and the discrimination of a 1% difference in chromosome copy number. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nQuantitative (q)PCR is the current gold standard for DNA measurement and genetic diagnostics but remains poorly suited to measurements of absolute concentration, has a limited precision (~20%), and presents difficulties in reliably detecting low-copy-number templates due to nonspecific amplification and competitive side reactions. qPCR measurements are thus inadequate for demanding applications such as early detection of cancer and monitoring of residual disease [1], analysis of single-cell gene expression [2], and the diagnosis of fetal genetic disorders using small allelic imbalances in circulating DNA.\nTHEORYA promising solution to such measurement problems is digital PCR [3], a single-molecule counting technique. Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample at limiting dilution followed by PCR amplification and endpoint detection to identify the presence or absence of template molecules in each reaction. All performance metrics of digital PCR, including sensitivity, precision and dynamic range, improve with the total number of digital reactions performed. Assuming a random distribution of single molecules and reliable detection of single molecules, it may be shown that the expected response, precision, and dynamic range of digital PCR are respectively given by ( 1), ( 2) and ( 3):(1)( ) 2 1 2 1 1 1 6 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n4 / - = \u2206 - - \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb e N (2) ) 10 / ln( N N DR = (3)Where, N is the number of chambers, \u03bb is the average number of molecules per chamber, x is the number positive chambers, N\u03bb is the best estimate of copy number, \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb is the fractional precision, and DR denotes the dynamic range of measurement. Assay density, scale and reduced volume are thus critical to the development of next-generation digital PCR systems. Microfluidics offer attractive platforms for digital PCR by providing reduced reaction volumes, increased throughput, higher single-molecule detection efficiency, reduced contamination, and reduced cost.\nEXPERIMENTALMegapixel microfluidic devices having 1,000,000 digital reaction chambers (Figure 1a) were fabricated using multilayer soft lithography [4] with modifications to allow for the inclusion of an embedded parylene C layer (~2\u00b5m) to prevent excessive dehydration (Figure 1b). Reaction components, including PCR master mix, probes, primers, and templates were assembled and mixed off chip prior to analysis in microfluidic digital PCR arrays.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe next evaluated the precision of our device in detecting small allelic imbalances by measuring the relative copy number of the HLCS and RPPH1 genes in normal human genomic DNA spiked with varying amounts of trisomy 21 (T21) genomic DNA ranging from 6% to 2%. Reliable discrimination of 2% and 3% enrichment was obtained reproducibly using sub-arrays of 100,000 chambers, while 1% enrichment was only well-resolved using full 1,000,000 chamber arrays.\nCONCLUSIONIn addition to enabling new measurements in biomedical research and diagnostics, the high assay density in our device has important implications for the adoption of digital PCR as a routine analytical tool. Thus, we contend that megapixel digital PCR or similar high-density formats will ultimately replace real-time qPCR as the standard analytical tool for absolute DNA measurement.Figure 1 :1Figure 1: (a) Schematic of megapixel digital PCR device, with insets showing the array and chamber geometries.

In particular, the remarkable device efficiency is strongly influenced by the perovskite crystallinity and the film morphology. Here, we investigate the perovskites crystallisation kinetics and growth mechanism in real time from liquid precursor continually to the final uniform film. We utilize some advanced in situ characterisation techniques including synchrotron-based grazing incident X-ray diffraction to observe crystal structure and chemical transition of perovskites. The nano-assemble model from perovskite intermediated [PbI6]4- cage nanoparticles to bulk polycrystals is proposed to understand perovskites formation at a molecular- or nano-level. A crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic crystallisation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these in situ dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation and transformation from the molecular to the microstructure over relevant temperature and time scales is successfully demonstrated. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe 60 \u00b0C-processed thin film with smaller size droplets were still not continuous. At 80 \u00b0C, the film showed slightly enlarged droplets, many of which merged together to form larger domains. When the heating temperature was increased to 100 \u00b0C, a highly regular, banded topography with a period of B2 mm was seen (Supplementary Figs 10 and11). The height variation of this periodic structure at the surface, that is, the amplitude, was B200 nm (Supplementary Fig. 10). At the centre of these banded structures, a plateau consisting of nanoscopic crystallites was also observed. These structures are very much akin to spherlitic textures seen in semi-crystalline polymers and metals [35][36][37] , where a radial growth of crystals emanates from a nucleus, and as the crystals grow outward, the growth fronts impinge on each other, arresting the crystallisation, forming the polygonal textures. The sizes and shapes of the polygonal structures are dictated by the areal density of nucleation 35 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFormation mechanism and control of perovskite films from solution to crystalline phase studied by in situ synchrotron scattering\n\t\t\n\t\t\tC.-YChang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tY.-CHuang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tC.-STsao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tW.-FSu\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tACS Appl.

These results imply that the perovskite films studied in this research have comparable optoelectronic properties as the films fabricated with traditional spin-coating process 43 , indicative of great potential for large-area devices based on printing fabrictaion. Consequently, the banded texture of the perovskite films is dictated by nucleation, which decreases with increasing temperature, hence the increase in the size of the structures, and a radial growth rate of the crystals, G, with dimension of length/time, and the diffusion of materials to the growth front, D, with dimension (length) 2 /time. The ratio of D/G defines a length that characterizes the period of the banded structures. This feature is similar to rhythmic crystallisation seen in soft materials 41,42 .\nDiscussionIn summary, this study revealed the material transformation and morphology formation of perovskites from precursor solution to the polycrystalline film over relevant temperature and time scales.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Two of these, mNeptune2 and mNeptune2.5, demonstrate improved maturation and brighter fluorescence than mNeptune, whereas the third, mCardinal, has a red-shifted excitation spectrum without reduction in brightness. We show that mCardinal can be used to non-invasively and longitudinally visualize the differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes in living mice with high anatomical detail. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe purified and digested PCR products were ligated into similarly digested pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-N1 cloning vectors to create pmCardinal-C1 and pmCardinal-N1. A cDNA fragment encoding each protein domain was PCR amplified with primers containing the appropriate restriction enzyme sites and ligated into pmCardinal-C1 or pmCardinal-N1. To prepare fusions at the N-terminus of mCardinal, the following digests were performed: human non-muscle \u03b1-actinin (GenBank accession number NM_001130005.1, source: Tom Keller, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, U.S.A.), EcoRI and NotI; human calnexin (NM_001746. \nFluorescence MicroscopyHeLa cells (CCL-2 and S-3, ATCC) were grown in a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) with 15% calf serum (HyClone). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTo prepare C-terminal fusions to mCardinal, the following digests were performed: human \u03b2-actin (NM_001101.3, Clontech), NheI and BglII; human \u03b1-tubulin (NM_006082, Clontech), NheI and BglII; human Rab4a (NM_004578.2, Viki Allen, University of Manchester, U.K.), BspEI and BamHI; human lamin B1 (NM_005573.2, George Patterson, NIH), EcoRI and BamHI; human myotilin (NM_006790.1, Origene), AgeI and BspEI; human fibrillarin (NM_001436.3, Evrogen), BglII and BamHI; human tight junction protein ZO1 (NM_003257.1, Origene), AgeI and BspEI; human VE cadherin (NM_001795.3, Origene), BglII and EcoRI; and the 20-amino-acid farnesylation signal from c-Ha-Ras (NM_001130442.1, Clontech), AgeI and BspEI.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs a traditional autocatalytic fluorescent protein, mCardinal may provide advantages over phytochrome-biliverdin fluorescent complexes in cells where biliverdin concentrations are low. In summary, with its unique combination of brightness, excitability with red light, and cofactor-independence, mCardinal should be useful in a wide variety of in vivo imaging applications.\nONLINE METHODS\nMutagenesis and screening of librariesMutations at specific residues were introduced by overlap-extension PCR. All PCR products were cut and ligated into a constitutive bacterial expression vector pNCS (Allele Biotech) or arabinose-inducible pBAD (Invitrogen). For all library construction methods, chemically competent Escherichia coli strain DH5\u03b1 (BioExpress) or XL-10 Gold (Invitrogen) were transformed and grown overnight on LB/agar at 37\u00b0C and maintained thereafter at room temperature. For each round of mutagenesis, a number of colonies approximately 10-fold higher than the expected library diversity were screened to ensure full coverage.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Ni\u00f1o years record larger than average atmospheric CO2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric CO2 and climate change. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTerrestrial models also investigated the effect of CO 2 and climate, always agreeing on the positive response of land carbon storage to atmospheric CO 2 increase (the so-called fertilization effect), but not reaching consensus on the terrestrial ecosystem response to the associated climate change. Some earlier studies found an enhanced terrestrial productivity [31] while later studies found the opposite [32,33]. The third assessment report of IPCC concluded that, by mid-twenty-first century, climate change would reduce the land carbon uptake by 21% to 43% and the ocean carbon uptake by 6% to 25%, relative to CO 2 only driven uptakes [34]. This IPCC range was very conservative, as further discussed below.Nevertheless, all these studies gave a clear signal to the climate modelling community: one cannot simulate future climate change assuming atmospheric CO 2 can be known, a priori, from the CO 2 emissions trajectory. The evolution of atmospheric CO 2 results from the balance between the CO 2 emissions and the land and ocean carbon sinks, these last ones being a complex function of atmospheric CO 2 and climate.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSecond, nitrogen also reduces the carbon loss due to climate change; as soil warming leads to increased nitrogen mineralization, hence increasing nitrogen availability to the plant [41,42].The Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group I of the IPCC AR5 headlined that 'Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO 2 in the atmosphere (high confidence)'. More specifically, it stated 'Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that the feedback between climate and the carbon cycle is positive in the 21st century; that is, climate change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO 2 . As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO 2 will remain in the atmosphere. A positive feedback between climate and the carbon cycle on century to millennial timescales is supported by palaeoclimate observations and modelling.'\nObservational constraintsClearly, models alone are not helping to constrain the carbon cycle feedbacks; observations are needed to reduce uncertainties. However, there is a fundamental issue when trying to constrain feedbacks from observations.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition, the induced carbon sink does not only depends on the rate of increase of photosynthesis, it also depends on the residence time of carbon in biomass and soils, delaying the increase in heterotrophic decomposition. Surprisingly, CMIP5 ESMs showed a very wide range of residence time and hence global vegetation and soil carbon estimates [61,62]. For example, simulated global soil carbon ranged between about 500 and 3000 GtC while the observation-based estimate is around 1300 GtC. This is clearly an area where models improvement and evaluation is essential and does not seem out of reach.On a related topic, nitrogen control on terrestrial plant productivity and hence on carbon sink was not represented in any of the earlier C 4 MIP models. For CMIP5, it was introduced in only one land surface model, CLM, which was common to two CMIP5 ESMs (CESM and NorESM). These two models simulated a much lower CO 2 -carbon cycle sensitivity (\u03b2) and a much lower climate-carbon cycle sensitivity (\u03b3 ) than the carbon-only ESMs.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show that the singularity corrections for treating these divergencies depend only on the total number and the positions of k points and on the lattice vectors, in particular, the unit cell volume, but not on the particular positions of atoms within the unit cell. The method proposed here to treat the singularities constitutes a stable, simple to implement, and general scheme that can be applied to systems with arbitrary lattice parameters within either the EXX Kohn-Sham or the HF formalism. We apply the singularity correction to a typical symmetric structure, diamond, and to a more general structure, trans-polyacetylene. We consider the effect of the singularity corrections on volume optimizations and k-point convergence. While the singularity correction clearly depends on the total number of k points, it exhibits a remarkably small dependence upon the choice of the specific arrangement of the k points. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nASorouri\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWM CFoulkes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tND MHine\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

RESULTS FOR DIAMOND AND TRANS -POLYACETYLENEThe applicability of the presented approach for treating the divergencies is now demonstrated by applying it to two cases, diamond and trans-polyacetylene, using different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals: the Slater-Dirac (exchange-only LDA) referred to as Dirac exchange in the following, the complete exchange-correlation LDA in the parametrisation of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN), 8 the combination of Dirac exchange plus Perdew86 9 (P86) correlation (P86 being VWN correlation plus a gradient correction), the EXX (exact-exchange only), and finally the combination of EXX with P86 correlation.The pseudopotentials were generated using the pseudopotential generation code of Engel, 26 which is based on the Troullier-Martins norm-conserving scheme. 27 In all cases the pseudopotentials were generated using consistently the same functionals for exchange and correlation as for the plane wave calculations. Relativistic effect are not included. The pseudopotentials of C are all constructed using a cutoff radius of 1.3 a.u.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The resulting fusion gene products have attracted considerable interest as diagnostic and promising therapeutic targets. So far, oncogenic FET fusion proteins have been regarded as strong transcription factors that aberrantly activate or repress target genes of their DNA-binding fusion partners. However, the role of the transactivating domain in the context of the normal FET proteins is poorly defined, and, therefore, our knowledge on how FET aberrations impact on tumor biology is incomplete. Since we believe that a full understanding of aberrant FET protein function can only arise from looking at both sides of the coin, the good and the evil, this paper summarizes evidence for the central function of FET proteins in bridging RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFUS has been demonstrated to bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs [15]. EWS might have similar sequence specificity since it was demonstrated to bind strongly to both poly G and poly U, but not to poly A and poly C RNA, homopolymers [16]. Although it is only the zinc finger domain of FUS that makes physical contact with the GGUG motif, all three RGG boxes together with the RRM contribute to this activity [15]. Intriguingly, a recent study identified strong binding of FUS to human telomeric RNA [17] and to small low-copy-number RNAs tethered to the promoter of cyclin D1 [18]. Nothing is known about the RNA binding specificity TAF15.\nA Role for FETProteins in RNA Transcription. The FET N-terminal domain (NTD) resembles the activation domain of certain transcription factors such as SP-1 rich in glutamine and proline residues. When fused to a DNA-binding domain (DBD), as is the case in oncogenic FET derivatives, the NTD strongly activates reporter gene activity in a DNA-bindingdependent way [19][20][21][22][23].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nsignal transduction\nMr. Hyde\nThe Role of FUS in NeurodegenerativeDisease. Point mutations of FUS have recently been found in a subset of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder destroying motoneurons [79,80]. Previously, this disease has been associated with mutations in either superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) or TDP43 (43 kDa TAR DNA-binding domain protein). TDP43 is an essential nuclear RNA-binding protein that participates in transcriptional repression, exon splicing inhibition, and mRNA stabilization. The convergent phenotypes associated with FUS and TDP43 mutations suggest that they are part of the same machinery. In fact, TDP-43 and FUS were demonstrated to function in a biochemical complex to modulate expression of HDAC6, a recently identified mRNA substrate of TDP-43 [81].\nThe Oncogenic Function of FET Fusion Protein.The predominant type of FET gene aberrations is that of fusions to various transcription factor genes by which the FET RNAbinding domain is replaced by the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor (Table 2).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nJekyll and Mr. Hyde: The Two Faces of the FUS/EWS/TAF15 Protein Family\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t801B9BC83DB6F3FB77EDF1DB175B1CC8\n\t\t\t\t\t10.1155/2011/837474\n\t\t\t\t\tReceived 2 September 2010; Revised 20 October 2010; Accepted 1 November 2010\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFUS, EWS, and TAF15 form the FET family of RNA-binding proteins whose genes are found rearranged with various transcription factor genes predominantly in sarcomas and in rare hematopoietic and epithelial cancers.

Comparison with earlier work on noncrystalline solids shows that they all have the same conductivity within a factor of 5 over the entire temperature range investigated, with the same characteristic plateau around 10 \u00b0K, and that their conductivity varies as Tn, n\u223c1.8, below T = 1 \u00b0K. Furthermore, the average phonon mean free path is large by comparison with the phonon wavelength, about 10\u22124 cm at 2 \u00b0K and decreasing as T\u22124 at larger T, suggesting a Rayleigh-type scattering mechanism. Such a mean free path can be quantitatively explained by approximating the glassy structure with that of a crystal in which every atom is displaced from its lattice site. Then every atom scatters like an interstitial atom, or\u2014even simpler\u2014like one that is missing at its regular lattice site, with a scattering cross section determined by the missing mass (isotopic defect). The specific heat of amorphous SiO2, GeO2, and Se has been found to vary as AT+BT3 between 0.1 and 1 \u00b0K, with A = 10 erg/g\u00b0K2 within a factor of 2. This departure from the Debye specific heat may be characteristic of the glassy state, as all earlier measurements of other glasses [polystyrene, glycerol, Lucite (PMMA)] indicate a similar anomaly. Its origin is not clear. Impurities or surface effects through adsorbed gases are unlikely because of the many samples and experimental techniques used in different laboratories. We have tried to attribute the anomaly to low-lying electronic states, motional states of ions, trapped atoms or large groups of atoms, or one-dimensional vibrations within a three-dimensional solid, so far without success. At the present time, the only independent evidence for these excitations appears to be in the low-temperature thermal conductivity at T < 1 \u00b0K described above. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nE.

INTRODUCTIONThe thermal conductivity of noncrystalline dielectric solids differs markedly from that of crystalline ones. ' As an example, Fig. 1 shows the conductivities of crystalline and vitreous silicon dioxide. In crystals, the conductivity increases with decreasing temperature because the anhar- monic umklapp processes become less frequent, and hence the phonon mean free path increases. Eventually, the mean free path becomes comparable to the sample dimensions, and the conductivity goes through a maximum and then decreases as the specific heat decreases.The conductivity of crystals depends very much on the material, and in ad- dition any disturbance of the lattice periodicity lowers the conductivity in a sometimes very characteristic way, as shown in Fig. 1, for example.In noncrystalline solids, the conductivity is several orders of magnitude smaller than in crystals, it decreases monotonically with decreasing tempera- ture, and furthermore it is independent of the chem- ical composition: In Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n11 and 12). A summary of the chemical composition of glasses can be found in Ref. 6.phonon mean free path / is defined by where E is the thermal conductivity, C\" the specific heat of the plane lattice waves, and v the Debye sound velocity, /at1 'K is found tobe of order 10 lcm in glasses, i. e. , 100times the wavelength of the domi- identical. Even noncrystalline solids with completely different chemical compositions, such as s 14-1v varnishes 18 Se 12 and Geoa 19 all have very similar conductivities (Fig. 3).The only exceytions appear to be glass ceramics ' such Rs Pyroceram, Rnd tile partially cl'ys- tallizing yolymers, such as nylon and Tef lone'4'~'33 and polyethylene. ' Their conductivities are consid- erably smaller below 1 'K than those of the noncrys- talline solids, they depend on the sample, and they usually vary more rayidly with temperature.The dependence of the conductivity on the crystallinity of polyethylene has been studied by Salinger.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1. In Fig. 8 we compare the con- ductivities of several vitreous materials. As we pointed out in the introduction, all noncrystalline materials have practically identical conductivities. This is confirmed by our measurements.Our data, which extend to lower temperatures, show that the conductivities vary as T\" with n-1. 8, below 1'K.The mean free paths, determined for quartz, vi- treous silica, germania, ' and selenium with the help of Eq.

The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis eventually will lead to wrong results in the bulk and we strongly recommend all other DFs \u0351in particular, BLYP, revPBE, and B97-D at the semi-local level\u0352 together with DFT-D3 for water-related problems.The most striking conclusion from the analysis of the statistical benchmark data is the enhanced accuracy of the new version for the very important and difficult tripeptide folding test set \u0351PCONF, see Refs. 98, 112, and 113\u0352 with all DFs. In Fig. 9 we compare ten conformational energies with the old and new methods for selected DFs and note in passing that deviations for most uncorrected functionals are so large \u0351MAD=2-5 kcal/ mol\u0352 that the curves would not fit within the chosen energy scale. As pointed out previously, 58 theoretical peptide folding without dispersion corrections makes absolutely no sense! Generally, the MAD values for DFT-D3 are about a factor of 1/2 lower compared to DFT-D2 \u0351see also Fig. 7\u0352 which can be considered as a big step toward an accurate modeling of such folding processes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n98. If one considers the large average binding energy of 82.0 kcal/mol, the DFT-D3 results can be regarded as mostly very accurate and an MAD value of about 2 kcal/mol for PW6B95 is close to the accuracy of the reference values \u0351and to remaining basis set incompleteness effects\u0352. For all 11 DFs the average MAD decreases from 7.8 \u0351DFT\u0352 to 5.2 \u0351DFT-D2\u0352 and 4.3 kcal/mol for DFT-D3. Only for PBE and PBE0 which have a clear overbinding tendency already without any correction, \u0351both\u0352 versions worsen the results. Note, however, that these two DFs without correction do not give the right answer for the right reason: they simulate the effects of dispersion \u0351that become more important as the size of the system increases\u0352 by overbinding of each hydrogen bond.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFurthermore, it has been designed from the very beginning as a correction for common functionals \u0351such as B3LYP, PBE, or TPSS\u0352 that may be not optimal for noncovalent interactions \u0351for an interesting new idea in this context, see Ref. 28\u0352 but perform well for other important properties.

All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAll of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust 3,4 .

Our increasing population size and per capita impacts are severely testing the ability of Earth to provide for peoples' most basic needs. Awareness of these circumstances has grown tremendously, as has the sophistication of efforts to address them. But the complexity of the challenge remains daunting. We explore prospects for transformative change in three critical areas of sustainable development: achieving a sustainable population size and securing vital natural capital, both in part through reducing inequity, and strengthening the societal leadership of academia. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA great diversity of efforts to implement the ecosystem services framework has emerged worldwide (Box 1). Collectively, they represent a promising shift towards a more inclusive, integrated and effective set of strategies [64][65][66] . Taken together, these efforts span the globe and target a full suite of ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water supply, flood control, coastal protection and enhancement of scenic beauty (and associated recreation/ tourism values) 67,68 .The ecosystem service investments being made in China today stand out in their ambitious goals, scale and duration. Prompted by massive droughts and flooding in 1997-1998, China implemented several national forestry and conservation initiatives to address the nation's growing environmental crises, involving approximately 120 million households and investing approximately 700 billion yuan over 2000-2010 69 . China is currently also undertaking a first national assessment of ecosystem services, spanning a wide range of ecosystems, services and scales. Perhaps most ambitiously, China is establishing a new network of 'ecosystem function conservation areas' (EFCAs; Fig. 3).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nneeds, goals and desired futures, for example see ref.97. The embedding of environmental concerns into public discourse and policy less than a quarter of a century after 1960 is in itself a fine example of the speed with which cultural change towards sustainability can occur. Now we need to see if we can go much further, in far less time.\nFigure 3 |3Figure 3 | China's new system of EFCAs. As delineated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007, EFCAs span 24% of China's land area and 25% (708) of its counties. EFCAs are designed to secure biodiversity, soils and water resources, and to mitigate floods and prevent sandstorms. The implementation of EFCAs also serves a major social goal of alleviating poverty. Figure is a modified version of a map provided courtesy of Z. Ouyang, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\t\t\tMacmillan Publishers Limited.

EFCAs are being zoned so as to focus conservation and restoration in places with high return on investment for public benefit; at the same time, high-impact human activities are being zoned to sustain or enhance natural capital values.These initiatives have dual goals: to harmonize people and nature by securing critical natural capital, and to alleviate poverty. Specifically, the government aims to protect ecosystems and their biodiversity for flood control, hydropower production efficiency, irrigation supply, more productive agriculture and tourism. In addition, it aims to open non-farm sectors, increase household income and make land-use practices more sustainable in rural areas 70 . Although these initiatives represent a massive scientific and policy undertaking, there is still little understanding of the local costs of implementation, or their effects on poor and vulnerable populations in or near the target areas. The EFCA model represents a new paradigm for integrating conservation and human development, but for this policy innovation to have wide applicability, it will be important to assess and improve local livelihoods 71 .\nGender and gender equity in sustainabilityAs evidence for the value of community-based resource management has accumulated 72 , a special role for women in environmental sustainability has begun to emerge.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Obstacles blocking wider adoption of FIB-SEM include slow imaging speed and lack of long-term system stability, which caps the maximum possible acquisition volume. Here, we present techniques that accelerate image acquisition while greatly improving FIB-SEM reliability, allowing the system to operate for months and generating continuously imaged volumes > 106 \u00b5m3. These volumes are large enough for connectomics, where the excellent z resolution can help in tracing of small neuronal processes and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming human proofreading effort. Even higher resolution can be achieved on smaller volumes. We present example data sets from mammalian neural tissue, Drosophila brain, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to illustrate the power of this novel high-resolution technique to address questions in both connectomics and cell biology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe probe current was set at ~4 nA and working distance at ~3 mm with imaging speed of 4 MHz. The x-y pixel size was 8 nm for both systems unless noted. SEM images were acquired for every 2 nm of material removal. After the final image series were registered using IMOD (Kremer et al., 1996) or SIFT plug-in of Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012), every four consecutive images were binned down to one, forming an image stack with isotropic voxels of 8 \u00c2 8 \u00c2 8 nm 3 . The gallium FIB column was operated at 30 keV. A 7-nA probe current was selected for milling with the FEI Magnum column, while a 13-or 27-nA probe current was used in a Zeiss NVision40. A repeated line scan of 0.1 mm pixel and 1-MHz frequency was applied. A 10 Hz PID closed-loop algorithm written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controlled the line scan position relative to the specimen block-face.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBased on the automated segmentation and human proofreading speed and error rate, we determined that a voxel sampling of 8 nm was optimal for our Drosophila connectomics studies. This is at least 50% smaller then Nyquist sampling distance for beam blur associated with currents of up to 4 nA characterized by the edge signal intensity drop-off of gold nanoparticles on a carbon surface (Electron Microscopy Sciences, P.O. Box 550, 1560 Industry Road, Hatfield, PA 19440, USA, Part #79511-01). Dwell times of 0.8 to 3 ms with 12,000 to 48,000 primary beam electrons per pixel gave a useable SNR of 5 or better.\nHigher resolution imaging conditions and constraintsContinuous long-term operation opens up opportunities for studies that require higher resolution. For low-voltage (~1 keV) SEM's operating with 0.1-10.0 nA on the primary beam, the resolution is a function of current (Reimer, 1993). Spherical and chromatic aberration are prime contributors to beam blur, so smaller numerical apertures with smaller beam currents typically improve resolution.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe trimming is usually guided by optical inspection under a microtome and X-ray tomography data obtained by a Zeiss Versa XRM-510. The limited block-face size ensures a complete removal of the block-face material, rather than forming a trench in the sample. This arrangement improves milling stability by eliminating sidewall effect and back sputtering.

The probe current was set at ~3 nA and working distance at ~4.5 mm with imaging speed of 1.25 MHz. Images acquired on a Zeiss Merlin system (hybrid with 90 degree mounted FEI Magnum FIB) used slightly different conditions: landing energy was 1.2 keV with 0.6 keV electron beam energy with a sample bias of 0.6 kV.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A triple point was found in each compound below 100 MPa. By pressurization, the low pressure phases disappeared at the triple point in the chloride and bromide while a new high-pressure phase appeared in the iodide. The pressures and temperatures of the triple points are 75.1 MPa, 175.7 K for CH3NH3PbCl3, 43.2 MPa, 152.9 K for CH3NH3PbBr3, and 84.8 MPa, 176.2 K for CH3NH3PbI3. All the boundaries between the cubic and tetragonal phases are upward convex and that of the iodide has a maximum at about 120 MPa. Other phase boundaries are essentially straight lines in the measured pressure and temperature ranges. By the use of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the transition volumes were calculated from the slopes of the phase boundaries and the transition entropies obtained in a previously published calorimetric experiment (J. Phys. Chem. Solids51, 1383 (1990)). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, the triple points were found in all of the three MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals below 100 MPa.The experimental DTA curves of MAPbBr, and MAPbI, in the high temperature region are shown in Figs 4 and5, respectively. The heating rates were 0.7-1.0 and 0.7-0.8 K min-' for MAPbBr, and MAPbI,, respectively. An endothermic peak due to the I4/mcm -Pm3m transition was observed in both samples. As indicated by the scales (and by the increased noise level in the base line of the curves) in Figs 4 and5, the peak heights of these transitions are much smaller than those of the other transitions shown before. This is because the I4/mcm -Pm3m transitions of both crystals are of a gradual type and the first-order component of the transition entropy is only 46% of the total [5]. The peak temperature decreased monotonically and the peak shape became broader with increasing pressure for MAPbBr,.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn a recent paper [5], we reported calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I), where MA represents the methylammonium ion, CH,NH: . All the phase transitions were of the first order. The large transition entropies indicated that the phase transitions are of the order-disorder type. The entropy values were interpreted with structural models in which each MA ion is disordered with respect to the orientations of the C-N axis itself and around the C-N axis.In the present paper, we investigate the pressure dependence of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) by using a high pressure DTA. Our purpose is to determine the p-T phase diagrams of the three halides and thereby to obtain \nEXPERIMENTALThe sample preparation of MAPbX, is the same as described in the previous paper [5]. The DTA experiments were performed with a home-made apparatus described elsewhere [8]. It was essentially a metal block made of copper-beryllium alloy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor MAPbI,, however, the transition line had a maximum around 110 MPa, below which the slope dT,,/dp was positive and above which negative. The peak shape and area did not change significantly in the whole pressure range. Table 2 summarizes the transition temperature T,, its pressure dependence dT,/dp, the transition entropy AuaS, and the transition volume AtR V. Here, AtnS is the value determined from calorimetry at atmospheric pressure [5]   All the values of the transition volume are quite small; less than 2% of the molar volume of MAPbX, (Cl: 110cm3 mol-I, Br: 124cm3 mol-', I: 153 cm3 mol-I).

In most cases when noninvasive imaging is not used, studies assume a consistent baseline condition in rats that lack visible differences. While performing a series of traumatic brain injury studies, we discovered mild spontaneous ventriculomegaly in 70 (43.2%) of 162 Wistar rats that had been obtained from 2 different vendors. Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, including MR angiography and diffusion tensor imaging, were used to evaluate the rats. Multiple neuropathologic abnormalities, including presumed arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, cysts, white matter lesions, and astrogliosis were found in association with ventriculomegaly. Postmortem microcomputed tomography and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Diffusion tensor imaging showed significant decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in multiple white matter tracts (p < 0.05). These results could impact the interpretation, for example, of a pseudo-increase of axon integrity and a pseudo-decrease of myelin integrity, based on characteristics intrinsic to rats with ventriculomegaly. We suggest the use of baseline imaging to prevent the inadvertent introduction of a high degree of variability in preclinical studies of neurologic disease or injury in Wistar rats. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAnatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition. Each animal's baseline brain MRI studies were reviewed independently by 3 investigators assessing the scans for any ventricular dilatation, asymmetrical ventricles, aqueduct stenosis, arachnoid cysts, cyst-like lesions, hyperintense lesions and otherwise unidentified bright objects. Animals without brain anomalies on baseline MRI were considered normal. The volume of ventricles or the hyperintense CSF compartments were quantified using National Institutes of Health ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) software and normalized to the volume of brain section at the same slices for cross comparison over each animal. A CSF compartment rating scale was applied to evaluate the ventricular and cystic abnormalities.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPostmortem micro-CT and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were also performed to verify the imaging findings and inspect the spontaneous anomalies in the CNS of the ventriculomegaly Wistar rats. The presence of these spontaneous ventriculomegaly patterns may be associated with abnormal vasculature, including aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Baseline scans are critical to exclude animals with ventriculomegaly and AVM anomalies to ensure consistent and reliable animal models of CNS diseases.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimal and Ventriculomegaly Rating ScaleEight-week-old Wistar rats purchased from Charles River (n = 134, female) and Harlan Laboratories (n = 28, including 22 female and 6 male) were examined. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at our institution. Anatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe inhalant anesthetic was delivered to the animal through a custom-made nose cone. Throughout MR scans, warm water was circulated under the animals to keep them warm at 37\u00b0C; a steady respiratory rate was monitored using a pressure sensor (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY), and maintained at 40 to 50 breaths/minute by isoflurane/oxygen mixture. For the baseline scan, high-resolution RARE MRI was first performed on every rat to acquire the anatomical T 2 -weighted images (TR 3.8 s, TE 15 ms, RARE factor 8, field of view [FOV] 2.56 \u00d7 2.56 [cm], matrix 256 \u00d7 256, in-plane resolution 100 \u00d7 100 [\u03bcm] with 0.5-mm thickness, number of excitation [NEX] 4, scan time 8 minutes).

The solvents used were \u03b3\u2010butyrolactone (BL), propylene carbonate (PC), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the salts included and . Cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes was correlated to their surface chemistry and morphology in the various solvent systems. The effects of both water and oxygen contamination were rigorously studied. It was found that the presence of oxygen in solutions considerably increased the cycling efficiency of the lithium electrode. This effect correlates well with the influence of the presence of oxygen on the surface morphology of lithium electrodes in solutions. The presence of water increases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in PC, and decreases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in ethers. These results are discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in the various solvent systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1.\n|Fig. 1.

Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements. After cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc [1] where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively. The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +.Typical measurements of working electrode potential changes during cycling efficiency experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2. A periodic galvanostatic operation of the cell described in Fig. 1 was carried out by triggering the PAR (Model 173) potentiostat (set to galvanostatie mode) by a square waveform generator built specially for these experiments.,Spectroscopic measurements.--The FTIR measurements of Li electrodes are described in detail elsewhere (11)(12)(13).

A lithium-sulfur cell with a nanostructured anode is created with a high Coulombic efficiency and high capacity retention rate of 36.3% after 2000 cycles. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 25 ] However, a large quantity of micro-sized Li dendrites is observed in case of plate Li metal anode while the nanostructured metallic Li anode is dendritefree when applying a huge current density of 10 mA cm -2 based on the surface of fl at electrode (Figure 3 e,f). For plate Li metal electrode, the huge uptake of current results in strong local electrical fi eld and extremely high concentration gradient of Li ions as driven force for high throughput transportation of electrons from electrode and ions from electrolyte, which is benefi cial for the dendrite growth. While for the nanostructured metallic Li anode, its 3D nanostructure with abundant electrode/electrolyte interfaces lower the absolute local current density even though applying the same current as Li anode. Thus both the gradients of electrical fi eld and Li ion concentration at local regions are reduced to orders of magnitude towards increased Sand's time and dendritefree morphology.

When the Li deposit size is beyond that of the matrix, Li + adsorption and deposition ability of the deposits will be below the matrix and then Li + deposits on the matrix rather than on the dendrites continually. Thus, the nanostructured LiB alloy anode not only reduces the current density, which decreases the growth velocity of Li deposits, but also limits the fi nal size of deposited Li on the nanostructured matrix, which leads to the dendrite-free morphology at macroscale (Figure 1 c). Consequently, the Li deposits on the nanostructured anode with metallic Li embeded in fi brous Li 7 B 6 matrix are always with smaller size than that on the plate Li metal anode.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this work, we demonstrate that a plasmonic resonance in top-down nanofabricated yttrium antennas can be completely and reversibly turned on and off using hydrogen exposure. We fabricate arrays of yttrium nanorods and optically observe, in extinction spectra, the hydrogen-induced phase transition between the metallic yttrium dihydride and the insulating trihydride. Whereas the yttrium dihydride nanostructures exhibit a pronounced particle plasmon resonance, the transition to yttrium trihydride leads to a complete vanishing of the resonant behavior. The plasmonic resonance in the dihydride state can be tuned over a wide wavelength range by simply varying the size of the nanostructures. Furthermore, we develop an analytical diffusion model to explain the temporal behavior of the hydrogen loading and unloading trajectories observed in our experiments and gain information about the thermodynamics of our device. Thus, our nanorod system serves as a versatile basic building block for active plasmonic devices ranging from switchable perfect absorbers to active local heating control elements. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n51 Furthermore, the system can be used as a hydrogen detector through monitoring the slope of YH 2 to YH 3 phase transition or to locally control chemical processes that require a certain activation energy. This energy can be provided by the enhanced local electric field generated by the plasmonic resonance, depending on the surrounding hydrogen concentration. Due to its high refractive index, YH 3 could even act as high-index nanophotonic material (n \u2248 2.8 at 600 nm 31,52 ) which supports electric and magnetic Mie resonances 53,54 that can be switched on and off using hydrogen. Other transition metals such as vanadium 55 or scandium, or transition metal alloys like Mg-Y, Mg-La, Mg-Sc, and Mg-Gd may provide even faster response. [56][57][58][59] Complete blackness and thus highest switching contrast could be expected using nickel metal hydrides (such as Mg 2 MeH x , with Me = Ni, Co, Fe).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe transition between metallic and dielectric yttrium hydride antennas is induced by simple hydrogen exposure from the gas phase or from electrolysis under ambient atmospheric conditions and shows a drastic change of the spectral response.Compared to other promising phase change materials used in plasmonic devices, yttrium dihydride has the advantage of comparatively low intrinsic damping and can therefore support plasmonic resonances itself, whereas the metallic phases of VO 2 , GST, or GLS are known to exhibit only a weak plasmonic response, if any. Despite the advantage of much faster switching times, they can often be used only in hybrid plasmonic systems, that is, in combination with gold or other good plasmonic metals. However, the use of hybrid systems drastically lowers the switching contrast, since only the dielectric environment of the resonant material changes and not the antenna itself. Therefore, yttrium dihydride is a highly relevant and very promising alternative for plasmonic applications that require a high switching contrast and are less dependent on ultrashort switching times.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhereas the yttrium dihydride nanostructures exhibit a pronounced particle plasmon resonance, the transition to yttrium trihydride leads to a complete vanishing of the resonant behavior.

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I(1-x)Br(x))3 (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of \u03b3-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer. The process involves five stages, as depicted in Fig. 1c. First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate. Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent. Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min (Fig. 1b). As is apparent from Supplementary Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 \u2022 C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 \u2022 C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The prepared MAI and MABr powders, PbI 2 (Aldrich) and PbBr 2 (Aldrich) for 0.8 M MAPb(I 1-x Br x ) 3 (x = 0.1-0.15) solution were stirred in a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 \u2022 C for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting. A detailed time-rotation profile for the spin-coating is represented in Supplementary Fig. 1c.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1b). As is apparent from Supplementary Fig. 1, the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 \u2022 C (Supplementary Fig. 1b).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n. . ' will open a reflectiondata file in any of the specified formats. Note that XtalView .phs files do not contain space-group and cell information: in these cases a PDB file must be read first to obtain the relevant information or the information has to be entered manually. MTZ files may contain many sets of map coefficients and so it is necessary to select which map coefficients to use. In this case the user is provided with an additional window which allows the map coefficients to be selected. The standard data names for some common crystallographic software are provided in Table 1. SHELX .fcf files are converted to mmCIF format and the space group is then inferred from the symmetry operators.\nModel buildingInitial building of protein structures from experimental phasing is usually accomplished by automated methods such as ARP/wARP, RESOLVE (Wang et al., 2004) and Buccaneer (Cowtan, 2006). However, most of these methods rely on a resolution of better than 2.5 A \u02daand yield more complete models the better the resolution.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBecause most DNA and RNA structures are comprised of at least local regions of regular near-ideal helical structural elements, the ability to generate nucleic acid helical models on the fly is of particular value for molecular replacement.Recently, a collection of short ideal A-form RNA helical fragments generated within Coot were used to solve a structurally complex ligase ribozyme by molecular replacement (Robertson & Scott, 2008). Using Coot together with the powerful molecular-replacement program Phaser (Storoni et al., 2004) not only permitted this novel RNA structure to be solved without resort to heavy-atom methods, but several other RNA and RNA/protein complexes were also subsequently determined using this approach (Robertson & Scott, 2007). Since Coot and Phaser can be scripted using embedded Python components, an automated and integrated phasing system is amenable for development within the current software framework.4.1.7.

By combining two short perpendicularly polarized pulses with frequencies centered at \u03c91 and \u03c92, where (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92)/\u03c91 \u226a 1, we can create a pulse with polarization that sweeps from circular through linear back to circular. It is possible to make the duration of the segment of the pulse capable of emitting short-wavelength radiation so small that emission is possible only for a time less than the period of the fundamental. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n9 The bandwidth of the two components can easily be broad enough to permit the synthesized pulse to fall sufficiently in intensity before the linear polarization condition can reappear, thus ensuring that harmonic emission is very weak at all times except near t = 0. Measurement of the time duration of subfemtosecond pulses also seems feasible. Since it is as complex as the production process it will be addressed elsewhere.' 3 Our approach to attosecond pulse generation is a special case of a much more general phenomenon, namely, coherent control of strong-field atomic processes. Here we have described how control over the trajectory of a continuum electron can modulate the high-order susceptibility in time. The same physics can be applied to the control of the atomic susceptibility in space. In fact, a relatively weak (control) beam of circularly polarized light propagating along the direction of the electric-field vector of the fundamental light will deflect an electron so that it misses the ion. Therefore the control beam can ensure that any atom illuminated by the control beam will be unable to emit harmonic radiation, thus permitting quasi-phase matching. We foresee its application to harmonic generation using ions.Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBy combining two short perpendicularly polarized pulses with frequencies centered at aol and to 2 , where ((ol -wJ 2 )/wI << 1, we can create a pulse with polarization that sweeps from circular through linear back to circular. It is possible to make the duration of the segment of the pulse capable of emitting short-wavelength radiation so small that emission is possible only for a time less than the period of the fundamental.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nSince the development of the laser, obtaining shorter and shorter pulses has been a major emphasis of laser science. To approach the limit of 10 fs, at which short-pulse lasers currently operate,\" 2 nonresonant (Kerr) nonlinearities are used. However, the development of short-pulse coherent sources of less than 1-fs duration will require shorter-wavelength radiation and a new nonlinearity. In this Letter we introduce a method for producing pulses with durations approaching 1 atomic unit of time based on highharmonic emission from atomic gases.High harmonics have been extensively studied.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(3)  Those electrons that return to the vicinity of the ion emit harmonic radiation in a coherent interaction between the portion of the wave function remaining in the ground state and the returning portion (coherent spontaneous recombination to the ground state). In what follows we use the semiclassical version of this model 5 to describe the approach to producing attosecond pulses. The more comprehensive quantum treatments of the induced dipole moment gives substantially the same results, but, although it is more rigorous, the quantum treatment loses some of the transparency of the semiclassical description.Both the semiclassical and the quantum analyses indicate that, if viewed through a filter that passes only the highest harmonics, a sequence of short pulses [Fig. 1(a)], would be seen, much like the output of a mode-locked laser. We performed this calculation, assuming a 25-fs pulse of 800-nm light interacting with neon with a peak laser intensity of 6 X 1014 W/cm 2 . The filter had the transmission characteristics of 200-nm-thick silver film. 7 The filter ensures that frequencies below 100 eV are filtered out.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage size of 3.8 nm and the highest pore volume of 2.8 cm(3) g(-1) among reported Zr-MOFs. Moreover, PCN-777 shows excellent stability in aqueous environments, which makes it an ideal candidate as a support to incorporate different functional moieties. Through facile internal surface modification, the interaction between PCN-777 and different guests can be varied to realize efficient immobilization. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[1,2]  Due to their readily adjustable structures and tunable functionalities inside the frameworks, mesoporous MOFs facilitate the performance of those materials through heterogenization or isolation. However, the majority of reported MOFs are microporous. Difficulty in organic linker extension, variation of synthetic conditions in isoreticular structures, framework interpenetration and challenges in activation all hamper the development of novel mesoporous MOFs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nmechanical and the chemical stability of the framework decrease gradually. [3] Furthermore, the working environments of those immobilized moieties are usually harsh, which requires the frameworks to be chemically very stable. The requirement of a combination of good chemical stability and large pores means that very few candidates are widely utilized. MIL-101 and MIL-100 are two extraordinary examples that exhibit both properties and are suitable supports. [4] MIL-100 and MIL-101, both of which have zeotype mtn topology (zeotype refers to structures sharing the same topology with zeolites), contain super-tetrahedral cages to substitute for the tetrahedral unit in zeolites.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[5] Hence, their largest pores reach 31\u00c5 and 29\u00c5 respectively although the organic linkers are relatively small. Moreover, the metal nodes in these MOFs are based on trivalent metal species. The strong interaction between carboxylates and high valent metal species accompanied with the small organic linker endows these frameworks with excellent chemical stability.Despite these advantages, the pore size still restricts further application of these MOFs when it comes to larger guests such as nanoparticles or enzymes. Therefore, synthesis of mesoporous materials with larger pore size which also maintain excellent chemical stability is highly desired. Application of a ligand larger than those in the MIL-100 and MIL-101 MOFs to create zeotype frameworks would be an effective way to generate extra-large pores, while avoiding complicated organic synthesis to make the linker extremely large.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUnfortunately, there are several challenges in the way of extending these mtn topological MOFs: First, the M 3 O(COO) 6 (M= Fe(III), Al(III), Cr(III), In(III), V(III), Sc(III)) building block is not the thermodynamically favored form, which makes the controllable formation of target products difficult; [6] second, even if the inorganic building block can be obtained, competitive framework isomers, such as the MIL-88 structure, still dominate as the major products; moreover, most of the synthesis needs to be conducted under hydrothermal conditions, which is infeasible for large organic linkers with poor water solubility. Therefore, searching for other zeotype frameworks, which can be synthetically controlled more easily, is one promising strategy.Through a topological analysis, we herein present a zeotype mesoporous Zr-MOF, namely PCN-777, which has the \u03b2-cristobalite type structure. PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage (3.8nm) and the highest porosity (2.8cm 3 /g) among all the reported Zr-MOFs.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

By using \u03b1-Fe2O3/Ppy as the anode materials with iron foil as the current collector, the unique structure affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/diintercalation for Li-ion battery. A relatively high specific capacity of 0.42 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at 0.1 mA/cm2 even after 100 charge/discharge cycles, with a plateau potential of 1 V and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, suggesting the feasibility to use this unique 3D nanostructured hybrid composite for microbattery in both small and large scale applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe appearance of the strong peak at 1590 cm \u00c01 , weak peaks at 982 cm \u00c01 and 930 cm \u00c01 , which are assigned to C =C backbone stretching and ring-in plane deformation of PPY, respectively, indicating the successful polymerization of polypyrrole [16].

Here, we design a novel catalyst by combining Pd NPs with Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocrystals for Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling of aryl chlorides. This nanocatalyst demonstrated good activity (yield 86.2% at 80 \u00b0C), high TOF, great stability, easy separation, excellent reusability (initial rates were not reduced after five cycles) and low cost in Suzuki reactions. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSecondly, Pd 2+ ions replaced Co 2+ and became Pd 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 due to the lower k sp of Pd 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 .

Herein, a highly active and stable electrocatalyst of MoC encapsulated by graphitized carbon shells (nanoMoC@GS) has been developed via an in situ carburization of a Mo-based metal\u2013organic framework (Mo-MOF) with the atomic periodic structure. The ultrafine MoC nanoparticles (\u223c3 nm) confined by 1\u20133 layered graphite shells significantly favor the efficient HER in both acidic and basic media. In particular, a low overpotential (\u03b710 = 124 and 77 mV at a current density of \u221210 mA cm\u22122), a small Tafel slope (43 and 50 mV dec\u22121) and a high exchange current density (j0 = 0.015 and 0.212 mA cm\u22122) are achieved on nanoMoC@GS in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Such remarkable activity, outperforming most current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, stems from the cooperative/synergistic effects of ultrafine MoC nanostructure, ultrathin and conductive graphitized carbon shells, and enriched porosity. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high-performance electrocatalysts via converting \u201catomic contact\u201d hybrid structures (e.g., MOFs), illustrating a new perspective for developing nanocatalysts in the energy chemistry field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFig. 22Fig. 2 SEM (a), TEM (b, c) and HRTEM (d) images of nanoMoC@GS(700).\nFig. 33Fig. 3 STEM image (a), elemental mappings (b, c) and EDS spectrum (d) of nanoMoC@GS(700).\nFig. 44Fig. 4 N 2 -sorption isotherms of nanoMoC@GS(T) (a) and corresponding pore size distribution curves (b) calculated from desorption branches.\nFig. 66Fig. 6 (a) EIS for the three samples.

(b) Nyquist and Bode plots showing EIS responses of nanoMoC@GS(700) sample at various HER overpotentials in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs shown in Fig. 6a, nano-MoC@GS(700) presented a much lower charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) value (14.5 U) than nanoMoC@GS(800) (28.6 U) and nanoMoC@GS(900) (69.5 U), indicating a faster electron transfer rate in the HER process. This lower R ct should be related to the con\ue103ned geometry in nanoMoC@GS materials, which would enhance the close interface contract of MoC nanoparticles with the ultrathin graphitized carbon shell and allow rapid charge transfer kinetics during the electrochemical process by improving the conductivity of electrocatalysts. The lowest R ct value for nanoMoC@GS(700) might result from its relatively large quantity of graphitized carbon (Table S1 \u2020).

As expected, given its highest HER activity, nanoMoC@GS(700) did show the largest C dl value of 66.6 mF cm \u00c02 (Fig. 5c), implying that this sample had a much higher ECSA than the samples prepared at higher carburization temperatures. Meanwhile, the surface area (S BET ) of the samples followed the same decreasing order of the C dl value with the increase in carburization temperature, that is, nano-MoC@GS(700) (187 m 2 g \u00c01 ) > nanoMoC@GS(800) (131 m 2 g \u00c01 ) > nanoMoC@GS(900) (115 m 2 g \u00c01 ).

Inhibitors that target the EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinases show therapeutic effects against LADCs containing EGFR gene mutations and ALK gene fusions, respectively. Recently, we and others identified the RET fusion gene as a new targetable driver gene in LADC. The RET fusions occur in 1-2% of LADCs. Existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of RET tyrosine kinase show promising therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as in a few patients.

(5,6) In addition, 3-5% of LADC harbor fusions that result in the activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene; such mutations are mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations. Inhibitors, such as crizotinib, that target ALK tyrosine kinase show marked therapeutic effects against ALK fusion-positive LADCs.

This problem can be solved by adapting the ultrasoft (US) pseudopotentials proposed by Vanderbilt [24]. The new scheme is characterized by two main points.

However, despite its ability to control matter with near-atomic precision, the technique is overlooked in most histories of nanoscience and nanotechnology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nConsequently, structures built of alternating layers of AlAs and GaAs would figure prominently in early MBE studies.Alfred Y. Cho, an ambitious Chinese scientist who is sometimes called the 'father of MBE' , started working with John Arthur soon after he joined Bell Labs in 1968 (Fig. 1). Together they blended basic science with instrumental engineering as they improved their fabrication technique and studied the properties of the new materials they made. Cho had previously worked on ion-beam propulsion for space applications, which, he later explained, was the reason why his \"MBE systems all look like ion engines!\" 9 . At first, however, they could only produce a few hundred angstroms of GaAs per day, grown in layers that were too thin to accurately characterize.Over at IBM, meanwhile, Leo Esaki and Ray Tsu were grappling with a theoretical concept known as a superlattice. Whereas the heterostructures proposed by Kroemer contained just two layers of different materials, superlattices could be made of many very thin layers of two or more different semiconductors.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnd by cleverly mixing doped with updoped layers, they could tune the structure and composition of the material and vary its electrical properties. The design and fabrication of new semiconductor materials by MBE has been described by Federico Capasso, another former Bell Lab researcher, as \"bandgap engineering\".As the research community became big enough to support dedicated MBE conferences, commercial firms began to pay attention. By the early 1980s, firms like Riber offered the first off-the-shelf MBE systems, which helped make the technique even more accessible. After a decade of incremental improvements and refinements, a fully fledged instrumental community had coalesced around MBE and its ability to fabricate nanostructured materials. Today, there are hundreds of MBE machines in use at university and industry labs throughout the world, with a typical machine costing around a million dollars. Away from the research lab, scaled-up MBE machines produce semiconductor structures for lasers that are found in hundreds of millions of compact disk and DVD players.Like the STM, MBE has also been associated with Nobel glory.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs the theorist in a small semiconductor research group, he proposed \"a non-stoichiometric mixed crystal of different semiconductors with different energy gaps\" 6    \nBUILDING NEW NANOSTRUCTURESThroughout the 1960s, researchers grappled with the challenge of making new crystalline materials for semiconductor applications. A good deal of the most significant work was done at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, between 1968 and 1973. At Bell Labs, for example, John R. Arthur Jr published a paper in July 1968 that described construction of epitaxial gallium arsenide layers using molecular beams of these elements 8 , and he filed a patent application for his work in the same year. Managers at Bell and IBM viewed GaAs, with its wide bandgap and high electron mobility, as a good candidate for high-speed electro-optical devices, and researchers liked the fact that the lattice constant of GaAs closely matches that of aluminium arsenide, another III-V semiconductor.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The general synthesis strategy is based on a sol-gel process associated with nonionic block copolymer as templates in ethanol solvent. Small-angle XRD, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption results show that these mesoporous aluminas possess a highly ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure, which is resistant to high temperature up to 1000 degrees C. Ordered mesoporous structures with tunable pore sizes are obtained with various precursors, different acids as pH adjustors, and different block copolymers as templates. These mesoporous aluminas have large surface areas (ca. 400 m2/g), pore volumes (ca. 0.70 cm3/g), and narrow pore-size distributions. The influence of the complexation ability of anions and hydro-carboxylic acid, acid volatility, and other important synthesis conditions are discussed in detail. Utilizing this simple strategy, we also obtained partly ordered mesoporous alumina with hydrous aluminum nitrate as the precursor. FTIR pyridine adsorption measurements indicate that a large amount of Lewis acid sites exist in these mesoporous aluminas. These materials are expected to be good candidates in catalysis due to the uniform pore structures, large surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and large amounts of surface Lewis acid sites. Loaded with ruthenium, the representative mesoporous alumina exhibits reactant size selectivity in hydrogenation of acetone, D-glucose, and D-(+)-cellobiose as a test reaction, indicating the potential applications in shape-selective catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThen 1.4-1.6 mL of 67 wt % nitric acid (or 1.4-1.6 mL of 37 wt % hydrochloric acid plus 0.5 g citric acid) and 2.04 g (10 mmol) of aluminum iso-propoxide were added into the above solution with vigorous stirring. The mixture was covered with PE film, stirred at room temperature for about 5 h, and then put into a 60 \u00b0C drying oven to undergo the solvent evaporation process. After 2 days of aging, the solution became a light-yellow solid (when hydrochloric acid and citric acid were used, white solids were obtained). Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0C min -1 ramping rate) and by heating at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. High-temperature treatment was carried out in air for 1 h with a temperature ramp of 10 \u00b0C min -1 .Catalyst Preparation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSupported ruthenium catalysts containing 2 wt % ruthenium were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of as-synthesized mesoporous Al2O3 and for comparison, commercial Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar) with an aqueous solution of Ru(NO)(NO3) (Alfa Aesar) (denoted hereinafter as ruthenium/meso-Al2O3 and ruthenium/ commerical-Al2O3, respectively) at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h. Impregnated samples were dried in ambient air at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h and then reduced under flowing H2/N2 (10/90 v/v) at 350 \u00b0C for 6 h.Characterization.

The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 78.3 K were measured using an ASAP 2010 analyzer (Micromeritics Co.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n38 In our synthesis, high temperature and low relative humidity (<20%) are adopted by placing the reaction vessels in a drying oven with the temperature set at 60 \u00b0C. After evaporating for 2 days, the product has been totally condensed to a foam-like product without fluidity. Varying the evaporation time from 2 to 8 days, the same 2D hexagonal mesostructures are obtained, implying that it is the most stable mesostructure under this synthesis condition. Two days is a proper choice for the sake of synthesis efficiency.Ordered mesoporous aluminas are attained using different ethylene oxide-based surfactants via the same synthesis strategy. Poly(alkylene oxide) triblock copolymers like P123, F127(EO 106 -PO 70 EO 106 ), and F68(EO 77 PO 29 EO 77 ) are used as SDAs.

The 4th edition of the WHO classification incorporates new information that has emerged from scientific and clinical studies in the interval since the publication of the 3rd edition in 2001, and includes new criteria for the recognition of some previously described neoplasms as well as clarification and refinement of the defining criteria for others. It also adds entities-some defined principally by genetic features-that have only recently been characterized. In this paper, the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia is highlighted with the aim of familiarizing hematologists, clinical scientists, and hematopathologists not only with the major changes in the classification but also with the rationale for those changes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCorrelation/reporting of dataAll data should be assimilated into one report that states the WHO diagnosis.WHO indicates World Health Organization; PB, peripheral blood; BM, bone marrow; IHC, immunohistochemistry; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; APL, acute promyelocytic leukemia; NOS, not otherwise specified; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; and MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasm.dosage by quantitative RT-PCR is not practical on a daily basis, nor have gene expression arrays been introduced into routine use, and therefore such data are not included in this revision.\nRevised WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemiaTable 2 lists the major subgroups of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia in the WHO classification, and the specific entities of which they are composed. The nomenclature for the myeloproliferative entities is changed from \"chronic myeloproliferative disease\" to \"myeloproliferative neoplasms\" in order to accurately reflect their neoplastic nature.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n77 One of the major challenges in the revision of the WHO classification of AML was how to incorporate important and/or recently described genetic aberrations into a classification scheme of AML and yet adhere to the WHO principle of defining homogeneous, biologically relevant, and mutually exclusive entities based not only on the prognostic value of a genetic abnormality, but on morphologic, clinical, phenotypic, and/or other unique biologic properties. This was particularly problematic for the most frequent and prognostically important mutations currently recognized in cytogenetically normal AML, mutated FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA. These mutations are associated with few, if any, entirely consistent morphologic or clinical features. Most notably, they are not entirely mutually exclusive of each other or, particularly in the case of FLT3, of other well-recognized cytogenetic defects. 20,78 Yet, in the context of cytogenetically normal AML, they are each important prognostic factors.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMore study is needed to clarify these questions, thus RCC is considered as a provisional entity. \nSignificant changes in the diagnosis and classification of MDS\nAcute myeloid leukemia and related precursor neoplasmsThe previous edition of the WHO classification ushered in the era of incorporation of genetic abnormalities into diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of AML. The 4 abnormalities initially included in the subgroup \"AML with recurring genetic abnormalities\" involved rearrangements of genes (RUNX1, CBFB, RARA, and MLL) that encode transcription factors and that are associated with fairly distinct clinical and morphologic features. Since the publication of the 3rd edition of the classification, it has become more widely appreciated that multiple genetic lesions-including not only microscopically detectable chromosomal rearrangements or numerical abnormalities but also submicroscopic gene mutations-cooperate to establish the leukemic process and influence its morphologic and clinical characteristics.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The theory generalizes previous treatments of the effects of gain and openness described by the Petermann factor. The linewidth is expressed using quantities based on the nonlinear scattering matrix, which can be computed from steady-state ab initio laser theory; unlike previous treatments, no passive cavity or phenomenological parameters are involved. We find that low cavity quality factor, combined with significant dielectric dispersion, can cause substantial deviations from the Shawlow-Townes-Petermann theory. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe third correction and the main focus of this Letter is the Petermann factor, K. First discovered in the context of transverse gain-guided semiconductor lasers [4] and subsequently generalized [2,[5][6][7][8][9][10], this factor arises from the non-Hermitian nature of the laser wave equation, due to the presence of the gain medium as well as the openness of the laser cavity (i.e. spatially non-uniform outcoupling loss). It always leads to an enhancement of the linewidth, even with uniform gain and no gain-guiding. Typically, it is calculated from the non-orthogonal passive cavity resonances asK = dr |\u03d5(r)| 2 dr \u03d5(r) 2 2 ,(2)where the integrals are taken over the cavity [11]. In effect, the Petermann factor changes the ST linewidth by the replacement \u03b3 2 c \u2192 K\u03b3 2 c . This is a significant correction for lasers with large outcoupling, in the range 1.1-1.6 for the conventional semiconductor lasers studied in Ref. [2].\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[2]. We shall refer to the standard theory, inclusive of the Petermann factor, as the Schawlow-Townes-Petermann (STP) theory.The extensive and impressive literature on the Petermann factor [2,[4][5][6][7][8][9][10]12] has, with one major exception [9], only treated single-mode lasing near threshold, neglecting the effects of spatial hole-burning. And apart from a recent paper by Schomerus [12], the literature has exclusively treated one-dimensional or waveguide lasers, and thus is not directly applicable to the wide variety of complex laser cavities developed during the past twenty years, such as microdisk and deformed-disk, photonic crystal, and random lasers. In this Letter, we derive a general formula for the intrinsic laser linewidth in arbitrary cavities, which is valid far from threshold, with strong spatial hole-burning, and in the multimode regime.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor the random laser, at pump strengths up to four times threshold, \u03b3 L for the first lasing mode depends strongly on P , causing the overall power dependence to depart substantially from the standard 1/P dependence (Fig. 2). For higher pump strengths, \u03b3 L is approximately constant, but the conventional linewidth prefactor K\u03b3 2 c overestimates it by almost a factor of two. In the standard theory, the STP linewidth is expected to be a lower bound set by field quantization, but insofar as the usual STP formula relies on passive cavity quantities it is not a reliable bound. Analysis of our results indicates that this deviation from the STP theory arises from low cavity Q and from the frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant of the gain medium, which cause a significant reduction of the residue of the lasing pole at threshold compared to its value in the passive cavity. We do not believe that the apparent violation of the STP bound indicates any new quantum fluctuation properties of the laser. In future work, our generalized linewidth formula will allow such issues to be studied systematically.This research was partially supported by NSF grant No. DMR-0908437, and by NRF (Singapore) grant No.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTranscribed strand information was assigned to the individual reads based on knowledge of the fragment type (left or right) and the aligned strand of the genome. Both Cufflinks (version 0.9.3) 2 and Scripture 3 (version VPaperR3, obtained from Scripture author Manuel Garber) were executed on these alignments.\nEvaluation of published de novo methodsIllumina reads were de novo assembled using ABySS 1 (version 1.2.1), SOAPdenovo 6 (version 1.04) or Trans-ABySS 27 . Command-line parameters used with ABySS were \"abyss-pe k=25 E=0 n=10 in= 'left.fa right.fa' \", employing a K-mer length of 25. Likewise, a 25-mer length was employed with SOAPdenovo along with other default parameters. Trans-ABySS 27 was run on Mouse and S. pombe using a set of k-mers including 26, 31, 36, 41, and 46 followed by merging the results by running the 1 st stage of the trans-ABySS analysis pipeline.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n5a). Trinity performed well across a range of 10M to the full 150M input sequence reads, while the alternative methods tended to peak at ~50M pairs or smaller inputs (Supplementary Fig. 6a online). In mouse (RefSeq annotation set, Fig. 5b), Trinity (8185 transcripts, 7749 genes) outperformed the other de novo assembly methods ABySS (5561, 5500), Trans-ABySS (7025, 6598) and SOAPdenovo (761, 760), with the mapping-first programs Cufflinks (9010, 8536) and Scripture (9086, 8293) exhibiting better sensitivity. Furthermore, Trinity and Cufflinks appear best-tuned in their sensitivity across the broadest range of expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). Unlike Trinity, several of the de novo methods did not perform well in fully reconstructing transcripts within the highest expression quintiles (Supplementary Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(1) 'Mapping first' approaches 5 , such as Scripture 3 or Cufflinks 2 , first align all the reads to a reference (unannotated) genome and then merge sequences with overlapping alignment, spanning splice junctions with reads and paired-ends. (2) 'Assembly first' (de novo) methods, such as ABySS 1 , SOAPdenovo 6 or Oases (E. Birney, personal communication), use the reads to assemble transcripts directly, which can subsequently be mapped to a reference genome, if available. 'Mapping-first' approaches promise, in principle, maximum sensitivity, but depend on correct read-to-reference alignment, a task that is complicated by splicing, sequencing errors, and the lack or incompleteness of many reference genomes. Conversely, 'assembly first' approaches do not require any read-reference alignments, important when the genomic sequence is not available, is gapped, highly fragmented, or substantially altered, as in cancer cells. Successful 'mapping first' methods were developed in the past year 4 , but substantially less progress was made to date in developing effective 'assembly first' approaches.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify (1) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., areas of natural \"resistance\" to bleaching) and (2) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred (i.e., areas of natural community \"resilience\"). These \"target areas,\" where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, Salm et al. (2001) have proposed that through thoughtful planning and strategic care of reefs within existing and future marine protected areas (MPAs)*, it may be possible to take advantage in two broad ways of the natural properties of coral reef ecosystems to mitigate the negative impact of bleaching on coral reef biodiversity:(1) Identify and manage specific patches of reef where local conditions are likely to result in reduced temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., coral assemblages with a high level of \"resistance\") to protect them from direct anthropogenic impacts. (2) Enhance the capacity for coral reef recovery (\"resilience\") by maintaining conditions optimal for larval dispersal and recruitment to damaged sites (requires minimizing other stresses at these sites [abatement of direct localized impacts] and analyzing larval dispersal [connectivity] to maximize recolonization).An understanding of which local environmental factors are predictors of greatest resistance and resilience to coral bleaching would help managers identify, design, and manage networks of MPAs in order to maximize overall survival of the world's coral reefs in the face of global climate change.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe most useful approach would be one that utilizes natural processes rather than expensive technological fixes and helps managers focus local management and enforcement efforts on the most criti-cal areas. Given the limited capacity and funding available for management in many coral-reef countries, what is especially needed are simple tractable strategies that any manager could begin to adopt immediately to maximize long-term survival of the broadest range of coral communities and reef types.We confine our discussion to local-scale resistance that occurs despite the presence of \"mass bleaching conditions\" in an area or region. This resistance is distinct from avoidance, in which large areas or regions may never be tested by bleaching conditions at all due to larger-scale climatological and oceanographic phenomena ( Done 2001 ). Although the latter is an important area of ongoing research, here we focus on determinants of local-scale resistance within areas or regions that have experienced bleaching conditions, because this is an important scale at which local managers work. Therefore, building on the work of Salm et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nGROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe massive scale of the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o-associated coral bleaching event underscores the need for strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses resulting from temperature-induced coral mortality.

This opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for microarrays.

Fragments were mapped to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Build 37.2 of the human genome using the Subread aligner [58]. Fragment counts were summarized by Entrez Gene ID using the featureCounts function [59] of version 1.8.2 of the Bioconductor package Rsubread [60].

Fragments for which only one read mapped successfully contributed half a count if that read overlapped an exon. The summarized read count data is available from the voom webpage [56].The voom mean-variance trend shown in Figure 1a was obtained from all 16 libraries, treated as four groups.Genes were filtered out if they failed to achieve cpm > 1 in at least four libraries, and the remaining log-cpm values were quantile normalized between libraries [61].The comparison between technical replicates to check the type I error rate control used only the four group B libraries.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nGenes were filtered out if they failed to achieve a cpm > 1 in at least two libraries and the log-cpm values for the 16,745 remaining genes were quantile normalized.

When the sequencing depths are different, voom is the clear best performer.Either voom or limma-trend give RNA-seq analysts immediate access to many techniques developed for microarrays that are not otherwise available for RNAseq, including all the quality weighting, random effects and gene set testing techniques mentioned above. This article presents two case studies that demonstrate how voom can handle heterogeneous data and complex experiments as well as facilitating pathway analysis and gene set testing.\nResults\nCounts per million: a simple interpretable scale for assessing differential expressionWe suppose that RNA-seq profiles (or libraries) are available for a set of n RNA samples.

To identify the genetic alterations in this tumor type, we searched for copy number alterations using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and microRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 MBs. We found that, on average, each tumor had 11 gene alterations, fewer by a factor of 5 to 10 than in the adult solid tumors that have been sequenced to date. In addition to alterations in the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, our analysis led to the discovery of genes not previously known to be altered in MBs. Most notably, inactivating mutations of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase genes MLL2 or MLL3 were identified in 16% of MB patients. These results demonstrate key differences between the genetic landscapes of adult and childhood cancers, highlight dysregulation of developmental pathways as an important mechanism underlying MBs, and identify a role for a specific type of histone methylation in human tumorigenesis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt should thus be informative to characterize the methylation status of histones and DNA in MBs with and without MLL2/MLL3 gene alterations, as well as to determine the expression changes resulting from these gene mutations. These data highlight the important connection between genetic alterations in the cancer genome and epigenetic pathways and provide potentially new avenues for research and disease management in MB patients.    \u2020 Based on 21 nonhypermutable tumors analyzed in (19). \u2021 Based on 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors analyzed in (16,17).\u00a7 Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total non-silent mutations. ^Ratio of observed to expected nonsense alterations is dependent on mutation spectra in each tumor type (21). ** Includes synonymous as well as nonsynonymous point mutations identified in the indicated study. \u2020 \u2020 Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total substitutionsFig. 1 .1Fig. 1. Number of genetic alterations detected through sequencing and copy number analyses in each of the 22 cancers.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis genetic evidence is consistent with functional studies showing that knock-out of murine MLL3 results in ureteral epithelial cancers (29). These genes are large and have been reported in the COSMIC database to be altered in occasional cancers, but not at a sufficiently high frequency to distinguish them from passenger alterations (and with no evidence of a high fraction of inactivating mutations) (30). Interestingly, inactivating germline mutations of MLL2 have recently been identified as a cause of Kabuki syndrome, a multiple malformation disorder without known cancer predisposition (31).The general role of genes controlling histone methylation has become increasingly recognized as a common feature of human cancers. For example, inactivating mutations of the histone H3K27 demethylase gene UTX have been observed in multiple myelomas, esophageal cancers and renal cell cancers (32). In addition, a small fraction of renal cell cancers contain mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2 and the histone demethylase gene JARID1C (33), and the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 has been found to be mutated in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (34).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe probability that by chance alone 11 of the 15 mutations in the two histone methyltransferase genes would cause truncations is very small (p<0.001, binomial test). All truncating mutations in MLL2 and MLL3 were predicted to result in protein products lacking the key methyltransferase domain (Fig. 2). These data not only provide strong evidence that these pathways are important to MBs, but they also show that MLL2 and MLL3 are, on the basis of genetic criteria, tumor suppressor genes that are inactivated by mutation.Discussion. These data provide a comprehensive view of a solid tumor arising in children. The most impressive difference between this tumor type and those affecting adults is the number of genetic alterations observed. This result could not have been predicted on the basis of prior evidence (27). In fact, at the karyotypic level, the incidence of chromosomal changes in MBs is often described as high as that in adult solid tumors [reviewed in (27)].What does the smaller number of mutations reveal about the tumorigenesis of MBs? Most mutations observed in adult tumors are predicted to be passenger alterations (19).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.\nResults: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.\nAvailability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFurthermore, the processing steps would not be able to assess the read pair as a unit, which is necessary or at least advantageous in some cases.The alternative approach of executing a series of tools in succession would involve the creation of intermediate files at each step, a non-trivial overhead given the data size involved, and would still require pair-awareness to be built into every tool used. These issues suggest that the typical approaches to achieve flexibility by combining multiple single-purpose tools are not optimal.Thus, although many NGS read preprocessing tools exist, none of them, alone or in combination, could offer the desired flexibility and performance, and most were not designed to work on paired-end data. As a result, we developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible, pair-aware and efficient preprocessing tool, optimized for Illumina NGS data.\nALGORITHMSTrimmomatic includes a variety of processing steps for read trimming and filtering, but the main algorithmic innovations are related to identification of adapter sequences and quality filtering, and are described in detail below. A list of the other processing steps is presented in the Supplementary Materials.\nRemoval of technical sequencesTrimmomatic uses two approaches to detect technical sequences within the reads.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nQuality filteringTrimmomatic offers two main quality filtering alternatives. Both approaches exploit the Illumina quality score of each base position to determine where the read should be cut, resulting in the retention of the 5 0 portion, while the sequence on the 3 0 of the cut point is discarded. This fits well with typical Illumina data, which generally have poorer quality toward the 3 0 end. These two approaches are described in the following sections.\nSliding Window quality filteringThe Sliding Window uses a relatively standard approach. This works by scanning from the 5 0 end of the read, and removes the 3 0 end of the read when the average quality of a group of bases drops below a specified threshold. This prevents a single weak base causing the removal of subsequent high-quality data, while still ensuring that a consecutive series of poor-quality bases will trigger trimming.\nMaximum Information quality filteringA novel alternative approach was motivated by the realization that, for many applications, the incremental value of retaining additional bases in a read is related to the read length. Intuitively, it is clear that short reads are almost worthless because they occur multiple times within the target sequence and thus they give only ambiguous information.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nwe could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance.

Furthermore, given the rate with which NGS sequence data are currently being produced (Mardis, 2008), the additional burden of sequence preprocessing must be kept relatively modest so as to avoid adding undue overhead to the bioinformatics pipeline.The preprocessing approach must also not interfere with the downstream analysis of the data.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In a user-friendly format with one single function call, our package downloads and fully processes the desired TCGA data to be seamlessly integrated into a computational analysis pipeline. No further technical or biological knowledge is needed to utilize our software, thus making TCGA data easily accessible to data scientists without specific domain knowledge.\nAvailability and implementation: TCGA2STAT is available from the https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TCGA2STAT/index.html \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe TCGA data can be downloaded from web portals or via web services, such as the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/), cBio (Cerami et al., 2012;Gao et al., 2013), canEvolve (Samur et al., 2013), or Broad Institute GDAC Firehose (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). However, manual download of this massive data is time consuming and web service calls like the firehose_get function require additional program installation and technical setup. Most importantly, these two approaches cannot be easily integrated into a framework for statistical analysis. Many extra steps and technical knowledge of molecular platform data formats are needed to wrangle and pre-process the data before it can be statistically analyzed. Further, this process must be repeated when new data versions or additional samples become available, hindering efforts at version-control and reproducible research.Others have provided software to obtain the TCGA data. cBio, for example, provides an R and Matlab package but was not designed to be used for genome-scale data analysis.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt requires input of a list of genes from users and thus limits the exploratory use of the data. Another R package, RTCGAToolbox downloads TCGA data from Firehose (Samur, 2014), but the downloaded data is not preprocessed into data formats conducive for multivariate statistical analysis. Further, linking and merging functions necessary for integrated statistical analyses such as sample matching across multiple platforms and merging clinical and molecular data are not available in this package.Because of these problems, use of the TCGA data can be limited to those with domain expertise, rendering the data inaccessible for general data scientists. In response, we have developed an R package TCGA2STAT that makes the TCGA data in the open access data tier easily accessible to all by downloading, wrangling and pre-processing the data into a data matrix or list of matrices ready for multivariate or integrated statistical analyses. The package imports both molecular profiles and clinical data of more than thirty cancer types profiled with more than eleven high-throughput genomics platforms, including microarray, sequencing, methylation array, SNP array and array-CGH (See a full list in vignette).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOur package supports over thirty different cancer types and eleven different data platforms.

Neural electrodes that are close-packed, such as in tetrodes, enable spatial oversampling of neural activity, which facilitates data analysis. Here we present the design and implementation of close-packed silicon microelectrodes, to enable spatially oversampled recording of neural activity in a scalable fashion.\nMethods\nOur probes are fabricated in a hybrid lithography process, resulting in a dense array of recording sites connected to submicron dimension wiring.\nResults\nWe demonstrate an implementation of a probe comprising 1000 electrode pads, each 9 \u00d7 9 \u03bcm, at a pitch of 11 \u03bcm. We introduce design automation and packaging methods that allow us to readily create a large variety of different designs.\nSignificance\nFinally, we perform neural recordings with such probes in the live mammalian brain that illustrate the spatial oversampling potential of closely packed electrode sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nfrom a dense array [12]- [15]. In this paper, we demonstrate a close-packed silicon microelectrode technology that enables a tight continuum of recording sites along the length of the shank (Fig. 1), rather than discrete arrangements of tetrode-style pads or widely spaced sites. This arrangement, thus, enables tetrodelike spatial oversampling continuously running down the shank, so that sorting of spikes recorded by such densely packed electrodes can be facilitated for all the sites of the probe simultaneously. We use advanced lithography tools to create these close-packed arrangements in a scalable fashion, demonstrating probes with 1000 electrode pads situated on five shanks with 200 recording sites per shank. A key challenge with the traditional silicon electrode designs has been that wiring to the recording sites occupied a large fraction of the available shank width. This is problematic because scaling up the number of recording sites forces the shank geometry to widen, placing an upper bound on the number of sites practical for a single shank of a given width. We here reduced the wire geometry and, thus, the overhead that the wiring places on the shank width by creating submicron wires with high-speed electron beam lithography (EBL).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe in vivo experiment and quantitative electrode site impedance and noise characterization demonstrated that by closely packing recording sites, we are able to spatially oversample and pick up unit activity on several recording sites at a time, and that the size of the recording sites can be reduced even lower than 9 \u03bcm. Our results suggest that close-packed electrodes may become not only instrumental for neuroscience, but also for understanding the basic principles of electrode design when scaling to large channel counts is required. We note that our current technologies are not designed for long-term recording, which may benefit from probes that are coated with alternative materials [27], as well as thinner probes that may be more flexible [28]; our main focus here was on the principles of scalability, as well as acute recordings. Future work may enable such scalable devices to be deployed in both chronic and acute settings, as well as allow integration with other technologies such as 3-D light delivery for optogenetics [29]- [31], and the ability to connect spatial localization of neurons with detailed anatomical mapping via high-resolution microscopy [32].Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

Structural studies have shed light on this and other chromatin modifying machines, but much less is known about how they assemble and whether stable and functional sub-modules exist that retain enzymatic activity. Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular the chromatin remodeler CHD4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via preformed and active sub-modules. These retain enzymatic activity and are present in both the nucleus and the cytosol, an outcome with important implications for understanding NuRD function. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAlthough the mechanisms are not yet clear, deacetylation of histone H3K27 by NuRD leads to recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 resulting in subsequent H3K27 trimethylation at NuRD-controlled promoters [11].In mammalian cells, the NuRD complex is known to comprise helicase-containing nucleosome remodeling ATPases (CHD3/4/5), histone deacetylases (HDAC1/ 2), histone chaperones (RbAp46/48), methyl-cytosine DNA-binding domain proteins (MBD2/3), metastasis tumor antigens (MTA1/2/3), and the GATA-type zinc finger proteins (GATAD2a/b) (for recent reviews, see refs. [12,13]). [In Drosophila, the corresponding proteins are as follows: Mi-2 (CHD4), Rpd3 (HDAC1/2), p55 (RbAp46/48), MBD-like, MTA-like, and Simjang (GATAD2a/b). Note -we use CHD4 instead of Mi-2 throughout this paper.]\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThere are also structures of isolated domains, including the PHD domains [18] and the chromodomains (PDB code: 4O9I) of CHD4, the methyl-DNA binding domain of MBD2 [19], and the SANT domain of MTA3 (PDB code: 2CRG).To investigate NuRD assembly, we studied the Drosophila complex, where there is only a single gene for each major NuRD component. We exploited label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics of purified endogenous complexes, systematic co-expression/purification of NuRD components in insect cells using the MultiBac system, and biochemical and biophysical characterization of the sub-modules.\nResults\nPurification of Drosophila NuRD reveals a putative core complexWe employed a GFP-tagging approach [20,21] to purify the NuRD complex from Drosophila S2 Schneider cells. We modified an existing Gateway plasmid with a metallothionein promoter-driven expression cassette so that it expressed proteins with a GFP-TEV x2 -histidine x10 tandem affinity purification tag (Fig. 1a).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(d) MALDI-TOF analysis after an overnight deacetylation reaction of tetra-acetylated histone H4 (1-21) peptide by the dNuRD complex. Substrate peptides lacking up to four acetyl groups (complete deacetylation) are detected.We sought evidence for the hypothesis that a Simjang/MBD-like (or GATA2Da/b-MBD2/3) interaction is important for the association of the core PMMR deacetylase and CS chromatin-remodeling sub-modules, by carrying out single molecule tracking studies of CHD4 in the presence and absence of MBD3 in mESCs. The slowly moving molecules are not affected by the presence or absence of MBD3, and given the higher concentrations of CHD4 in the cell, and its known NuRD-independent functions, we suspect that they may correspond to CHD4 that is not associated with NuRD [38].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n7). Conversely, NT had the lowest bivariate correlations and higher point dispersions in their scatterplots. However, the distributions of their values were clearly distinct (Fig. 7) According to our new metric, most empirical matrices have degrees of nestedness between 40 and 70 (Fig. 7). Degrees of nestedness according to NODF were lower than those calculated using NT (Z 0(8.37, p B0.001) and Nd1 (Z 0(8.83, pB0.001). NT also produced higher degrees of nestedness when compared to Nd1 (Z 0(2.06, pB0.039). Respectively, 92.3% and 99.6% of the empirical matrices examined by NT and Nd1 had higher degrees of nestedness than NODF. These differences were similar when degrees of nestedness obtained by NT and Nd1 were compared to NODF only among sites and only among species occupancy (p B0.001 for the four comparisons). NODF identified 237 of the 287 empirical matrices as being significantly nested under the EE null model.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFinally, it is important to highlight that NODF was thought to be dependent on the arrangement of columns and rows to allow testing hypotheses on the causes of nestedness by ordering columns and rows according to any reasoned criteria instead of only by the marginal totals.\nConsistency with the concept of nestednessWe evaluated the consistency of T, C, d1 and NODF with the usual concept of nestedness using model matrices. Given that values of C and NODF increase with nestedness, whereas values of T and d1 decrease with nestedness, we used NT 0100(T and Nd10(1 (d1)100. It does not  1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOn the other hand, under the FF null model NODF identified only three empirical matrices as being nested. NODF also indicated that nestedness in species occupancy (mean 054.0) is significantly lower than nestedness in species composition among sites (mean 060.6; Z 0(9.25, pB0.001).\nDiscussionWhy another metric?The occurrence of nestedness in ecological systems provides clues about the processes that affect species distributions among different sites and that shape interspecific interactions (Lomolino 1996, Leibold and Mikkelson 2002, Thompson 2005, 2006, Lewinsohn et al. 2006, Guimara \u02dces et al. 2007b). In addition, its quantification can be used to guide conservation strategies (Atmar and Patterson 1993, Cutler 1991, 1994, Boecklen 1997) and to understand the fragility and co-evolution of networks of ecological interactions (Thompson 2005, 2006, Jordano et al. 2006). Therefore, it is fundamental to measure such structure properly.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, single-cell differences have been largely neglected in the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation. Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function--such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells--are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n10). Forty-eight cells in each of 30 samples (15 baseline and 15 perturbed cell lines) were assayed using a combination of flow cytometry and microfluidic gene expression chips 8 (Online Methods).We observed variability both in the average gene expression values as well as distribution of expression values between the 15 individuals in both the unperturbed and inhibitor-treated cell populations (Fig. 1b,c). A number of parameters can be deduced from these data and the correlation of these to genetic variants tested.Considering gene expression phenotypes in terms of single-cell distributions provides important information about gene regulation, as the noise from the regulation of transcription can be considered separately from the noise of RNA turnover (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus constitutively expressed genes, for example, are expected to be less noisy, demonstrating mostly the thermodynamic noise of RNA turnover in the absence of variable regulation (Supplementary Fig. 1). Analyzing four, public, single-cell RNA sequencing data sets 6,7 , we found that this is indeed the case (Supplementary Notes, section 1).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis is most commonly seen when cancer somatic variations result in pronounced transcriptomic changes. Theoretical discussions around concepts such as self-organizing criticality 3 have proven popular as attempts at explaining this observed complexity of gene expression and its regulation. The same lack of 'smoothness' can be seen with the environmental perturbation of gene expression-as recently demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-exposed immune cells 4 -and is likely to become an important theme in the pharmacogenomics of gene function.Although a number of disease-associated genetic variants have been shown to be linked to eQTLs 5 , in most cases no such correlation exists. We hypothesize that instead of influencing the average gene expression of a gene in a whole organism or a specific cell type or tissue, these variants might change the cell-to-cell variability, temporal dynamics or cell cycle dependence of gene expression at the single-cell level.Here we explore whether studying individual cells can begin to provide greater mechanistic insights into how SNPs quantitatively affect gene function, as opposed to just assaying their effects on average tissue expression.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOur results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression.Human, clinical, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to correlate genetic variants with disease and pharmacogenomic traits, typically in a hypothesis-free manner. To investigate the mechanisms underpinning these statistical associations, molecular phenotyping technologies have also been used to associate traits such as gene expression with genetic variants. Progress has been slow, with tissue specificity, the low resolution of DNA genotypes and the technical challenges of assaying molecular traits all thought to be important limiting factors 1 .The most commonly studied molecular trait is baseline, wholetissue gene expression. In these studies, genetic variants that are associated with variation in gene expression are referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) 2 . A trait with 'smooth' variation between individuals due to many small contributing factors is treated as being quantitative (continuous) in epidemiological models. However, this is a simplistic treatment of gene expression as a trait, as its genetic perturbation need not result in the smooth variation of expression.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The ignimbrite is crystal rich (20\u201330%), of rhyodacite to low-silica rhyolite composition and lacks any consistent compositional zonation. Pumice whole-rock and glass compositions and crystal rim chemistries imply that the final erupted magma body was, to a first order, homogeneous, with the only variations reflecting crystal:glass proportions in analysed clasts. Crystals from pumices can be divided into two populations based on textural and chemical signatures: those that are inferred to have grown within the final erupted magma body (82% of plagioclase, 88% of orthopyroxene, 17% of amphibole), and those that originated in a chemically heterogeneous mush zone (18% of plagioclase, 12% of orthopyroxene, 83% of amphibole). Crystal-rich microcrystalline clasts, and clots within pumices, provide direct samples of parts of this heterogeneous source region. Amphibole model temperatures and pressures, coupled with in-situ trace element concentrations suggest that the mush region extended to ~ 15 km depth, near the base of the quartzofeldspathic crust and was rich in amphibole. Amphibole plus subordinate plagioclase and orthopyroxene, as well as antecrystic zircon were extracted from the crystal mush and ascended to a final storage region. Model temperatures and pressures from amphibole rims and Fe\u2013Ti oxide model temperatures imply that the final erupted magma body was stored between 770 and 840 \u00b0C at 4\u20136 km depths. Homogenisation of the magma body occurred through convective stirring accompanying gradually rising temperatures induced by less-evolved magma(s) emplaced at deeper levels. Plagioclase records a steady core-to-rim increase in An content, implying that a gradual heating and/or increase in H2O in the final erupted magma body occurred over some significant period prior to the eruption. No signals of a rapid defrosting or rejuvenation event that could be considered as an eruption trigger are recorded by the crystal phases. The Ongatiti ignimbrite has features both common to, and distinct from crystal rich \u2018monotonous intermediates\u2019 and crystal-poor compositionally zoned rhyolites. As such, the Ongatiti ignimbrite demonstrates that \u2018monotonous rhyolites\u2019 can also be developed on a large scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThese temperature and oxygen fugacity estimates fall between the NNO and FMQ buffer curves (Fig. 11a).\nAmphibole temperature and pressureAmphiboles have the potential to record magmatic temperature and pressure changes during growth of the crystal (Johnson and Rutherford, 1989;Rutherford and Devine, 2003). Estimates of apparent temperature and pressure were made on amphiboles using the method of Ridolfi et al. (2010). Amphibole cores display a large and continuous range in apparent temperatures and pressures from 780 to 970 \u00b0C and 110 to 390 MPa (Figs. 11b andS5). Model temperatures and pressures of rims are significantly restricted in comparison, and range from 780 to 840 \u00b0C and 110 to 170 MPa (Figs. 11b andS5). These conditions correspond to model depths of amphibole core crystallisation between ~4 to 15 km and final pre-eruptive depths (crystallisation of rims) at shallower crustal levels between ~4 to 6 km (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n11b).The range in modelled pre-eruptive conditions, and the contrast in modelled pressures and temperatures between rims and cores correspond well with independently determined in-situ trace element concentrations. The lower depth of pre-eruptive conditions (~6 km) is marked by a significant change in amphibole chemistry at Al T values of ~0.4 and Eu/Eu* of ~0.3 (dashed line in Fig. 8). The maximum estimated depth of ~15 km is consistent with the estimated depth (~16 km) of the base of the quartzo-feldspathic crust beneath much of the central TVZ (e.g., Harrison and White, 2006). The exact depth of the crust beneath Mangakino (to the north west of modelled seismic arrays) is, however, not well constrained. The validity of model amphibole temperatures and pressures was assessed using cation abundances calculated following the method of Leake et al. (2004). Evidence for both temperature (edenite and Ti-Tschermak) and pressure (Al-tschermak) sensitive atomic substitution mechanisms are found across the whole amphibole dataset (cf.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSecond, the use of other Al-in-amphibole barometers also yield pressures broadly consistent with those from the formulation of Ridolfi et al. (2010). Third, the Ongatiti ignimbrite contains scarce lithic fragments of basement schist (Krippner et al., 1998), in addition to the low-grade greywacke metasediment (which is ubiquitous in New Zealand ignimbrites), suggesting that deeper crustal levels (N ~10 km) were being excavated (cf. Mortimer, 2000). The extraction of crystals from an amphibole bearing mush at mid-crustal depths has also been suggested in the case of the Matahina eruption (Deering, 2009;Deering et al., 2011).\nHeterogeneity to homogeneity in the Ongatiti magma bodyThe textural and compositional signatures from crystal cores in Ongatiti pumices suggest that a relatively evolved and uniform meltdominant magma body was assembled at shallow levels from a large and diverse source region from variable depths in the crust (Fig. 12).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The exact reaction process by which they originate is still debated and their hybrid nature is controversial. We show that textural and chemical inheritances of the pre-existing mantle are preserved in olivine-rich troctolites recently sampled at the Central Indian Ridge. The occurrence of a large orthopyroxene of a probable mantle origin suggests that these rocks formed through the reactive overprint of a mantle peridotite. Combining our data with those of olivine-rich troctolites worldwide, we show that the clinopyroxenes from these rocks follow chemical trends slightly distinct to those of the oceanic gabbros. These chemical trends can be ascribed to crystallization from melts assimilating mantle peridotites, suggesting that a \u201cmantle flavor\u201d can be locally retained in these hybrid rocks. The present distribution of Ol-rich troctolites suggests that melt-mantle reaction processes by which these rocks originate is likely to be more diffuse at slower spreading environments, where extensive melt-rock reactions within a thick thermal boundary layer enhances the conversion of the shallow oceanic mantle into hybrid crustal rocks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe case for reactive crystallization at mid-ocean ridges\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMLCollier\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPBKelemen\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Petrology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t51\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEvidence from oceanic gabbros for porous melt migration within a crystal mush beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLACoogan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADSaunders\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPDKempton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJNorry\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEarth and Planetary Science Letters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t176\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe lower oceanic crust\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLCoogan\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTreatise on Geochemistry 3.19\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKKTurekian\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKDHolland\n\t\t\n\t\tAmsterdam\n\t\t\n\t\t\tElsevier\n\t\t\t2007\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA neodymium and strontium isotopic study of the Mesozoic calc-alkaline granitic batholiths of the Sierra Nevada and Peninsula Ranges, California\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDJDepaolo\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Geophysical Research\n\t\t\n\t\t\t86\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1981\n\nExcerpt 2: \nGeochemical and petrographic evidence for magmatic impregnation in the oceanic lithosphere at Atlantis Massif, Mid-Atlantic Ridge (IODP Hole U1309D, 30\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMDrouin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGodard\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBIldefonse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOBruguier\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJGarrido\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChemical Geology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t264\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2009\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA microstructural imprint of melt impregnation in slow-spread lithosphere: olivine-rich troctolites from the Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge 30\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMDrouin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBIldefonse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGodard\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1029/2009GC002995\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIODP Hole U1309D)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\t\t\t11\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPetrology of gabbroic rocks from the Mid-Cayman Rise spreading center\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDElthon\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Geophysical Research\n\t\t\n\t\t\t92\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1987\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMelt-rock reaction in the lower ocean crust and its implications for the genesis of mid-ocean ridge basalt\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJLissenberg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHJ BDick\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEarth and Planetary Science Letters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t271\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2008\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPervasive reactive melt migration through fast-spreading lower oceanic rust (Hess Deep, equatorial Pacific Ocean)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJLissenberg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKAHoward\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCJMacleod\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMGodard\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEarth and Planetary Science Letters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t361\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIgneous, alteration and exhumation processes recorded in abyssal peridotites and related fault rocks from an Oceanic Core Complex along the Central Indian Ridge\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTMorishita\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKHara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKNakamura\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTSawaguchi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTamura\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSArai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKOkino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKTakai\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHKumagai\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJournal of Petrology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2009\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[citation 9] shows that for this structure, electrons in SMH are close to the free-electron limit, which supports the application of a Drude model.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Anharmonic effects in atomic hydrogen: Superconductivity and lattice dynamical stability \nAbstract: We present first-principles calculations of metallic atomic hydrogen in the 400\u2013600 GPa pressure range in a tetragonal structure with space group I41/amd, which is predicted to be its first atomic phase. Our calculations show a band structure close to the free-electron-like limit due to the high electronic kinetic energy induced by pressure. Bands are properly described even in the independent electron approximation fully neglecting the electron-electron interaction. Linear-response harmonic calculations show a dynamically stable phonon spectrum with marked Kohn anomalies. Even if the electron-electron interaction has a minor role in the electronic bands, the inclusion of electronic exchange and correlation in the density response is essential to obtain a dynamically stable structure. Anharmonic effects, which are calculated within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, harden high-energy optical modes and soften transverse acoustic modes up to a 20% in energy. Despite a large impact of anharmonicity has been predicted in several high-pressure hydrides, here the superconducting critical temperature is barely affected by anharmonicity, as it is lowered from its harmonic 318 K value only to 300 K at 500 GPa. We attribute the small impact of anharmonicity on superconductivity to the absence of softened optical modes and the fairly uniform distribution of the electron-phonon coupling among the vibrational modes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(a) Conventional unit cell of I41/amd hydrogen.

(a) Electronic band structure of I41/amd hydrogen at 500 GPa calculated within DFT, where the self-consistent potential is V scf = Ve,p + VH + Vxc. Bands obtained within the free-electron approach (V scf = 0) and the independent-electron approach (V scf = Ve,p) are also shown. The origin of energy (black dotted line) corresponds to the Fermi level. (b) Fermi surface of I41/amd hydrogen at 500 GPa within DFT. The BZ and its high-symmetry points are shown.\nFigure 4 .4Figure 4. Lindhard RPA phonons of I41/amd hydrogen at 500 GPa, decomposed into the contributions coming from the Dp and De terms.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, in the analyzed pressure range we are still close to the dissociation/metalization pressure 23 and the problem is not as simple as one could imagine a priori.Fig. 2a shows the electronic band structure of I4 1 /amd hydrogen at 500 GPa. The bands present a huge dispersion, associated to the dominating kinetic term in the energies of the electronic states. The calculated band structure is not far from the free-electron approximation, the main difference being the band gaps opened at the border of the BZ and whenever band crossing occurs due to the interaction of the electrons with the proton lattice. It is interesting to point out that if we consider the independent electron approximation, just keeping the V e,p term that gives the electron-proton interaction in the V scf selfconsistent potential and neglecting the V H Hartree and V xc electron-electron interactions (see Appendix for details), the resulting bands match almost perfectly with the DFT ones. Therefore, we can conclude that main differences with the free-electron approximation are due to the large proton-electron interaction, and that the interaction between the electrons is not giving any significant contribution to the band structure. Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nConsidering the validity of the free-electron-like approximation to describe the electronic band structure, we have calculated the phonon dispersion within this approximation, assuming that the D e contribution to the dynamical matrix can be calculated with the Lindhard response function at the RPA level as in Ref. 41, therefore, neglecting correlation and exchange in the electronic response. In this free-electron limit we can obtain the spectra along high-symmetry lines without any Fourier interpolation, evidencing the presence of the Kohn anomalies at the |q + G| = 2k f points, and confirming that the kinks present in the DFPT result are Kohn anomalies.Nevertheless, the Lindhard RPA spectrum completely differs from the ab initio calculations. The intensity of the Kohn anomalies is much stronger and the transverse acoustic modes become unstable with imaginary frequencies. Therefore, even though the electronic band structure could be understood within the free-electron-like approximation, phonons seem to be far from this picture, contrary to the case of sodium 41,46 . This fact also questions the stability of the I4 1 /amd tetragonal phase in the ultimate high-pressure limit where the electrons are expected to be free.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These are (i) B\u2013O (boroxine, boronate ester, borosilicate, and spiroborate); (ii) C=N (imine, hydrazone, and squaraine); (iii) C=N(aromatic) (triazine and phenazine) [citation 38]; (iv) C=C (alkene); (v) C\u2013N (\u03b2-ketoenamine, imide, and amide); and (vi) B=N (borazine) or N=N (azodioxy).\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Conjugated organic framework with three-dimensionally ordered stable structure and delocalized \u03c0 clouds \nAbstract: Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline organic porous materials that can utilize \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions as a driving force for the crystallization of polygonal sheets to form layered frameworks and ordered pores. However, typical examples are chemically unstable and lack intrasheet \u03c0-conjugation, thereby significantly limiting their applications. Here we report a chemically stable, electronically conjugated organic framework with topologically designed wire frameworks and open nanochannels, in which the \u03c0 conjugation-spans the two-dimensional sheets. Our framework permits inborn periodic ordering of conjugated chains in all three dimensions and exhibits a striking combination of properties: chemical stability, extended \u03c0-delocalization, ability to host guest molecules and hole mobility. We show that the \u03c0-conjugated organic framework is useful for high on-off ratio photoswitches and photovoltaic cells. Therefore, this strategy may constitute a step towards realizing ordered semiconducting porous materials for innovations based on two-dimensionally extended \u03c0 systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTwo-dimensional (2D) COFs are characterized by their periodically ordered columnar p arrays and aligned one-dimensional nanochannels  , which are rarely available in other molecular architectures. In addition to traditional boronate [7][8][9]11,[13][14][15][17][18][19][20][21]23,[25][26][27] and boroxine 7,10 linkages, hydrazone 12 , imine 16,22 and squaraine 24 linkages have been developed for the solvothermal synthesis of COFs. Especially, covalent triazine frameworks synthesized by the trimerization of nitrile units under ionothermal conditions in the presence of molten salt such as ZnCl 2 [30][31][32][33][34] or by microwave reaction 35 offer a molecular platform to construct carbon nitrideconjugated networks, which exhibit outstanding properties and functions.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nExploration of new linkage and new reaction for the synthesis of COFs is a key to achieve the further advancement of functional porous materials.By virtue of their three-dimensional orderings at the atomic scale, 2D COFs have shown a great potential to perform core functions in organic electronics such as light emission 9,10 , charge transfer and separation 23,27 , and semiconduction 9,10,17,[19][20][21]23,26,28,29 . However, typical COFs lack intrasheet p-conjugation and chemical stability, which significantly limit their practical utility. To address this shortcoming, a chemically stable yet fully pconjugated COF is highly desirable. Such a framework with threedimensionally ordered chain alignment may provide a solution for the long-standing daunting challenges in semiconducting polymer technology [36][37][38] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOur COFs introduce a new strategy and direction in the quest for high-performance-conjugated polymers and may pave a way for innovations and applications in fields from organic electronics to energy storage, and fuel cells.\nResultsSynthesis and characterization. Figure 1 shows the structure of a chemically stable, electronically p-conjugated COF (CS-COF; CS stands for conjugated and stable). We selected C 3 -symmetric triphenylene hexamine (TPHA) 57 and C 2 -symmetric tertbutylpyrene tetraone (PT) 58 as building blocks for the topological ring fusion reaction and prepared the crystalline phenazine-linked CS-COF in isolated yields of 86-90% under solvothermal conditions. The tert-butyl side groups in PT were employed for enhancing the solubility of monomer. As an amorphous analogue, phenazine-linked-CMP Aza-CMPs that were synthesized using ionothermal conditions in the presence of AlCl 3 as a molten salt at 300-500 \u00b0C have been explored for supercapacitive energy storage 50 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDynamic covalent self-assembly of mechanically interlocked molecules solely made from peptides\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHVSchro \u00a8der\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYZhang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJLink\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/s41557-021-00770-7\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

Both hexamer and tetramer were detected in solution using silver(I) template, 52,53 whereas only hexamer was formed with copper(I) metal ions. 54 We envisage that this helicate provides an orderly hexagonal entanglement arrangement required for the formation of a Star of David catenane, the suitable alteration of this CHIRAGEN ligand would deliver the construction of the only L-enantiomer of a 6 2 1 link.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHighly stereoselective self-assembly of hexameric circular helicate The ligand frame consists of two pinene-2,2 0 -bipyridine units connected through a xylene bridge. Molecular modeling suggested that a five-atom chain attached to the 4-position of the pinene-bipyridine moiety, i.e., 1, should provide the suitable orientation and positioning to promote joining of the ligand strands with desired connectivity (Figure 1B).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSynthesis of interlocked 56-membered rings by dynamic selftemplating\n\t\t\n\t\t\tM.-KChung\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPSWhite\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSJLee\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00b4Gagne\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMR\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/anie.200903478\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAngew.

A conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process: we call this approach reticular synthesis. This chemistry has yielded materials designed to have predetermined structures, compositions and properties. In particular, highly porous frameworks held together by strong metal-oxygen-carbon bonds and with exceptionally large surface area and capacity for gas storage have been prepared and their pore metrics systematically varied and functionalized. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt is different from retrosynthesis of organic compounds 10 , because the structural integrity and rigidity of the building blocks in reticular synthesis remain unaltered throughout the construction process-an important aspect that could help to realize fully the benefits of design in crystalline solid-state frameworks. Similarly, reticular synthesis should be distinguished from supramolecular assembly 11 , because in the former, building blocks are linked by strong bonds throughout the crystal.In this context, it is worth noting that a plethora of extended structures successfully prepared by copolymerization of metal ions with organic links have been reported and reviewed under the rubric of 'crystal engineering', a term which has mutated somewhat over the years and which is now rather broadly defined [12][13][14] . We use the more precise term reticular synthesis (or chemistry) to describe the logical approach to the synthesis of robust materials with predesigned building blocks, extended structures, and properties. Thus, it might be considered a subclass of crystal engineering.Research in the area of MOFs and, to a lesser extent, inorganic frameworks, has recently progressed far enough to provide examples which show the feasibility of the building-block approach and the scope of reticular synthesis.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA lthough the synthesis of new materials has long been recognized as the most essential element in advancing technology, it generally remains more of an art than a science-in that the discovery of new compounds has mostly been serendipitous, using methods referred to by critics as 'shake and bake', 'mix and wait' and 'heat and beat'. For much of the twentieth century, this worked well for the synthesis of important solid-state materials, and we expect that it will continue to yield interesting compounds. However, it is becoming increasingly urgent to produce materials designed to perform highly specific and cooperative functions 1,2 .Recent extensive research into the design and synthesis of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) has led to numerous practical and conceptual developments in that direction [3][4][5][6][7] . Specifically, the chemistry of MOFs has provided an extensive class of crystalline materials with high stability, tunable metrics, organic functionality, and porosity. Here we present some of the important developments that have shaped this rapidly growing field and propose a general conceptual framework, which serves as a useful tool in designing materials constructed from molecular building blocks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHere we take selected examples to highlight the ideas involved, with emphasis on our own work on MOFs in which structural and thermal stability characterization have been combined with in-depth studies of surface area and gas sorption capacities. The subject of metal-organic frameworks has a long history, however, so we begin by giving some perspectives on the field.\nPerspectives and challengesThe Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) documents the crystal structures of more than 11,000 extended metal-organic compounds in which a metal ion or cluster has been linked by an organic moiety in which the linking functionality is a cyanide, pyridyl, phosphate or carboxylate. Of these, nearly 3,000 compounds have threedimensional (3D) structures and about double that number have 2D structures. MOFs composed of the first-row transition metals and organic links such as cyanide 15,16 , glutamate 17 , formate 18 , triazole 19 , oxalate 20 , 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylates 21 and squarates 22 have long been known.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Treatment with various drugs, including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (OXPHOS) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a two-tiered approach combining anti-cancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis concept is gaining prominence in the field of cancer research, with several studies reporting the enrichment of quiescent cancer stem cells after chemotherapy. For example, slow-cycling glioblastoma cells survive temozolomide treatment (Chen et al., 2012). Accordingly, if cell subpopulations can act as major drivers for tumor maintenance and mediate universal therapeutic resistance, approaches that target this phenotype could increase the efficacy of treatment regimens and reduce the risk of melanoma relapses.We have recently demonstrated that, even within highly proliferative melanomas, there is a slow-cycling cell subpopulation that is identifiable by the expression of the histone 3 K4 demethylase JARID1B (Roesch et al., 2005(Roesch et al., , 2010)).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nJARID1B (KDM5B/ PLU-1/RBP2-H1) is a member of the highly conserved family of jumonji/ARID1 H3K4 demethylases, which are involved in tissue development, cancer, and stem cell biology (Christensen et al., 2007;Dey et al., 2008;Yamane et al., 2007). The JARID1B high slow-cycling subpopulation is required for the continuous tumor growth of melanoma; however, it does not follow a unidirectional cancer stem cell hierarchy. The JARID1B high phenotype is temporarily distinct, dynamic, and can be acquired depending on the microenvironmental context (Roesch et al., 2010). In this respect, another study indicates that other types of cancers, such as breast or lung cancer, also harbor populations of quiescent cells that are drug resistant and whose phenotypes can switch dynamically (Sharma et al., 2010).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn line with the concept of dynamic phenotype switching (Roesch et al., 2010), drugresistant cells that are enriched for JARID1B can regain the original cell distribution and J/EGFP ratios after drug removal. Moreover, cisplatin-surviving JARID1B-enriched cells gave rise to fewer but significantly larger (i.e., rapidly growing) threedimensional (3D) colonies in soft agar compared to untreated cells (Figure 4C). This observation is reminiscent of earlier clonogenicity and single-cell dilution assays showing that untreated FACS-isolated J/EGFP high cells give rise to a rapidly proliferating progeny with elevated repopulation capacity when compared to JARID1B low cells (Roesch et al., 2010).\nBioenergetic Metabolism Plays an Important Role in the Survival of Slow-Cycling Melanoma CellsWe next designed experiments to unravel druggable targets that are specifically activated in slow-cycling melanoma cells.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics, and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains.

These studies provide genetic evidence that lineage-determining transcription factors are dependent on collaborative binding to variably spaced DNA recognition motifs in order to select enhancers and enable binding of signaldependent transcription factors. Notably, the variable motif distances observed at co-bound LDTF loci suggests that collaborative binding does not generally require direct proteinprotein interactions between the involved transcription factors. The proposed hierarchical LDTF collaborative model provides a conceptual framework for prioritization of non-coding disease-associated regulatory variants. While all cells express hundreds of transcription factors, a large fraction of functional enhancers (~70% in macrophages) are characterized by collaborative interactions involving relatively small sets of lineage determining transcription factors (e.g., PU.1, AP-1 and C/EBPs). The requirement for collaborative binding interactions provides an explanation for why transcription factor binding is lost at sites where mutations do not occur in the cognate recognition motif.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPrioritization of functional intergenic variants remains challenging due in part to an incomplete understanding of how regulation is achieved at the nucleotide level in different cell types and environmental contexts [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] . While recent studies have described important roles for lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs), also referred to as pioneer factors or master regulators, in selecting cell type-specific enhancers [12][13][14][15] , the sequence determinants that guide their binding are poorly understood. Previous findings in macrophages and B cells suggest a hierarchical model of regulatory function 6 , where a relatively small set of LDTFs collaboratively compete with nucleosomes to bind DNA in a cell type-specific manner (Fig 1a, i->ii). The binding of these factors is proposed to 'prime' DNA by initiating deposition of histone modifications that are associated with cis-active regulatory regions (Fig. 1a, ii -> iii) and enable concurrent or subsequent binding of signal-dependent transcription factors that direct regulated gene expression (Fig. 1a, iii ->iv) 6,13,15,16 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHere, we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineagedetermining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics, and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains.

But their ultra-short lifetime, typically 100 fs or less, and correspondingly short transport length-scale in the nanometre range constrain real-space investigations. Here we report variable temperature and voltage measurements of the nonlocal manipulation of adsorbed molecules on the Si(111)-7 \u00d7 7 surface in the scanning tunnelling microscope. The range of the nonlocal effect increases with temperature and, at constant temperature, is invariant over a wide range of electron energies.

We inject at currents of B100 pA and therefore have, on average, one-electron injected every 1 ns. Given the 180 fs lifetime of the electrons within the 2.0 eV state, we rule out carrier-carrier scattering. Further carrier-phonon scattering brings the mean energy of the electron distribution down to ultimately thermalize with the lattice. In our case, this carrierphonon scattering appears to occur within the high-lying 2.0 eV state since we have a temperature dependence of the nonlocal range. Subsequent scattering, here in a time of 180 fs, removes the electron from this state to lower lying states. There is therefore a competition between electron-phonon scattering thermalizing the hot-electron within the 2.0 eV state and scattering that electron into a lower lying state.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe range of the nonlocal effect increases with temperature and, at constant temperature, is invariant over a wide range of electron energies.

They are predicted to exist in a vortex core of superconducting topological insulators. However, it is extremely difficult to distinguish them experimentally from other quasiparticle states for the tiny energy difference between Majorana fermions and these states, which is beyond the energy resolution of most available techniques. Here, we circumvent the problem by systematically investigating the spatial profile of the Majorana mode and the bound quasiparticle states within a vortex in Bi(2)Te(3) films grown on a superconductor NbSe(2). While the zero bias peak in local conductance splits right off the vortex center in conventional superconductors, it splits off at a finite distance \u223c20 nm away from the vortex center in Bi(2)Te(3). This unusual splitting behavior has never been observed before and could be possibly due to the Majorana fermion zero mode. While the Majorana mode is destroyed by the interaction between vortices, the zero bias peak splits as a conventional superconductor again. This work provides self-consistent evidences of Majorana fermions and also suggests a possible route to manipulating them. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTheoretical studies later showed that the MFs may also reside at two ends of a semiconductor nanowire (NW) with strong spin-orbit coupling when it is contacted to an s-wave SC in a proper external magnetic field 9 . Several transport measurements revealed a signature of MFs, i.e., a sharp zero-bias peak in differential conductance spectrum, in various NW/SC junctions [10][11][12][13] . In InSb/Nb junction, an unconventional fractional a.c. Josephson effect was observed and attributed to the existence of MFs 14 . However, alternative explanations of these transport results based on disorder and/or band bending in the NWs have been proposed [15][16][17][18] . As yet, no conclusive evidence has been established for the existence of MF.In contrary, the disorder alone is unlikely to induce a zero-bias peak in a TI/SC heterostructure, which can be used to detect MFs without complications mentioned above.Proximity effect induced superconductivity in a TI surface has been demonstrated in several TI/SC heterostructures [19][20][21][22] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnomalous Zero-Bias Conductance Peak in a Nb -InSb Nanowire -Nb Hybrid Device\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMTDeng\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1021/nl303758w\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNano Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t6414\n\t\t\t2012\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tZero-bias peaks and splitting in an Al-InAs nanowire topological superconductor as a signature of Majorana fermions\n\t\t\n\t\t\tADas\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/nphys2479\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat.

Key uncertainties in kilonova modeling include the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products\u2014non-thermal beta-particles, alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays\u2014and the efficiency with which their kinetic energy is absorbed by the ejecta. The radioactive energy emitted, along with its thermalization efficiency, sets the luminosity budget and is therefore crucial for predicting kilonova light curves. We outline uncertainties in the radioactivity, describe the processes by which the decay products transfer energy to the ejecta, and calculate time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We determine the net thermalization efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process yields\u2014in particular, the production of \n-decaying translead nuclei\u2014and on ejecta mass, velocity, and magnetic fields. We incorporate our results into detailed radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated kilonova light curve predictions. Thermalization effects reduce kilonova luminosities by a factor of roughly 2 at peak, and by an order of magnitude at later times (15 days or more after explosion). We present analytic fits to time-dependent thermalization efficiencies, which can be used to improve light curve models. We revisit the putative kilonova that accompanied gamma-ray burst 130603B, and estimate the mass ejected in that event. We find later time kilonova light curves can be significantly impacted by alpha-decay from translead isotopes; data at these times may therefore be diagnostic of ejecta abundances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor our fiducial model, the predicted luminosity is lower by a factor of \uf0882 at peak, and by 10 days is lower by an factor of 5.18.

These studies unveiled that Cu and ZnO agglomerate and ZnO particles flatten under CO/H2 and/or CO2 /H2 . Under the optimal CO/CO2 /H2 mixture, sintering is prevented and ZnO crystals adopt an elongated shape due to the minimal presence of the H2 O byproduct, enhancing the water-gas shift activity and thus the methanol production.

They claimed, based on an array of different MOFs in comparison with alumina, their industrial adsorbent of choice for dehumidification, that all MOFs have superior total capacities, and some also display superior breakthrough behavior, and thus faster kinetics. 454 In addition, cyclic regeneration for MOFs can be achieved with significantly less energy (lower T des ), all in line with preceding findings (desiccant, AHP/AC). 454  The potential of MOFs as adsorbents in adsorption-driven allocation of heat and cold has been thoroughly assessed in this Review. The adsorption mechanism of water on MOFs is known. Water initially adsorbs at specific hydrophilic sites (uncoordinated metal sites, OH-groups on inorganic clusters, or functional groups on the organic ligand). Subsequently, additional water clusters around these initially adsorbed water molecules, after which the pores are filled via volume filling (d p < D c ) or capillary condensation (d p > D c ). In silico prediction of water adsorption in MOFs is deemed not yet mature enough for accurate selection of MOF structures.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSo, larger pore sizes could be used for MOF-alcohol pairs than for water, and for alcohols focus should be on exploring adsorption on additional MOF structures, especially comprising larger pore size structures to obtain more efficient alcohol-based working pairs. 8.2.3. Water -Stages 3/4. In section 6 of this Review, it has been demonstrated convincingly that water-MOF working pairs exist with higher capacity and thermodynamic efficiency than benchmark sorbents. Shaping of these materials should be focused on, in conjunction with, measurements on heat and mass transfer dynamics. For packed bed systems, heat transfer is often limiting, making coatings an optimal configuration. 51,418,455 Most work regarding MOF coatings has focused on the creation of thin films, [456][457][458][459][460][461] of which the thickness is generally on the submicrometer-scale, orders of magnitude off for target application. However, there are studies focusing on creating thick MOF films (>100 \u03bcm), suited for application. These are based on direct crystallization on the surface, without the need for a physical binder material.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n101 The main findings from the literature will be discussed individually. For water (Table 1), tri-and tetravalent MOFs are subdivided into existing cluster configurations and discussed first, followed by bivalent zeolite-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and pillared MOFs and the presumably less stable remaining bivalent Znand Cu-based MOFs, whereafter a set of miscellaneous structures is listed.

[3] In spite of versatile advantages of porous MOFs, which include tailor-made pore structures and controllable porosity by change of organic ligands and metal subunits, [2] most MOFs suffer from a lack of hydrothermal stability. [4] Structural damage to a MOF caused by moisture at processing conditions or during regeneration will strongly limit the utilization of a MOF as a sorbent for industrial applications. [4] Conversely, highly porous MOFs with good hydrothermal stability represent candidates for industrially useful water sorbents.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCubic mesoporous metal(III) di-or tri-carboxylates with hierachical pore structures labeled MIL-101(Cr), MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr), and MIL-100(Al) (MIL stands for Materials of Institut Lavoisier) using trivalent octahedral metals and the simplest aromatic carboxylates such as terepthalate and trimesate have been discovered. [5,6] Based on this requirement, the exceptional hydrothermal stability and large sorption uptakes known for MIL-101 and MIL-100 encouraged us to assess their applicability for water sorption applications. [5,6] Despite studies done on water adsorption in MOFs, [7] reports dealing with MOFs as water adsorbents are still scarce [8] and there is a particular need to evaluate their low temperature desorption properties, i.e., below 80 \u00b0C for application to energy-efficient dehumidication systems.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis suggests that most of the water molecules are physisorbed on MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe) with a low host-guest interaction (close to the energy of liquefaction) except for the coordinated water molecules, allowing for the low-temperature desorption of water.  designed for a prototype simulation of a household desiccanttype dehumidifier than that with a zeolite rotor, which is commercially available. The detailed results will be published elsewhere.In conclusion, we have unambiguously demonstrated that hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks, MIL-100 and MIL-101 with mesoporous cages behave as advanced water adsorbents applicable to energy-efficient dehumidification. Elaborate investigations of their water sorption properties have shown huge sorption uptakes even at 40 \u00b0C as well as high desorption rates below 80 \u00b0C together with hydrothermal stability. In comparison with the water sorption behaviors of commercial adsorbents such as zeolite NaX, SAPO-34, and silica gel, the improved performance in MIL-100 and MIL-101 demonstrated here suggests commercially viable applications including energyefficient desiccant dehumidification and fresh water production.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

S7), in line with previous findings of a positive correlation between the dendritic spine density of memory engram cells and memory expression triggered by natural recall cues [citation 25].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Labelling and optical erasure of synaptic memory traces in the motor cortex \nAbstract: Dendritic spines are the major loci of synaptic plasticity and are considered as possible structural correlates of memory. Nonetheless, systematic manipulation of specific subsets of spines in the cortex has been unattainable, and thus, the link between spines and memory has been correlational. We developed a novel synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n5c-n). Contrary to the dual task group, spines potentiated during the 1st rotarod training were more likely to be repotentiated after the 2nd rotarod training in the re-training group (green, Fig. l,n), while re-potentiation was significantly less prominent in mice that did not perform the retraining task (home cage group) (Fig. 5i-k, l, n; Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Furthermore, newly potentiated spines, which were not potentiated in the first 2 days, were less abundant in the re-training and home cage groups compared with the dual task group (yellow, Fig. 5m,n). These findings suggest that reorganisation of distinct synaptic ensembles is specific for each learning task.\nDiscussionCurrent models of learning and memory suggest that structural plasticity of spines is the underlying mechanism of information storage in the brain. Nonetheless, clear visualization of spine structure in vivo requires the sparse labelling of neurons, and analysis of structural changes in spines is considerably laborious.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe minimal number of learning-evoked spines illuminated by the optical fibre was roughly 410,000 spines in the bilateral M1 cortex based on the following calculation: (d) \u00d7 (f) \u00d7 (g) \u00d7 (h), in which (f) represents the density of excitatory synapses in the mouse neocortex, 6.4 \u00d7 10 8 /mm 3 (ref 38); (g) learning-evoked potentiation, approximately 2% of the spines in this area (Extended Data Fig. 4); (h) brain volume that received PA: 0.4 mm 2 of PA area \u00d7 0.1 mm of depth = 0.04 mm 3 ). In the layer I, corticocortical feedback projections mediating top-down influences are concentrated, which strongly excite a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons 39 . Learning-evoked changes in neuronal ensembles via the synaptic reorganisation of the M1 cortex directly predict future task performance 40 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n4d).To characterize the synaptic retention of AS-PaRac1 for photoactivation (PA) experiments in vivo, the individual spines that acquired AS-PaRac1 were tracked, and were separately iconized from the day of AS-PaRac1 appearance (Fig. 2c andi). We noticed that persistence of synaptic AS-PaRac1 and the structural potentiation markedly varied among spines: some were preserved beyond 1 day after training (Fig. 2c, dendrite #1), while others disappeared (Fig. 2c, dendrites #2 and #3). Importantly, the structural potentiation and AS-PaRac1 labelling triggered during the 'Learning' period were more likely to be preserved than those triggered during the training-free period (Fig. 2j, 'Before' and 'After-1'). Consistently, longitudinal imaging of the structurally potentiated spines revealed that the majority of those with the retention of AS-PaRac1 for 24 h maintained structural potentiation for at least 48 h (Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We herein show ionic liquid-derived mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon to be a highly active, cheap, and selective metal-free catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide with the potential to establish a safe, sustainable, and cheap flow-reactor-based production method.With the synthesis of novel mesoporous metal-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in hydrogen fuel cells with activities in basic media comparable to those of commercial platinum catalysts, we and others could recently endorse the thesis of highly ORR-active nitrogen-doped carbon. 13,14 However, our nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts also possess considerably high catalytic activity in the acidic media of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). 13 Mechanistic analysis of the electrochemical process showed that the number of transferred electrons was not always four, as theoretically expected for the complete reduction of O 2 to H 2 O; in some cases, lower, uneven values were calculated.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n23,24 In conclusion, we have shown that conductive nitrogendoped carbon is applicable as an efficient, metal-free catalyst for the selective, green, and cheap electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide. Besides being easy and cheap, the catalyst synthesis is flexible enough to allow further optimization of the porosity and surface area.To date, the true dependence of the structure on the reactivity remains unclear, and further investigations are needed. However, as a comparable material synthesized at higher temperatures (1000 \u00b0C) supports the four-electron process, certain assumptions can be made: (1) Consistent with simulations of Okamoto, 22 an increased nitrogen content may favor the two-electron process. (2) The \"radical\" character of nitrogen-bound carbon, which is essential for the two-electron process, 21 may be more pronounced for meso-BMP-800 because of the lower degree of delocalization.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAdditionally, the method is very inexpensive (regarding electricity 2.4 EUR cents kg H 2 O 2 -1 at 10 EUR cents kWh -1 industry price), while costs for the transport of liquid hazardous H 2 O 2 could be avoided. As such, precise attribution of the catalytic activity to a specific binding site seems rather speculative. Besides the importance of an increased nitrogen content retaining sufficient conductivity (see ref 22), another possible factor affecting the reactivity is the degree of graphitization. Here, the polarizability of the graphitic layers should influence the adsorption properties, while the elongation of the conjugated \u03c0 system could determine crucial electronic properties. As the radical character of nitrogen-bound carbon may support the two-electron process, less-conjugated \u03c0 systems should be more favored for hydrogen peroxide synthesis. 21 However, nitrogen-doped carbon materials have also received great attention as support materials for metal and metal alloy catalysts, for example, in the methanol oxidation reaction or oxygen reduction to water.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

NaChBac inactivation kinetics show strong, bell-shaped voltage dependence with characteristic time constants ranging from approximately 50 ms at depolarized voltages to a maximum of approximately 100 s at the inactivation midpoint. Activation and inactivation parameters for four different covalently linked tandem dimer or tandem tetramer constructs were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type channel. Point mutations in the outer part of the pore revealed an important influence of the S195 residue on the process of inactivation. For two mutants (S195D and S195E), the maximal and minimal rates of inactivation observed were increased by approximately 2.5-fold, and the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, compared to the wild-type channel. Our data suggest that pore vestibule structure is an important determinant of NaChBac inactivation, whereas the inactivation mechanism is independent of the number of free cytoplasmic N- and C-termini in the functional channel. In these respects, NaChBac inactivation resembles C-type or slow inactivation modes observed in other voltage-gated K and Na channels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA similar mechanism has been described for Na channels. In this case channel block is probably provided by the III-IV interdomain linker latched by a triplet of hydrophobic residues (IFM motif) to form a hinged lid (8).A second type of inactivation process, usually with significantly slower kinetics, has been observed in a number of channels (9)(10)(11). This type of inactivation is called C-type or slow inactivation, with yet a third inactivation process (P-type) also recognized in potassium channels (12). Although the detailed mechanisms of slow inactivation processes are incompletely understood, it is believed that rearrangement of the pore, rather than motion of a cytoplasmic region of the channel, is likely to play a central role (13)(14)(15).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe importance of better understanding of slow inactivation in sodium voltage-gated channels is evident since its alteration is linked to such clinical disorders as periodic paralysis, myotonia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and long-QT syndrome, as recently reviewed by Vilin and Ruben (16).The prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel (NaCh-Bac) shows homology with eukaryotic voltage-gated channels though its sequence shows closer similarity with calcium channels than with sodium channels (17). NaChBac activates in response to membrane depolarization and then enters an inactivated state (18). It is likely that activation in NaChBac occurs through similar mechanisms as in voltagegated eukaryotic channels, based on the fact that the structure of NaChBac contains a highly charged, S4 transmembrane (TM) segment in a six-TM-segment domain (Fig. 1), which is homologous to the voltage sensor of eukaryotic channels (19). Nonetheless, the mechanism of NaChBac inactivation is not well understood.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nINTRODUCTIONOne of the common properties of voltage-gated channels is their ability to inactivate in response to membrane depolarization. Two general mechanisms of inactivation have been characterized. The first mechanism is usually typified by relatively fast inactivation during a sustained depolarization, effected at the molecular level by a ''ball and chain'' (1)(2)(3)(4)(5) or ''hinged-lid'' mechanism (6). Molecular mechanisms of this type of inactivation, called N-type inactivation, have been studied in detail in K and Na channels. The groups responsible for this type of inactivation are localized at the cytoplasmic side of the channel. For example, in Shaker K-channel, the N-terminal region of the channel plays the role of the ''ball'', which occludes the inner part of the pore after channel activation and thus closes the channel (7). A similar mechanism has been described for Na channels.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

ZnO nanorods were grown on the ZnO seed layer from solution, and their diameters and lengths were controlled by precursor concentration and growth time. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite infiltrated ZnO nanorods showed a power conversion efficiency of 11.13% with short-circuit current density Jsc of 20.08 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage Voc of 991 mV and fill factor of 0.56. Square spectral feature of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was observed, where EQE exceeded 80% in almost the entire wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, and the integrated current density of 20.03 mA/cm2 calculated from EQE data was in good agreement with the observed Jsc. Compared to the perfect spectral response of ZnO nanorods, a perovskite solar cell based on TiO2 nanorods exhibited an integrated current density (16 mA/cm2) much lower than the measured Jsc (20.9 mA/cm2). In addition, time-limited photocurrent response under 530 and 700 nm monochromatic beams at 10 Hz showed that device signal amplitude, associated with charge collection, was rapidly saturated for the ZnO nanorod-based device whereas charge collection was not fully detected for the TiO2 nanorod-based device because of slow collection rate. The current results suggest that ZnO nanorod is an effective charge collection system in CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n4 Recent progress pushed PCE of perovskite solar cell up to 15%. 5,6 Thanks to the high open-circuit voltage V oc of perovskite solar cell exceeding 1 V, a PCE of 20% is predicted from perovskite solar cell, 7,8 which indicates that organometal halide perovskite is a very promising solar cell material.There are two branches in developing perovskite solar cell; one is based on electron-injecting nanostructured oxide layer, and the other is based on nonelectron-injecting scaffold layer (meso-superstructure) or pn junction type planar structure. For the case of the electron-injecting oxide system, except for the TiO 2 nanoparticles, one-dimensional TiO 2 [9][10][11] and ZnO 12,13 were investigated. Although electron transport in ZnO was observed to be faster than that in TiO 2 , 13 photovoltaic performances of ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells were inferior to those of TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cells.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2 However, the perovskite light harvester suffers from liquid-type dye-sensitized solar cell because it tends to easily dissolve in the polar liquid electrolyte. This problem has been solved by replacing the liquid electrolyte with solid hole conductor. Allsolid-state solar cell comprising CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 nanodots deposited on TiO 2 surface demonstrated a PCE of 9.7%, along with excellent long-term stability. 3 It was also confirmed that the perovskite solar cell could work well even without a mesoporous TiO 2 film, where a thin, continuous CH 3 NH 3 PbI 2 Cl layer formed on the Al 2 O 3 surface showed a PCE of 10.9%. 4 Recent progress pushed PCE of perovskite solar cell up to 15%.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTwo-step spin coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in the 1 \u03bcm long TiO 2 nanorod film results in J sc of 20.92 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 869 mV, FF of 0.55, and PCE of 10.02%, which is higher than the previous result for the similar TiO 2 length 9 because of the different coating procedure for the perovskite as mentioned previously. Compared to the ZnO  nanorod, the slightly lower PCE is due to lower V oc , associated with lower conduction band position for the rutile TiO 2 structure and/or enhanced recombination. It is also noted that absolute EQE is lower in spite of high J sc , and as a result, the integrated J sc of about 16 mA/cm 2 is far lower than the measured J sc at 1 sun illumination. In addition, APCE in Figure 9d is lower than that of ZnO (Figure 7d) in spite of similar LHE in Figure 9c.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We report that single iron sites embedded in a silica matrix enable direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane, exclusively to ethylene and aromatics. The reaction is initiated by catalytic generation of methyl radicals, followed by a series of gas-phase reactions. The absence of adjacent iron sites prevents catalytic C-C coupling, further oligomerization, and hence, coke deposition. At 1363 kelvin, methane conversion reached a maximum at 48.1% and ethylene selectivity peaked at 48.4%, whereas the total hydrocarbon selectivity exceeded 99%, representing an atom-economical transformation process of methane. The lattice-confined single iron sites delivered stable performance, with no deactivation observed during a 60-hour test. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nT he challenge of converting natural gas into transportable fuels and chemicals (1) has been spurred by several emerging industrial trends, including rapidly rising demand for H 2 (for upgrading lower-quality oils) and a global shortage of aromatics caused by shifting refinery targets toward gasoline. Light olefins, which are key chemical feedstocks, are currently made from methanol, which itself is made through multistage catalytic transformations via syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) (2,3), although there is also ongoing research to convert syngas directly to light olefins (4,5). However, in all such approaches, either CO or H 2 is needed to remove oxygen from CO, resulting in a carbon-atom utilization efficiency below 50%. Despite their low efficiency, high capital and production costs, and enormous CO 2 emissions, syngas routes dominate current and near-term industrial practices for natural gas conversion (6, 7).Direct conversion of CH 4 is potentially more economical and environmentally friendly but is challenging because CH 4 exhibits high C-H bond strength (434 kJ/mol), negligible electron affinity, large ionization energy, and low polarizability (8).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCommercial prospects for this process are further hampered by the instability of zeolites at the very high reaction temperatures.To achieve direct conversion of CH 4 efficiently, the challenges lie in cleaving the first C-H bond while suppressing further catalytic dehydrogenation, avoiding both CO 2 generation and coke deposition. We report that these conditions can be met using lattice-confined single iron sites embedded in a silica matrix. These sites activate CH 4 in the absence of oxidants, generating methyl radicals, which desorb from the catalyst surface and then undergo a series of gas-phase reactions to yield ethylene, benzene, and naphthalene as the only products (with ethylene dominating at short space-times for a selectivity of ~52.7% at 1293 K). A methane conversion as high as 48.1% is achieved at 1363 K.The catalysts were obtained by fusing ferrous metasilicate with SiO 2 at 1973 K in air and from commercial quartz, followed by leaching with aqueous HNO 3 and drying at 353 K (22).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSlow progress in discovering new catalysts to circumvent this problem has hindered further development, and no economically viable process has been put into practice so far.In a recent report, elemental sulfur was used as a softer oxidant than O 2 (14): For a 5% CH 4 /Ar mixture at 1323 K, the best catalyst, PdS/ZrO 2 , gave a CH 4 conversion of ~16% and ethylene selectivity near 20%, albeit at the expense of the by-products CS 2 and H 2 S (14). In contrast, the bifunctional catalysts based on Mo/zeolites catalyze CH 4 conversion to aromatics (benzene and naphthalene) nonoxidatively, thereby avoiding CO 2 formation (15)(16)(17)(18). CH 4 is activated on the metal sites forming CH x species, which dimerize to C 2 H y . Subsequent oligomerization on the acidic sites located inside the zeolite pores yields benzene and naphthalene, as well as copious amounts of coke (19)(20)(21).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread pathogen responsible for generally asymptomatic and persistent infections in healthy people. Recent evidence indicates that HCMV gene products are expressed in over 90% of malignant type glioblastomas (GBM). In addition, the HCMV Immediate Early-1 protein (IE1) is expressed in >90% of tumors analyzed.\nMethods: RhoA, RhoB and RhoC were individually depleted in U373MG glioblastoma cells as well as U373MG cells stably expressing the HCMV IE1 protein (named U373MG-IE1 cells) shRNA lentivirus vectors. Cell proliferation assays, migration as well as wound-healing assays were performed in uninfected and HCMV-infected cells.\nResults: The depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC protein resulted in significant alterations in the morphology of the uninfected cells, which were further enhanced by the cytopathic effect caused by HCMV. Furthermore, in the absence or presence of HCMV, the knockdown of RhoB and RhoC proteins decreased the proliferation rate of the parental and the IE1-expressing glioblastoma cells, whereas the knockdown of RhoA protein in the HCMV infected cell lines restored their proliferation rate. In addition, wound healing assays in U373MG cells revealed that depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC differentially reduced their migration rate, even in the presence or the absence of HCMV.\nConclusion: Collectively, these data show for the first time a differential implication of Rho GTPases in morphology, proliferation rate and motility of human glioblastoma cells during HCMV infection, further supporting an oncomodulatory role of HCMV depending on the Rho isoforms' state. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nConclusion: Collectively, these data show for the first time a differential implication of Rho GTPases in morphology, proliferation rate and motility of human glioblastoma cells during HCMV infection, further supporting an oncomodulatory role of HCMV depending on the Rho isoforms' state.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIntroductionThe Rho GTPase family, a relative of Ras proto-oncogenes, consists of more than 20 proteins in humans, devided into subfamilies including Rho, Rac, Cdc42, RhoH, RhoBTB, Rho, Rnd and Rif (Rif and RhoD) [1]. Rho GTPases have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes and most importantly of cytoskeleton organization and its impact on biological functions on cellular movement and division [2,3]. Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA are the far wellcharacterized members of the superfamily. In addition, recent studies have shown that Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA have a modulatory role in cellular trafficking and tumorigenesis [4].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe above observations are consistent with earlier studies depleting the same Rho isoforms both in prostate and breast cancer cells [59,62]. The overexpression of HCMV IE1 protein alone did not bring about any additional effect regarding the phenotype of the Rho knockdown cells, thus excluding any direct modulatory role of IE1 on cell morphology. The morphological changes induced in the glioblastoma cells after RhoA and RhoC depletion remained evident, even in the context of HCMV infection, despite the cytopathic effect caused by the virus, highlighting an imposing role Rho GTPases on cell shape. Although Rho GTPases have been shown to enhance malignant transformation and proliferation rate, RhoB is rather assumed as a negative regulator of these processes [63,64]. However, recent data have shown that RhoB expression is induced under conditions such as DNA damage, or treatment with growth factors or cytokines, suggesting that under particular circumstances, RhoB may favor towards human malignancy, including glioblastoma tumors [65,66].\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFurthermore, RhoA is important for both amoeboid and mesenchymal migration through the activation of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway [13]. On the other hand, RhoC limits to metastasis in cancer progression [14]. Studies of RhoC deficient mice show that RhoC is required for metastasis but not for the tumour initiation [14]. Besides, the expression of RhoB has been associated with tumor aggressiveness while it is often downregulated in human tumours [15]. RhoB has been proposed to act as a tumour suppressor inhibiting tumour growth, cell migration and invasion [15]. RhoB deficient mice have a normal developmental profile but display oncogenic formation [16].Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family of Human Herpesviruses. It is a beta herpes virus that establishes a lifelong latent infection after a primary infection [17]. HCMV has the largest genome among all herpes viruses, approximately 230 kbp that is divided into a unique large (UL) and unique short (US) region.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Research has mainly focused on increasing the crystallinity of conjugated polymers as a strategy to improve the long-range charge transport properties. Here, we demonstrate that local aggregation over very few chains is a sufficient mesoscopic structure to ensure high mobility, with charge transport mainly occurring along the polymer backbones, and that extended crystallinity is not necessary. These results provide an explanation for the high mobilities observed in seemingly disordered polymers and set molecular-design guidelines for next-generation conjugated polymers. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nResearch should be shifted to the molecular level with a focus on the interchain coupling in the aggregates and/or the design of molecules that afford delocalization and minimize trapping (38).\nMaterials and MethodsOFET Device Fabrication. Corning Eagle 2000 glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min each, following by drying with nitrogen. Source-drain electrodes patterns were fabricated using a conventional evaporation procedure through metal shadow mask (channel length 30 \u03bcm, channel width 500 \u03bcm). Five-nanometer-thick Ti was used as adhesion layer of the Au electrodes on glass. The semiconducting polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) (ActivInk N2200; Polyera Inc.) and PS (molecular weight 100 kDa; Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 1,2dichlorobenzene, both at the concentration of 8 mg/mL. P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS solutions were obtained by mixing the two above-mentioned solutions in volume ratios. Before film deposition, both polymer solutions were stirred for at least 2 h to allow complete dissolution of the samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis observation is confirmed by depth-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements which show the concentrations of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur [elements found in P(NDI2OD-T2)] to be enriched near the surface of the film (Fig. S4). Such vertical phase separation featuring a P(NDI2OD-T2)-rich top layer and a bottom interface primarily composed of PS is attributed to the different surface energies of P(NDI2OD-T2) and PS. Indeed, P(NDI2OD-T2) with a low surface energy (23.7 mJ\u2022m -2 ; ref. 23) tends to segregate at the air/film interface, whereas PS with higher surface energy (40.2 mJ\u2022m -2 ; ref. 27) prefers the SiO 2 surface. A similar surface-induced phase separation is typically reported for other semiconductor/insulator polymer blends (28)(29)(30). A characteristic single-phase morphology with randomly oriented crystalline grains on the order of 10-30 nm is observed in neat films of P(NDI2OD-T2) (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAfter the CYTOP deposition, the devices were annealed under nitrogen, on a hot plate, at 110 \u00b0C for 5 h. Finally, the devices were completed by evaporating a 70-nm-thick Al gate electrode through a metal shadow mask on top of the dielectric layers.Thin Film and OFET Device Characterization. Atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope IIIa AFM; Digital Instruments) was operated in tapping mode to characterize the surface morphologies. UV-absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY-5000; Varian). All of the OFET electrical characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS in air.XRD Measurements. All measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 11-3. The incident X-ray beam was set at a grazing incidence (0.12\u00b0), which was chosen to be above the critical angle of the polymer film but below that of the silicon substrate, ensuring that the full thickness of the film was sampled. Samples were kept in a helium-filled environment during the measurements.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe actual impossibility of cloning photons, shown below, thus prohibits superluminal communication by this scheme.

Let us suppose that such an amplification can in fact be accomplished for the vertical polarization It) and for the horizontal polarization 1-).

We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.Note that if photons could be cloned, a plausible argument could be made for the possibility of faster-than-light communication 2 \u2022 It is well known that for certain non-separably correlated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of photons, once an observer has made a polarization measurement (say, vertical versus horizontal) on one member of the pair, the other one, which may be far away, can be for all purposes of prediction regarded as having the same polarization 3\u2022 If this second photon could be replicated and its precise polarization measured as above, it would be possible to ascertain whether, for example, the first photon had been subjected to a measurement of linear or circular polarization. In this way the first observer would be able to transmit information faster than light by encoding his message into his choice of measurement.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n299 28 October 1982Milonni (unpublished work) has shown that the process of stimulated emission does not lead to quantum amplification, because if there is stimulated emission there must also be-with equal probability in the case of one incoming photon-spontaneous emission, and the polarization of a spontaneously emitted photon is entirely independent of the polarization of the original.It is conceivable that a more sophisticated amplifying apparatus could get around Milonni's argument. We have therefore presented the above simple argument, based on the linearity of quantum mechanics, to show that no apparatus, however complicated, can amplify an arbitrary polarization.We stress that the question of replicating individual photons is of practical interest. It is obviously closely related to the The study of supernovae is hampered by an insufficient knowledge of the initial stellar mass for individual supernova. Because of large uncertainties in estimating both the total mass of a remnant (including the pulsar or black hole) and any mass loss during the pre-supernova stages, the main sequence mass of the progenitor cannot be accurately determined from observations alone. To calculate an initial mass, one must rely on a combination of both theory and observation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We found that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, is a ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 23 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], high Curie temperature of 426 kelvin (above that of BTO), large dielectric constant, and low dielectric loss. DIPAB exhibits good piezoelectric response and well-defined ferroelectric domains. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to perovskite ferroelectrics and ferroelectric polymers in sensing, actuation, data storage, electro-optics, and molecular or flexible electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe piezoresponse is measured to be as high as 360 pm under only 1 V ac, comparable with most other ferroelectrics, thus confirming its excellent piezoelectricity. Lateral PFM overlaid on 3D topography shows phase (Fig. 4C) and amplitude (Fig. 4D) mappings in good correspondence with the vertical mappings, despite the out-of-plane polarization direction of the sample. This can be understood from the piezoelectric tensor d of a C 2 point group, with nonzero d 22 and d 25 and spontaneous polarization P 2 (29), which induces normal and shear piezoelectric strains simultaneously under an electric field applied along the polar axis, whereas for BTO and PZT with out-ofplane polarization, only normal response is expected from symmetry. In this sense, the terms vertical and lateral PFM are somewhat misleading, and it is more appropriate to describe the data in terms of normal and shear PFM. Switching PFM was also carried out, with dc voltage applied on top of the ac voltage to switch the polarization, resulting in characteristic hysteresis and butterfly loops (Fig. 4, E andF).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFerroelectricity was originally discovered in Rochelle salt (8) in 1921 and later in a few other molecular systems (9), but the rapid development of ferroelectrics took place only after the discovery of ferroelectricity in perovskite barium titanate (BTO) (10) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) (11). Relative to BTO and PZT, most  molecular ferroelectrics suffer from low spontaneous polarization (P s ), low melting temperature and phase transition temperature (Curie temperature, T c ), small dielectric constant, and weak piezoelectricity; their advantages include light weight, mechanical flexibility, and environmentally friendly processing as they are lead-free. Ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers (12) share some of the drawbacks of molecular ferroelectrics, which limits their applications. The recently reported croconic acid (6) has a high spontaneous polarization of around 23 mC cm -2 ; however, evidence for a ferroelectric phase transition, piezoelectric response, or ferroelectric domains has not been reported.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nS6), indicating paraelectric characteristics with leakage current (14). Just below T c , a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop emerges (Fig. 3A), confirming the ferroelectricity of a-DIPAB. The coercive field is estimated to be 5.0 kV cm -1 , smaller than those of PVDF (500 kV cm -1 ) (4), BTO (10 kV cm -1 ) (4), PZT (20 to 80 kV cm -1 ) (21), and DIPAC (9 kV cm -1 ) (13). The spontaneous polarization measured using a pyroelectric technique (Fig. 3B) reveals a very sharp transition from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric phase in an interval of about 3 K, indicating again a first-order phase transition. P s is measured to be 23 mC cm -2 , compared to 8 mC cm -2 for PVDF (4), 26 mC cm -2 for BTO (4), 30 to 55 mC cm -2 for PZT (21), and 8 mC cm -2 for DIPAC (13).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We designed and assembled multidimensional RNA structures and used them as scaffolds for the spatial organization of bacterial metabolism. Engineered RNA modules were assembled into discrete, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional scaffolds with distinct protein-docking sites and used to control the spatial organization of a hydrogen-producing pathway. We increased hydrogen output as a function of scaffold architecture. Rationally designed RNA assemblies can thus be used to construct functional architectures in vivo. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe ability to organize protein complexes and biological pathways spatially presents a strategy to engineer cells (3,4).The spatial organization of biomolecules has been the focus of DNA nanotechnology (5)(6)(7)(8). This approach utilizes DNA's base-pairing to generate one-, two-and threedimensional assemblies. DNA structures have largely remained limited to in vitro applications (9). RNA provides a compatible material for in vivo nucleic acid based construction (10). It can be produced via the transcription machinery, and forms stable interactions. RNA has been used to build higher-order assemblies in vitro (11,12) and can potentially be used in vivo to engineer the intracellular environment.Here, we engineered synthetic RNA modules that assemble into functional discrete, one-, and two-dimensional scaffolds in vivo, and used them to control the spatial organization of bound proteins (Fig. 1A).

These RNA strands possess dimerization (DD) and polymerization domains (PD). To prevent the formation of ill-defined networks, it was necessary to disfavor the collapse of the palindromic regions (15) and control assembly-order by insuring tile formation before polymerization. We achieved this by designing PDs that fold intramolecularly into kinetically protected hairpin structures (Fig. 1D, step i). The stem of these hairpins is an overlapping shared domain with DD that discourages collapse (Fig. 1D, red segments), allowing DD to \"activate\" PD upon self-binding (Fig. 1D, step iii). We further destabilized the collapsed-state by incorporating wobble-pairs and mispairs (figs. S1 to S4).The one-dimensional RNA assembly D1 was derived from a single RNA d1 with PP7 and MS2 binding domains (Fig. 1E).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The extraordinary mechanical properties exhibited by these materials are enabled by an integration of toughening mechanisms that maintain high elasticity and dissipate mechanical energy within the protein networks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[29] By simply controlling the concentrations of the proteins (CCP, MCP1, and MCP2) and the crosslinkers (THPC and Zn 2+ ), it is possible to synthesize extremely strong, tough, stretchable, and self-adhesive hydrogels (Figure 3A,B). As a control, we found that a crosslinked network containing only CCP (no MCP1/2 nor ZnSO 4 ) results in a hydrogel that can sustain uniaxial strain no more than 39% at room temperature (Figure 3C and see Figure S9, Supporting Information, for details of the mechanical tests). Hydrogels containing a lower concentration of crosslinked CCP and either MCP1 or MCP2, in the absence of ZnSO 4 , demonstrated improved stretchability over the above control (average uniaxial strain of 94% and 72%, respectively) at the cost of reducing the ultimate strength by approximately an order of magnitude.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nB) Force-extension profiles of individual molecules show similar elasticity.

Tough hydrogels are formed, depending on the concentration of ZnSO 4 present in the system. D) When the interpenetrating network hydrogel is stretched and relaxed, the phase transitioned ELP can be disrupted and reformed, respectively. Reversible decrosslinking/ crosslinking also occurs within the MCP network while the CCP network maintains elasticity throughout.opaque at room temperature (Figure 2B and Figure S13, Supporting Information) due to the effect of the kosmotropic salt lowering the cloud point of the aqueous ELP to a temperature below ambient.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition, the adhesion strength increases dramatically from 4.37 to 172 N m -1 when the concentration of Zn 2+ is increased from 0 to 1.5 m, indicating that the metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions of the network across the material's interface endows these networks with self-adhesive properties. It is notable that the level of adhesion strength achieved here is much higher than recently developed nanoparticle adhesives for gels and biological tissues, [34] although it is lower than the adhesion of tough hydrogels on various nonporous solid surfaces recently achieved. [35,36] Further investigation into the relative contributions of the metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions to enhance adhesion will be considered in future studies.In summary, we have demonstrated that genetically engineered unstructured proteins with covalent and reversible crosslinking (due to metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions) yield hydrogels with extremely high strength (>2.5 MPa), toughness (>1300 J m -2 ), stretchability (>500%), and self-adhesion in Zn 2+ solutions.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A modular and tunable approach towards design of built-to-order nanoparticle systems, spray coating on PRINT\u00ae particles is demonstrated to achieve technologies capable of targeted interactions with cancer cells for applications in drug delivery. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA range of polyelectrolyte multilayers were explored, including poly-L-lysine (PLL)/hyaluronic acid (HA) [PLL/HA 500K ], PLL/dextran sulfate (DXS) [PLL/DXS], PLL/poly(acrylic acid) [PLL/PAA], chitosan/HA [Chit/HA 500K ], and chitosan/PAA [Chit/PAA] (see Supplemental Figure 4), further illustrating a primary advantage of LbL as a means of tailoring the surface properties of these NP systems. These films, while diverse in the range of materials incorporated, behaved similarly in coating the NP systems without compromising the particle shape or significantly increasing the size beyond a few tens of nanometers.Recovered and purified particles visualized by electron microscopy, including SEM and TEM, are displayed in Figures 3 and4. Figures 3A and3B are representative of the uncoated, crosslinked PRINT\u00ae PLGA 200\u00d7200nm particle array, along with the corresponding recovered particles observed by both SEM (Figure 3C) and TEM (Figure 4B).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis effectively demonstrates the capability of Spray-LbL as a means of tuning film thickness by incorporating higher molecular weight polymers with more bilayer coatings. Additional parameters to tune film thickness are longer spray times and higher concentrations of material sprayed.As an additional test of particle functionalization, the polycationic layer, poly-L-lysine (PLL), was labeled with a Cy5.5 dye (Lumiprobe, Cy5.5-NHS ester). Deposition was tracked using fluorescence imaging and shown to significantly increase following layers 1 and 3, consistent with the subsequent addition of PLL Cy5.5 . This is also demonstrated by directly comparing PLL/DXS films cast both with and without PLLCy5.5 using confocal microscopy (Supplemental Figure 6).While particle functionalization is clearly demonstrated and in a reproducible manner, questions regarding biological functionality remained as this component of the carrier system is critical to the translational relevance of the technology. Using the labeled PLL Cy5.5 Spray-LbL functionalized NP systems, particles were incubated with a triple negative breast cancer cell line, BT-20.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis step therefore allowed for the deposition of water-based polyelectrolytes using Spray-LbL.As shown in Scheme 1, Spray-LbL on PRINT\u00ae nanoparticles, following vapor-phase crosslinking of the PVA support films, is achieved by spraying an aqueous solution of cationic polyelectrolyte is sprayed onto the NP containing films for 3 seconds and, after briefly rinsing with water (3 seconds), an anionic polyelectrolyte is subsequently sprayed onto the films (3 seconds). This cycle can then be repeated indefinitely to control the thickness of the polyelectrolyte coating. In the final step, the particles are harvested by sonicating the films in water, which causes the particles to detach from the PVA substrate.Using AFM, the shape, persistence and uniformity of the particles were monitored with each processing step, beginning with the initial NP array, followed by crosslinking, and subsequent Spray-LbL deposition, as shown in Figure 2 (corresponding amplitude images shown in Supplemental Figure 3).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Phonons in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were recently found to exhibit unique thickness dependence due to the interplay between short and long range interactions. Here we report Raman spectra of atomically thin sheets of WS2 and WSe2, isoelectronic compounds of MoS2, in the mono- to few-layer thickness regime. We show that, similar to the case of MoS2, the characteristic A1g and E2g(1) modes exhibit stiffening and softening with increasing number of layers, respectively, with a small shift of less than 3 cm(-1) due to large mass of the atoms. Thickness dependence is also observed in a series of multiphonon bands arising from overtone, combination, and zone edge phonons, whose intensity exhibit significant enhancement in excitonic resonance conditions. Some of these multiphonon peaks are found to be absent only in monolayers. These features provide a unique fingerprint and rapid identification for monolayer flakes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe peak positions agree well with the previous reports 53,54 . As shown in Figure 2, the 1gA phonon stiffens and 12 g E phonon softens with increasing flake thickness similar to the case of MoS 2 42 and as predicted by recent theoretical studies 43 . The difference in the frequency of these peaks is 60 and 65 cm -1 for monolayer and bulk samples, respectively (Figure 2b). The intensity ratios ( 1gA / 12 g E ) show a similar trend as seen in MoS 2 . The FWHM is found to consistently decrease with increasing number of layers (Figure 2c).Raman spectra of WSe 2 flakes measured in two polarization configurations and with 633 nm excitation are shown in Figure 3a. In contrast to the case in WS 2 , the parallel polarization spectra of WSe 2 flakes exhibit one prominent peak with a small shoulder in the frequency region where 1gA and 12 g E peaks are expected to be observed 57 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt should be noted that resonance Raman features are also seen with 473 nm excitation but to a lesser degree (See Supporting Information for details).Figure 5b highlights that a peak at ~ 310 cm -1 , which is consistently observed for multilayer flakes of WS 2 , is absent in monolayers. The origin of this mode is not clear, however, its absence in monolayers suggests that it may be related to rigid layer shear.Relatively large frequency of this peak suggests that it is a combination of low-frequency modes 26,45 with another phonon mode. Figure 6b shows that similar behavior is observed in a peak located around 308 cm -1 for WSe 2 . This peak is absent in monolayers and shows clear softening with increasing thickness. Thus, it is possibly a combination mode of a shear and \nMethodsBulk crystals of 2H-WS 2 and 2H-WSe 2 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT). Bulk crystals of 2H-WS 2 and 2H-WSe 2 crystals were mechanically exfoliated on to quartz substrates and used for subsequent spectroscopic characterization.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDue to the heavy atoms, WSe 2 shows the smallest thickness dependent shift (~ 1.3 cm -1 ) for the two modes.The small thickness dependence of the 1gA and 12 g E peaks in WS 2 and WSe 2 imply that they are not ideal fingerprints for identifying the number of layers.

Here we analysed variation at eight microsatellite loci to assess the genetic structure and to infer patterns of larval dispersal for a brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, at an isolated system of reefs in northern Western Australia. Spatial autocorrelation analyses show that populations are locally subdivided, and that the majority of larvae recruit to within 100 m of their natal colony. Further, a combination of F- and R- statistics showed significant differentiation at larger spatial scales (2-60 km) between sites, and this pattern was clearly not associated with distance. However, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled. Individual assignments of these migrants to the most likely populations suggest that the majority of migrants were produced at the only site that was not decimated by a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching event. Furthermore, the only site that recovered to prebleaching levels received most of these immigrants. We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2005a;Underwood et al . 2006). Here, we present biological data utilizing the microsatellites developed by Underwood et al . (2006) to investigate the pattern of genetic connectivity among populations of the brooding pocilloporid Seriatopora hystrix within the Scott Reef system in northern Western Australia.The life history characteristics and genetic structure of S. hystrix suggest that the majority of dispersal is local. Larvae are produced sexually through internal fertilization of the eggs, are brooded within the polyp, and then released into the water column at an advanced developmental stage. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that larvae are competent to settle within hours and that most will settle within one or two days of release, provided suitable substrata are available (Harrison & Wallace 1990). In addition, it is unlikely that sperm survive for more than 10 h (Wallace & Willis 1994).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1 3 2\nLocalized recruitment and heterozygote deficitsAt the local scale, the spatial autocorrelation analyses demonstrated that proximate corals are more genetically alike than corals that are further apart, indicating that disproportionately more larvae settle within 20 m of their natal colony. Specifically, in both the single correlogram and the multiple distance class analysis, the strongest positive genetic correlation was detected at the smallest distance class of 0-20 m, and this declined to zero as distances between corals increased (Fig. 3). Because these analyses were based on data from the six sites, and genetic distances were computed relative to the variation within sites only, it seems that gene flow over this scale is influenced by processes common throughout the Scott Reef system. This conclusion was supported by the correlograms from individual sites (not shown). While having less statistical power, these correlograms from each site showed similar patterns to the combined correlogram; five of the six sites exhibited maximum positive genetic correlation over the first few distance classes, which then declined to become negative at distance classes greater than 100 m. The common occurrence of heterozygote deficits observed here further emphasizes the localized nature of recruitment in this species.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled.

We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nIntroductionFor marine organisms whose life histories include a pelagic larval phase, the spatial scale and pattern of demographic connection among populations have profound ramifications for their survival, regeneration and evolution (Hellberg et al . 2002;Gaines et al . 2003;Ayre & Hughes 2004). For example, the resilience of populations to severe disturbances depends on the supply of larvae from outside the disturbed area. If local production contributes to the majority of recruitment, that population will be slow to recover when the impacts occur throughout that local scale.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Partially reduced nickel interfaced with nickel oxide results from thermal decomposition of nickel hydroxide precursors bonded to carbon nanotube sidewalls. The metal ion-carbon nanotube interactions impede complete reduction and Ostwald ripening of nickel species into the less hydrogen evolution reaction active pure nickel phase.

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe number of descriptors has an immediate impact on the feasibility of any ML potential, as it does not only restrict the efficiency of the energy evaluation but also determines the dimensionality of the coordinate space to be mapped by the training sets. On the other hand, the number of descriptors must be sufficiently large to enable an unambiguous distinction of different structures. In Secs. II B 1-II B 4 several descriptors which have been developed for ML potentials are discussed. This list is by far not complete, and there are plenty of new interesting approaches, which have been proposed recently, like moment tensors, 30 scattering transforms, 31 and many others.\nB. Descriptors for machine learning potentials\nAtom centered symmetry functionsA ML approach applicable to high-dimensional systems containing large numbers of atoms has been proposed by Behler and Parrinello in 2007 employing NNs. 32 As in many conventional empirical potentials, the potential energy E is constructed as a sum of local atomic energies E i of all atoms i in the system,E = N atoms \ued70 i=1 E i .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n45,46 Starting with NNs 32 in 2007, several different ML approaches suitable for high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms have now become available 38,40 and are still evolving rapidly. 10,47,48 An overview about the increasing use of different ML techniques to the construction of PESs is shown in Fig. 1.In this section, several ML methods along with their use in the construction of PESs are outlined, which in principle could be combined almost arbitrarily with the descriptors discussed above. Still, currently there are a few dominant combinations of descriptors and ML methods, but this is not because of the compatibility or incompatibility of the different approaches, but it is mainly a consequence of the personal preferences of the developers. \nB. Neural networksArtificial neural networks are the oldest ML method 49 and they have first been developed to understand the signal processing in the brain. They also represent the first ML method which has been used to fit a DFT PES by Doren and coworkers in 1995, 26 and to date a large number of NN potentials have been developed for many molecular and condensed systems.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA special focus is put on the two central components of any ML potential: the transformation of the atomic positions onto suitable descriptors and the subsequent assignment of an energy to this structure using a functional form provided by a ML method. Since there is no strict border between ML potentials and other available mathematical fitting approaches to represent PESs, the list of methods covered in this perspective cannot be complete, and several important related approaches like splines, 17 modified Shepard interpolation, 18 interpolating moving least squares, 19 and permutation invariant polynomial fits, 20 which are very similar in spirit in that they do not employ a physically derived functional form and to some extent face similar challenges, will not be discussed here.\nII. STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION\nA. The role of the descriptorMany different names have been used in the literature for the effective coordinates, i.e., the descriptors, representing the structural inputs for the ML algorithms. The set of descriptors plays a central role, not only in the construction of PESs, 21 but also beyond in applications like structure-property relationships for property prediction in materials science 22 and also in the strongly related older field of QSAR.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The key concept involves self-generation of auxiliary evanescent fields which facilitate the required local power conservation, without interfering with the device performance in the far field. We demonstrate our scheme by presenting exact reactive solutions to the challenging problems of reflectionless beam splitting and perfect reflection, verified via full wave simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIndeed, the formulation in [18] showed that sufficient conditions to ensure passive and lossless design in this case include local power conservation and local wave-impedance equalization, requiring at least one additional diffraction mode, e.g. specular reflection. Although this reflection is minor for small-tomoderate angle refraction, it becomes significant when wide-angle refraction is considered.These observations raised serious questions regarding previously-reported achievements.Primarily, could passive lossless metasurfaces achieve truly-reflectionless engineered refraction? In a recent paper, Wong et al. [20] provided a positive answer to that question. Relying on generalized scattering matrix theory, the authors showed that an asymmetric stacking of three reactance sheets could be designed to simultaneously match the wave impedance of both the incident and refracted plane waves, leading to zero reflections even in the case of wide-angle refraction. This approach was generalized in [21], showing that this structure corresponds to an omega-type bianisotropic metasurface (O-BMS). In O-BMSs, meta-atoms exhibit electric and magnetic polarizabilities as in HMSs, but also feature magnetoelectric coupling [2,22].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMany innovative low-profile devices manipulating the phase, magnitude, and polarization of aperture fields have been reported in recent years [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16], pointing out the immense potential of these surfaces in optics and microwave physics and engineering.While the first demonstrations used a single layer of electrically polarizable particles (meta-atoms) [6], it was soon found that these suffer from a limited transmission efficiency.To achieve a unity transmission magnitude with arbitrary transmission phase, both electrically and magnetically polarizable meta-atoms must be used [8,9,17]. When illuminated by an incident field, such metasurfaces induce orthogonal electric and (equivalent) magnetic currents on the surface, forming Huygens' sources, capable of unidirectional radiation (i.e., full transmission) [9]. This phenomenon can be fully accounted for by the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) [1][2][3][4][5], formulating the equivalent boundary conditions posed by the metasurface.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo the best of our knowledge, whether or not an accurate design of passive lossless metasurfaces for such applications is possible remains an open question.In this Letter, we propose a different paradigm to tackle these problems. The solution relies on the theorem proved in [21], indicating that any field transformation that locallyconserves the real power can be implemented by passive and lossless O-BMSs. Once this is established, designing a reflectionless refracting metasurface becomes trivial, as both the incident and transmitted plane waves feature a uniform power profile on the metasurface; local power conservation is thus achieved by proper stipulation of the field amplitudes [20,21] (this result was independently derived in [24]). On the other hand, trying to apply this theorem naively for the cases of beam splitting or engineered reflection will fail, as the simple stipulation of the incident and diffracted fields forms non-trivial spatially-varying power profiles on the metasurface, which do not match, in general.Hence, the key concept underlying our solution is the use of auxiliary fields to achieve local power conservation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles, birds (sampled with point-counts PC and mist net-MN), saplings, and trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and recurrent-burned forest were higher than between control and once-burned forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation communities in recurrent-burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms acting behind them. Policy-makers need to explicitly address protection of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2008, McMichael et al. 2012). However, in recent decades, especially in Brazil and Indonesia, fire-return intervals have become decadal or even shorter in some forests (Cochrane 2003, Langner & Siegert 2009). This increase in fire prevalence is primarily caused by an increase in ignition sources from agricultural activities that use fire as a tool for land management (Laurance 2004, Cardoso et al. 2008, Morton et al. 2013) and an increase in forest flammability from other human activities, such as logging and fragmentation (Cochrane 2001, Siegert et al. 2001). In addition, fires are often associated with severe droughts (Chen et al. 2011). For example, around 2.6 million hectares and 3.9 million hectares of forest were burned during El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in Indonesia and Brazilian Amazon (Siegert et al. 2001, Alencar et al. 2006, respectively).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2001, Alencar et al. 2006, respectively). Most of the predictions of fires associated to climate changes and human land uses in general, state that such events may occur more often in the coming years (e.g., Cochrane & Barber 2009, Fu et al. 2013), affecting not only Amazon forest, but also the hyper-fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, the interactions between human economic activities, climate change, and fire pose a serious threat for tropical forests.One of the consequences of this increase in fire-return intervals is an increase in the area of forests being subjected to repeated burns, which can alter forest structure and composition when compared to single burns (Barlow & Peres 2008). For example, when tropical forests are burned for the first time (or when fire-return intervals are millennial), it is a surface fire that usually burns just a thin layer of available fuels, such as the leaf litter and small fallen branches, as well as some small trees and saplings (Cochrane et al. 1999). Although these fires are relatively small, they kill a large proportion of trees and aboveground bio-mass (Cochrane et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2002, Barlow & Peres 2008, Silveira et al. 2013, respectively), reduce sapling, seedling and tree densities (Clearly et al. 2006), and cause substantial reptile mortality (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998). Existing studies on the impacts of recurrent fires are primarily focused on plants (e.g., Cochrane & Schulze 1999, Barlow et al. 2003a,b, Haugaasen et al. 2003a, Slik & Eichhorn 2003, Toma et al. 2005, Barlow & Peres 2008, Slik et al. 2008) and secondly on birds (e.g., Barlow & Peres 2004, Adeney et al. 2006, Mestre et al. 2013).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The electrospun polyimide employed is stable against highly reactive molten lithium and, via a conformal layer of zinc oxide coating to render the surface lithiophilic, molten lithium can be drawn into the matrix, affording a nano-porous lithium electrode. Importantly, the polymeric backbone enables uniform lithium stripping/plating, which successfully confines lithium within the matrix, realizing minimum volume change and effective dendrite suppression. The porous electrode reduces the effective current density; thus, flat voltage profiles and stable cycling of more than 100 cycles is achieved even at a high current density of 5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 in both carbonate and ether electrolyte. The advantages of the porous, polymeric matrix provide important insights into the design principles of lithium metal anodes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOn one hand, the use of solid electrolytes to suppress dendrite propagation remains premature in the current stage [15][16][17] , for they often fall short of meeting the high-power requirement at ambient temperature due to limited ionic conductivity 18,19 , together with issues such as large interfacial impedance 20,21 . On the other hand, the most common approaches to dendrite mitigation in liquid electrolyte focus on the stabilization of SEI via adjusting the electrolyte composition and additives [22][23][24][25][26] . Though proven to be effective, most additives will be continuously consumed during battery cycling so that the suppression effect is not fully sustainable [27][28][29] . Alternatively, the application of a mechanically stable artificial SEI coating such as polymer or solid-state blocking layers has been proposed [30][31][32][33] . For example, a promising nanoscale interfacial engineering approach has been demonstrated recently based on interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres, ultrathin two-dimensional boron nitride or oxidized polyacrylonitrile fibres to control the dendrite growth and improve the cycling CE [34][35][36] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn addition, it is well known that the effective current density during Li stripping/plating has a crucial impact on the dendrite formation and growth 37,46 . Lower effective current density results in reduced electrolyte decomposition and related SEI formation during cycling so as to suppress the dendrite growth 37 . Therefore, the porous electrode structure, in addition to the non-conducting polymeric matrix, which led to the well-confined Li dissolution/deposition behaviour, effectively ensured the dendrite-free cycling of the Li-coated PI electrode, giving rise to stable long-term performance.In conclusion, our work demonstrates the method of obtaining a free-standing, porous metallic Li anode by infusing molten Li into a core-shell PI-ZnO matrix. The excellent heat resistance and chemical stability of the PI fibres guaranteed the structural integrity of the matrix during Li coating and the subsequent battery cycling, while the conformal ALD ZnO coating provided the driving force for the molten Li infusion. Noticeably, the exposed non-conducting fibres after Li stripping prevented the direct plating of Li on the top surface of the electrode, which effectively confined Li within the matrix.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition, complete confinement of Li within the matrix is necessary to preserve a constant electrode dimension; therefore, the direct nucleation of Li on the top surface of the matrix should be prevented, as reported in previous studies 31,34 . Moreover, a porous electrode is desirable since a reduced local current density is beneficial to alleviate dendrite propagation 37,38 . Following the aforementioned rationale, a Li-coated polyimide (PI) matrix design for metallic Li anode is proposed. The electrospun polymeric fibres guarantee a chemically and electrochemically inert matrix, which is favourable to confine the stripping/plating of Li solely within the matrix. Notably, the choice of PI is rather unique for it is one of the only few high-performance polymers that exhibit excellent chemical stability, heat resistance and mechanical strength above the melting point of Li (180 \u00b0C) 39 . However, the wetting of molten Li on PI polymer is poor.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, dendrite growth and limited Coulombic efficiency during cycling have prevented its practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we report that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt enables the high-rate cycling of a lithium metal anode at high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.1%) without dendrite growth. With 4\u2009M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the electrolyte, a lithium|lithium cell can be cycled at 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 6,000 cycles, and a copper|lithium cell can be cycled at 4\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4%. These excellent performances can be attributed to the increased solvent coordination and increased availability of lithium ion concentration in the electrolyte. Further development of this electrolyte may enable practical applications for lithium metal anode in rechargeable batteries. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nZheng et al. 8 used interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres to stabilize Li surface with a CE of B99% for 4150 cycles. However, no electrolytes have been reported to date that simultaneously overcome all of the challenges-dendritic metal deposition, low CE during Li deposition/stripping processes and poor rate performance-of Li metal electrodes. Most of the approaches reported to date mainly worked at relatively low current densities (o1 mA cm \u00c0 2 ), which are insufficient to meet the requirements for many practical applications (43 mA cm \u00c0 2 ) 2,8,10,11 . Therefore, new electrolytes that can lead to the high rate and stable cycling of the Li metal anode are urgently needed for the further development of rechargeable Li metal batteries.Here we demonstrate that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the salt lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI or LiN(SO 2 F) 2 ) 30 results in the dendrite-free plating of Li metal at high rates and with high CE.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSeveral years earlier, it was reported by Henderson (one of the coauthors in this work), as well as other researchers, that highly concentrated liquid electrolytes prepared with glyme solvents and lithium salts have both a relatively high ionic conductivity and high oxidative stability [17][18][19][20][21][22] . More recently, a number of publications have shown the striking differences between the properties and cell performances for dilute and highly concentrated electrolytes with glyme solvents, as well as other aprotic solvents [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] . One study, in particular, found that highly concentrated LiTFSI-1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/DME electrolytes inhibited Li metal dendritic growth, but the Li plating/stripping CE was reported to be rather low (B71%) 24 . Lu et al. 11 reported that stable Li depositions can be obtained in the liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charging and discharging. Zheng et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe use of additives (for example, vinylene carbonate (VC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and so on) and/or replacement of the LiPF 6 electrolyte salt with other salts-such as LiAsF 6 , LiBF 4 , LiClO 4 , LiCF 3 SO 3 or LiTFSI (that is, LiN(SO 2 CF 3 ) 2 )-does not ameliorate this poor performance to any significant extent 12 . The search for other solvents for this application has also been problematic. Electrolytes based on ether solvents generally result in a less-dendritic Li morphology and improved CE for Li plating/stripping owing to their lower reactivity with Li metal 10 , but these features are not retained on prolonged cycling 5 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Multi-geochemical proxies, including different iron speciation and relevant ratios (FeHR/FeT, FeP/FeHR and FeT/Al ratios) and molybdenum concentrations, were used to reconstruct the paleo-depositional environment of this black shale horizon. The ratios of different iron species (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR < 0.80) suggest an overall anoxic conditions (ferruginous) over the deposition of the black shales, although intermittent euxinic (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR \u2248 0.80) and oxic (FeHR/FeT < 0.38) intervals could have occurred. Furthermore, FeT/Al ratios (FeT/Al \u2264 0.51) confirm that water column may not be persistent euxinia during the deposition of the Datangpo black shales. Meanwhile, molybdenum concentrations show a decreasing trend towards the top of the black shales, reconciling the gradual oxygenating trend during this period as stated above. Compared to \u03b434SPy values in the Mesoproterozoic deep ocean, more positive \u03b434SPy values of this study may result from a small size of sulfate reservoir. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n820 Ma and 542 Ma (Li et al., 2003;Wang and Li, 2003;Wang et al., 2009). A southeast-facing (present orientation) passive continental margin on the Yangtze Block was subsequently developed in the course of breakup of the Rodinia Supercontinent (Fig. 1A). Thermal subsidence related to the post-rift extension of South China Block created significant accommodation space in which thick Middle-to-Late Neoproterozoic successions were deposited (Jiang et al., 2003;Wang and Li, 2003).Neoproterozoic stratigraphic successions in South China comprise well exposed, relatively unaltered glacial and interglacial deposits (Fig. 1B). The Cryogenian Group unconformably overlies the slate rocks of the Banxi Group. Two main Cryogenian diamictite successions, the lower Jiangkou Group and the upper Nantuo Formation, have been recognized in South China.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe interglacial Datangpo Formation of manganese-bearing shales, \u223c 10 m thick on the upper slope to \u223c 200 m thick on the lower slope (Wang and Li, 2003), sits on the glacial deposits of the Jiangkou Group. The Datangpo Formation includes the lower thinner black shales (\u223c30 m thick), the focus of this study, and the upper thicker grey shales (\u223c 200 m thick) (Fig. 1B). A pair U-Pb zircon ages of 663 \u00b1 4 Ma (Zhou et al., 2004) and 654.5 \u00b1 3.8 Ma (Zhang et al., 2008) for the tuffaceous beds in the basal and topmost Datangpo Formation provides a constraint for the timing of this interglacial interval.\nMethodsIn this study, we choose the Mingle section, where the interglacial Datangpo Formation comprises the lower 30 m-thick black shales and the upper 180 m-thick grey shales (Fig. 1).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn contrast, in the absence of metazoan fossils during the Cryogenian Period (750-635 Ma), less attention was paid to the oceanic changes of that time.Here, we use multi-proxies, including ratios of highly reactive iron (Fe HR ) to total iron (Fe T ) (Fe HR /Fe T ), pyrite iron (Fe P ) to highly reactive iron (Fe HR ) (Fe P /Fe HR ), total iron (Fe T ) to Al (Fe T /Al), and Mo concentrations, to illustrate the oceanic redox conditions, under which sulfur cycling was discussed as well based on the sulfur isotopic data of pyrite (\u03b4 34 S py ) during the Cryogenian Period in South China.\nGeological settingsThe South China Block is generally considered to have been formed through amalgamation between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks during the Sibao orogeny at ca. 1.1-0.9 Ga (Li et al., 2002;Li et al., 2009;Ye et al., 2007), which then experienced episodic rifting between ca.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Yet, half of all the resulting publications appeared since 2000. The history of research before 1998 is described in five stages defined by publication spikes; subsequent work is not covered because historical perspective is lacking. In stage 1 (1871\u20131907), \u2018Cambrian\u2019 (now Neoproterozoic) glaciation was recognized successively in Scotland, Australia, India, Norway, Svalbard and China. Criteria for recognition included faceted and striated pebbles in matrix-supported conglomerates resting on ice-worn bedrock pavements. In stage 2 (1908\u20131940), Neoproterozoic glaciation was shown to have been widespread in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Major textbooks summarized these findings, but the rejection of continental drift (to account for late Palaeozoic glacial dynamics) put a chill on research. In stage 3 (1942\u20131964), the occurrence of glacial deposits within carbonate successions, as well as nascent palaeomagnetic observations, suggested that Neoproterozoic glaciers reached sea-level at low palaeolatitudes, but the belated recognition of sediment gravity flowage caused glacial interpretations to be prematurely abandoned in key areas. In stage 4 (1965\u20131981), the extent of Neoproterozoic glaciation was rethought in light of plate tectonics. Distinctive chemical sediments (iron\u00b1manganese formations and cap carbonates) were identified. In basic climate models, modest lowering of solar luminosity resulted in global glaciation due to ice-albedo feedback, and deglaciation due to greenhouse forcing resulted from silicate-weathering feedback in the carbon cycle. Neoproterozoic glacial geologists were blind to these ideas. In stage 5 (1982\u20131997), reliable palaeomagnetic data combined with glacial marine sedimentation models confirmed that Neoproterozoic ice sheets reached sea level close to the palaeoequator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTen substantial papers describe Neoproterozoic glacial deposits in different parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and North America. Highlights include first-hand accounts of various pre-Dwyka glacial deposits throughout southern Africa (Gevers & Beetz 1940), the vast extent of the Nantuo Tillite in South China (Lee & Lee 1940) and the existence of glacial deposits in central Africa close to the equator (Davies 1940;Robert 1940). A consensus emerged that 'eo-Cambrian' glaciation was matched only in the late Palaeozoic, and that invertebrate animals arose following retreat of the ice sheets.However, the rejection of continental drift in the late 1920s following intense debate (Newman 1995;Oreskes 1999) had a chilling effect on pre-Pleistocene palaeoclimate research. If late Palaeozoic glaciation was allowed to remain 'a hopeless riddle', as Wegener put it, what chance was there to understand glacial periods twice their age?\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNeoproterozoic glacial geologists were blind to these ideas. In stage 5 (1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997), reliable palaeomagnetic data combined with glacial marine sedimentation models confirmed that Neoproterozoic ice sheets reached sea level close to the palaeoequator.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nThe first Neoproterozoic glacial deposits were found in the SW of Scotland in 1871 and the rate of their discovery on 23 palaeocontinents and microcontinents was essentially linear until 1992 (Fig. 2.1). However, half of all the papers (n \u00bc 811) written on them before the end of 2008 were published in the previous 10 years (Fig. 2.2). This surge in activity is the justification for the present volume, but this history ends at 1997.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFaceted and striated clasts in diamictites were the decisive criteria for glaciogenesis, with a striated subglacial pavement beautifully exposed beneath 'Reusch's Moraine' (Fig. 2.3) in Finnmark, Norway, for good measure.The second period  saw Neoproterozoic glacial deposits recognized in southern, central and western Africa, central and northern Asia, eastern and western North America and eastern South America (Fig. 2.1, Table 2.1). It was evident that glaciation 'at or just before the beginning of the Cambrian' had been more extreme than in the Pleistocene, possibly equal to the composite Late Palaeozoic glaciations of Gondwanaland. These findings were highlighted in a Symposium on Palaeozoic and Pre-Cambrian Climates at the 17th IGC (1937) in Moscow.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As suggested previously, a turbulent flow is driven by geothermal heating at the seafloor, which is balanced by a similar heat loss through the ice sheet above. It is argued that the expected horizontal inhomogeneities in these heat fluxes are sufficient to generate baroclinic instability, which drives geostrophic turbulence. Turbulent eddies then transport heat upward and poleward along isolines of constant density, thereby maintaining a statically stable stratification, contrary to previous findings from numerical models that do not adequately resolve the geostrophic turbulence. The kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is expected to be controlled by a balance between the potential energy input by the diabatic forcing and frictional dissipation in the bottom boundary layer. The resulting characteristic flow speed is estimated to be on the order of 1 cm s\u22121, which is in agreement with previous numerical simulations. Eddy diffusivities are estimated to be on the order of 100 m2 s\u22121, which is smaller than in the present-day ocean but probably within one order of magnitude. Because of the weak forcing, the resulting gradients of temperature and salinity would be much smaller than in the present-day ocean, with global-scale potential temperature variations on the order of 0.1 K, again in agreement with previous numerical simulations. The presented theoretical arguments may also be relevant to other planetary bodies with an ice-covered ocean. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNeoproterozoic 'snowball Earth' simulations with a coupled climate/ice-sheet model\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWTHyde\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTJCrowley\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSKBaum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWRPeltier\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/35013005\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNature\n\t\t\n\t\t\t405\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2000\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMinimal adjustment of hydrographic profiles to achieve static stability\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDRJackett\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTJMcdougall\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1175/1520-0426(1995)012<0381:MAOHPT>2.0.CO;2\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

Graphene has been recently explored as a two-dimensional nanoscale material, and has demonstrated simple device functions based on conventional top-down fabrication. However, the synthetic approach to encoding electronic functionality and thus enabling an entire integrated graphene electronics in a chemical synthesis had not previously been demonstrated. Here we report an unconventional approach for the synthesis of monolithically-integrated electronic devices based on graphene and graphite. Spatial patterning of heterogeneous catalyst metals permits the selective growth of graphene and graphite, with controlled number of graphene layers. Graphene transistor arrays with graphitic electrodes and interconnects were formed from synthesis. These functional, all-carbon structures were transferrable onto a variety of substrates. The integrated transistor arrays were used to demonstrate real-time, multiplexed chemical sensing, and more significantly, multiple carbon layers of the graphene-graphite device components were vertically assembled to form a three-dimensional flexible structure which served as a top-gate transistor array. These results represent a substantial progress towards encoding electronic functionality via chemical synthesis and suggest future promise for one-step integration of graphene-graphite based electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNo characteristic peak of the metals was detected, which indicated that metal catalysts were completely removed by the etching process.Electrical properties of graphene and graphite can be modulated by controlling the number of graphene layers (n). First, we show that conductivity or sheet resistance can be controlled by more than an order of magnitude, dependent on n. Films of graphene and graphite with differing n were synthesized using different metal catalyst films as previously described (also see Methods and Supplementary Information). Fig. 2a shows the sheet resistance values of graphene and graphite measured using a four-point probe, as a function of n. The sheet resistance was reduced about 25 times (from 2,463\u00b11,037 \u03a9/sq down to 98\u00b146 \u03a9/sq), as n increased from ~2-4 to ~850 layers. The local variation of n influences the deviation of the sheet resistance. We also characterized the field-effect response of both 2-4 layer graphene and ~850 layer graphite (Supplementary Fig. S5).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nS5). Current versus backgate characteristics showed much stronger modulation in 2-4 layer graphene, compared to negligible change in the thick graphite (~850 layers) due to stronger screening effect as the number of layers increases 26 . The low sheet resistance and field-effect response of graphite are advantageous for applications in conductive films or electrodes, in contrast to superior transconductance level of the 2-4 layer graphene which is appropriate for active channels of field-effect transistors (FETs).The capability to modulate electronic properties through synthetic control of the graphite thickness provides a route to rationally designing and synthesizing large-scale electronics based entirely on carbon. The metal catalyst, Cu/Ni (700 nm/5 nm), was used to synthesize 2-4 layer graphene channels and the same combination with an additional Co (400 nm) was used to produce graphite electrodes which serve as the source (S) and drain (D) (Fig. 2b). This method enabled the fabrication of all-carbon based transistor arrays which were then transferred onto a 285 nm-thick SiO 2 on Si wafer for measurement of backgate response.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition to contact properties of graphite electrode to graphene channel, advantages of the graphite, compared to metals, lie in its superb mechanical flexibility. We observed that even when graphite electrodes were distorted up to strain of ~2 %, I-V characteristics remained the same (Fig. 2f).The synthetic method facilitated the creation of a large-scale field-effect sensor arrays composed of monolithic graphene-graphite, which were transferred onto 285-nm SiO 2 / Si wafer. One block of the array contained nine of 2-4 layer graphene field-effect sensors with graphite single common source and independent drains. The sensor chip had four of these blocks composed of 36 sensor devices total, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The graphite electrode parts were covered with a 2 \u03bcm-thick SU8 passivation layer with openings around the 2-4 layer graphene channels. The current change measured while sweeping Ag/AgCl water-gate voltage at different pH solution is presented in Fig. 3b. The charge neutrality point shifted positively with increasing pH, and the pH sensitivity was ~17 mV/pH.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this article, we map the allosteric network in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A using NMR spectroscopy. We show that positive allosteric cooperativity is generated by nucleotide and substrate binding during the transitions through the major conformational states: apo, intermediate, and closed. The allosteric network is disrupted by a single site mutation (Y204A), which also decouples the cooperativity of ligand binding. Because protein kinase A is the prototype for the entire kinome, these findings may serve as a paradigm for describing long-range coupling in other protein kinases. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOnly the phosphorylated S10 located in the A helix shows a drastic chemical-shift change. However, smaller changes are detected throughout the entire enzyme's backbone, which indicates that Kemptide binding radiates its effects to both lobes. Subsequent addition of AMP-PNP to the Kemptide-bound enzyme caused changes in three regions that are similar to the direct titration: around the glycine-rich loop, between the catalytic and peptide-positioning loops, and the unstructured C-terminal portion of the enzyme (SI Fig. 5). Irrespective of the order of ligands used in the titrations, the 2D 1 H/ 15 N TROSY-HSQC spectra of the closed form of the enzyme are superimposable, which illustrates the thermodynamic equivalence for binding pathways.  Cooperativity of Ligand Binding. Resonances undergoing fast exchange were selected for the calculation of the dissociation constants (K d ). Table 1 summarizes the calculated K d values, and representative fits are provided in SI Fig. 6.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese residues make contact with the evolutionarily conserved ''spine'' (L106, L95, F185, and Y164) recently identified by Kornev et al. (42), to form a hydrophobic lining about the adenine ring (Fig. 4). Sensing and positioning of the nucleotide at this region could act as a trigger for signaling, which is propagated across a network of residues away from the active site. Perturbations \u03fe0.05 ppm are traceable across conserved residues within van der Waals radii from the hydrophobic lining (Fig. 4). Several contiguous pathways of intramolecular cross-talk can also be traced from the hydrophobic lining to residues, which can propagate signals to and from the glycine-rich, activation, Asp-Phe-Gly, and peptide-positioning loops at the entrance of the active site. We also detected noncontiguous propagation for a small subset of residues in distal sites, for which no clear pathway of interaction can be traced. In the wild-type enzyme, two regions display relatively large \u232c\u2426 values.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis mutation is located in the peptide-positioning loop and yet the enzyme binds ATP and a peptide inhibitor similar to the wild-type enzyme (21). However, solvent accessibility and thermostability studies have pointed to a disruption of the allosteric network, which likely causes the 30-fold decrease in the enzyme's turnover rate (22,23). The direct titration using the nucleotide first resulted in a K d value of 78 \u03ee 20 M and an apparent K d value of 834 \u03ee 92 M for Kemptide. The reverse titration (Kemptide first) resulted in a K d value of 700 \u03ee 105 M for Kemptide and an apparent K d value of 68 \u03ee 4 M for AMP-PNP. The K d values (Table 1) for the mutant show no cooperative binding effect, indicating that the two binding events have become decoupled.

As a consequence, we are willing to use huge amounts of energy to produce it. Solid-state lighting (SSL) is an emerging technology that promises performance features and efficiencies well beyond those of traditional artificial lighting, accompanied by potentially massive shifts in (a) the consumption of light, (b) the human productivity and energy use associated with that consumption and (c) the semiconductor chip area inventory and turnover required to support that consumption. In this paper, we provide estimates of the baseline magnitudes of these shifts using simple extrapolations of past behaviour into the future. For past behaviour, we use recent studies of historical and contemporary consumption patterns analysed within a simple energy-economics framework (a Cobb\u2013Douglas production function and profit maximization). For extrapolations into the future, we use recent reviews of believed-achievable long-term performance targets for SSL. We also discuss ways in which the actual magnitudes could differ from the baseline magnitudes of these shifts. These include: changes in human societal demand for light; possible demand for features beyond lumens; and guidelines and regulations aimed at economizing on consumption of light and associated energy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch unenclosed outdoor areas (e.g. streets, parks and other recreation and public spaces) could all be rendered more useful if better illuminated in the evening hours (albeit at the cost of reducing the contrast of the night sky due to light pollution (Boyce 2003)). And there is a natural human tendency to gaze out (we value windows, not just because they are a portal for incoming light, but because of the view they afford (Boyce 2003)) into faraway spaces, even if we do not directly occupy those spaces.We conclude that it is possible that the average unshared illuminated area is nearing a saturation point, but plausible arguments can be made that the saturation point may yet be a factor 10\u00d7 or greater away.\nDemand for features beyond lumensAlthough the primary demand for light is to illuminate our environment, there are many other features of light that are important to the consumer. Arguably, these features were just as important as decreased cost in the historical increases in consumption of light as one lighting technology gave way to the next. They therefore counter the possible saturations in consumption of light that were discussed in section 5.1.For example, the transitions within chemical-fuel-based lighting (e.g.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSaturation in demand for raw lumensAs has been discussed, at current levels of per-capita consumption of light, there is no evidence that we have reached a saturation in the demand for light. It is nevertheless an open question whether we will approach such a saturation in the future or whether per-capita consumption of light will continue to scale linearly with gdp/CoL. To understand this question more quantitatively, we decompose per-capita consumption of light into the product of three factors: I N , the average illuminancefoot_11 (or light per unit area, in units of lm m -2 ) that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours; \u03c4 on /(\u03c4 on + \u03c4 off ), a dimensionless illumination duty factor that accounts for how many hours per year the area around a person is actually illuminated and a N /(1 + a N \u03c1 N ), the average unshared illuminated area (in units of m 2 ) that a person is surrounded by 24 . In other words,\u03d5 = I N \u2022 \u03c4 on \u03c4 on + \u03c4 off \u2022 a N 1 + a N \u03c1 N .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, an increase in the cost of energy associated with lighting, which would normally reduce both human productivity and energy consumption, can be mitigated by an increase in the efficiency of lighting: energy consumption can be held constant while maintaining some human productivity increase or energy consumption can be reduced without a decrease in human productivity.Whether history can be used in this case to predict the future cannot be known, of course, and there are at least two ways in which this growth might be moderated. First, as discussed in section 5.1, demand for light may be nearing saturation, both in terms of illuminances (lm m -2 ) as well as in terms of the per-capita illuminated areas surrounding people. Second, as discussed in section 5.3, even if intrinsic demand for light is not nearing saturation, non-legislated guidelines and legislated regulations aimed at efficient lighting system designs and light usage may nonetheless bring about a saturation.However, reasonable arguments can also be made that as a human society we are not near a saturation in consumption of light.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It has 22 spectral bands including the day/night band (DNB), which is a panchromatic reflective solar band (RSB) covering a wavelength range of 500\u2013900 nm. Similar to other RSBs, the radiometric calibration of the DNB is in reference to the sunlight reflected from an onboard solar diffuser (SD). As an independent validation to the SD measurement, lunar calibration has been regularly scheduled at nearly constant lunar phase. In this paper, the lunar calibration strategies developed for RSB are extended to DNB. The on-orbit gain coefficient, or the so-called F factor, is derived for DNB low-gain stage (LGS) from lunar data for each lunar calibration event. Its on-orbit change is compared with the change of the LGS SD F factor. For more accurate comparison, the impact of the on-orbit relative spectral responses (RSR) change, caused by the wavelength-dependent degradation of the optical throughput of VIIRS telescope mirrors, must be considered. This impact is more significant for DNB than other RSBs because of its wider bandwidth, and the impact to the SD and lunar calibrations are different due to different scene spectra. Simulation results show a gradually increased deviation of 1% between SD and lunar trends since launch till now and 0.3% deviation since 2 April 2012 lunar calibration, when the lunar F factor was firstly calculated, till now. Taking this effect into account, the on-orbit changes of the SD F factor and lunar F factor agree with each other in less than 0.3%. Our results validate the stability of the DNB SD calibration while demonstrating how the on-orbit RSR change should be considered in the radiometric calibration and data usage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe key design specification of DNB is summarized in Table 1. While OLS is not radiometrically calibrated, the absolute calibration requirement specification for the DNB is 5% at half maximum radiance and 10% at maximum radiance [Geis et al., 2012].The DNB sensor data record (SDR) of Earth view (EV) scene radiance is converted from the detector response in digital number (DN) using the calibrated detector gain coefficient or F factor. The calibration of the DNB LGS uses the solar diffuser (SD) view, and the procedure is similar to the one used for the other RSBs [Lei et al., 2015a;Lei et al., 2015b]. As has been demonstrated for other RSBs as well, the Moon can be used as a source to independently perform the calibration and track the stability of the SD calibration [Xiong et al., 2015].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn this paper, the deviation is estimated and verified by the measurement.   [Mills, 2010].Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\nDNB LGS Calibration and Calibration MethodologyThe DNB gain stages are automatically selected for EV images depending on the radiance level of each pixel.The gain stage information is recorded on a pixel level. For a given pixel, which can be operated at any of the three gain stages, the equation that yields DNB top-of-atmosphere radiance isL DNB \u00bc F LGS;LUT \u00c1 P 2 i\u00bc0 c i;LUT \u00c1dn i DNB RVS DNB;LUT ;(1)where the LGS F factor F LGS,LUT , the background DN offset,LUT , and the adjustment coefficients c i,LUT are regularly updated as look-up tables (LUT). Here dn DNB is background-subtracted detector response DN DNB \u00c0 DN offset,LUT . The F factor is half angle mirror (HAM) side, detector, and aggregation mode dependent. In operation, linear equation is used so c 0 and c 2 are set to 0.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSimilar to other RSBs, the radiometric calibration of the DNB is in reference to the sunlight reflected from an onboard solar diffuser (SD).

Here we introduce deterministic routes to low-modulus thin film materials with stress/strain responses that can be tailored precisely to match the non-linear properties of biological tissues, with application opportunities that range from soft biomedical devices to constructs for tissue engineering. The approach combines a low-modulus matrix with an open, stretchable network as a structural reinforcement that can yield classes of composites with a wide range of desired mechanical responses, including anisotropic, spatially heterogeneous, hierarchical and self-similar designs.

It was found that Cr species produced dumbbell-like nuclei which play a pivotal role in the formation of the Pt nanowires. Such Pt nanowires can be tuned to nanocubes by simply decreasing the concentration of [Cr(CO)6]. Compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst (45 wt%, Vulcan, Tanaka) and Pt black (fuel cell grade, Sigma), the synthesized Pt nanowires exhibit superior performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with a specific activity of 0.368 mA/cm2, which was 2.7 and 1.8 times greater than that of Pt/C (0.138 mA/cm2) and Pt black (0.202 mA/cm2), respectively. The mass activity of Pt nanowires (0.088 mA/\u03bcg) is 2.3 times that of Pt black (0.038 mA/\u03bcg) and comparable to that of Pt/C (0.085 mA/\u03bcg). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOther 1D platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts including PtFe nanowires [11], Pd-Pt dendrites [12], and Pd-Pt core-shell nanowires [13] also showed outstanding performance. However, the synthesis of high quality ultrathin (sub 5 nm) Pt nanowires with high aspect ratio and uniform diameter is still challenging [14,15]. Here we report the synthesis of Pt nanowires assisted by [Cr(CO) 6 ] and a study of their electrocatalytic properties in ORR. Such Pt nanowires can be readily tuned to nanocubes by decreasing the concentration of [Cr(CO) 6 ].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA general strategy for synthesizing FePt nanowires and nanorods\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYLHou\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJKim\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSHSun\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAngew.

This is the very first time both large electrochemical strains and fast response rates were achieved in the conducting polymer actuators.

We attribute ultralow thermal conductivity to a cluster rattling mechanism, based on strong phonon\u2013phonon scattering via the coexistence of collective motions involving various atom groups. These results call attention to the vital thermal transport processes and thermal management strategies for applications with all-inorganic halide perovskites. Further, CsSnI3 shows a rare combination of ultralow thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, so it can be a promising material for unique applications as an electrically conductive thermal insulator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nVia quantitative joint experimental-theoretical analysis, we present the unambiguous demonstration of the impact of cluster rattling mechanism on thermal transport properties: comparable and even lower k lattice of AIHPs compared with HHPs (18) (k HHP = 0.5 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 ) imply that the strength of phonon-phonon scattering induced by the cluster rattling mechanism is comparable to that originating from the individual rattlers. While the size, shape, symmetry, and vibrational modes of the organic molecule are key parameters for thermal transport properties in HHP (20), the topological pattern and bond strength distribution of the entire framework dictates thermal transport properties in AIHP.To understand other transport properties of CsSnI 3 , we measured the four-probe electrical conductivity (\u03c3) and Seebeck coefficient (S) of the exact same NW for thermal transport in Fig. 2C with the suspended microisland devices (Fig. 4A). At room temperature, \u03c3 is 282 S/cm and S is 79 \u03bcV/K. Temperaturedependent \u03c3 exhibits metallic behavior, and the positive sign of S indicates a hole-dominant (p-type) semiconductor, in agreement with previous studies (24).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWhile limited investigations of thermal transport in HHP have been reported and some aspects of thermal transport in HHP are understood, fundamental understanding of thermal transport in AIHP remains largely elusive. The thermal transport mechanism in AIHP is expected to be fundamentally different from that in HHP, since vibrational density of states in organic and inorganic ions are largely mismatched for HHP, and monoatomic Cs + in AIHP does not contain rotational modes in contrast to the CH 3 NH 3 + ion in HHP (20,21). Here, we synthesize AIHP CsPbI 3 , CsPbBr 3 , and CsSnI 3 nanowires (NWs) via solution processes, measure their ultralow thermal conductivity, and elucidate fundamental thermal Significance Discovery of materials with low thermal conductivity in simple, fully dense, and single-crystalline solids has proven extremely challenging.

However, fundamental study of thermal transport in halide perovskites has been significantly lacking despite its practical and fundamental importance. For HHP, very few experimental studies have been performed for thermal conductivity (18,19) and an ultralow thermal conductivity value of 0.5 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 has been reported for single-crystalline CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Computational study revealed that the main reason for the ultralow thermal conductivity of HHP is rotational motions of organic CH 3 NH 3 + ions (20)(21)(22). For instance, Hata et al. computationally demonstrated the critical role of CH 3 NH 3 + rotations by comparing results with A-site cations possessing different degrees of freedom, where the elimination of the rotational degree of freedom results in greater thermal conductivity by a factor of \u223c2 (20).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Using the cavity method of statistical physics and its relationship to belief propagation, we unveil a phase transition from a regime where we can infer the correct group assignments of the nodes to one where these groups are undetectable. Our approach yields an optimal inference algorithm for detecting modules, including both assortative and disassortative functional modules, assessing their significance, and learning the parameters of the underlying block model. Our algorithm is scalable and applicable to real-world networks, as long as they are well described by the block model. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt provides a useful playground for theoretical ideas and the analysis of algorithms, and is a popular model for functional modules in real networks. Using the cavity method developed in the physics of disordered systems [2,3] we exactly analyze the detectability of these modules in the limit of large sparse networks. As a function of the parameters, we compute the phase diagram and locate the associated phase transitions.We distinguish between a detectable phase where it is possible to learn the model's parameters and the group assignments of the nodes, and a non-intuitive undetectable phase where learning is impossible because the network's topology does not retain enough information about the original group memberships. The existence of a phase where a certain class of algorithms is unable to detect communities was previously predicted [4], but its location was only found approximately (and its size overestimated).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOur approach and our algorithm are easily generalized to other local generative models, and we will investigate its performance on a variety of real-world networks in the future.FIG. 2 :2FIG.2:(color online) The best possible overlap between the inferred and original group assignment.

A fundamental problem is to detect these communities and understand what role they play in the network's structure and dynamics. In social networks, these communities are often assortative, meaning that there is a higher density of connections within communities than between them, and many approaches to detecting these communities have been proposed (see e.g. [1]). In other networks, however, these modules may consist of nodes with few connections to each other, but which connect to the rest of the network in similar ways.In this Letter we analyze a random generative model for sparse modular networks, known as the stochastic block model.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Potential relationships are typically explored by modeling the network as a function of the nodal attributes or by modeling the attributes as a function of the network. These methods require specification of the exact nature of the association between the network and attributes, reduce the network data to a small number of summary statistics, and are unable provide predictions simultaneously for missing attribute and network information. Existing methods that model the attributes and network jointly also assume the data are fully observed. In this article we introduce a unified approach to analysis that addresses these shortcomings. We use a previously developed latent variable model to obtain a low dimensional representation of the network in terms of node-specific network factors. We introduce a novel testing procedure to determine if dependencies exist between the network factors and attributes as a surrogate for a test of dependence between the network and attributes. We also present a joint model for the network relations and attributes, for use if the hypothesis of independence is rejected, that can capture a variety of dependence patterns and be used to make inference and predictions for missing observations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe introduce a novel testing procedure to determine if dependencies exist between the network factors and attributes as a surrogate for a test of dependence between the network and attributes.

For example in recent years many studies in the social sciences have examined the relationship between individuals' friendship networks and their health measures, such as happiness, smoking and drinking behavior, and obesity (e.g. Veenstra et al. (2013) and references therein). Similarly in the biological sciences, scientists are interested in the relationship between how proteins interact and their biological importance (see Butland et al. (2005) for example). In each of these applications, parameter vector. The covariate vector x i,j typically includes terms for each attribute of the sender node i and receiver node j, as well as interaction terms measuring the similarity between the sender and receiver attributes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe first step in any such analysis is to formally test for dependencies between the network and attributes. In this section, we describe a novel, simple approach to performing such a test.A classical approach to determining whether there is an association between the nodal attributes X n\u00d7p and network relations Y n\u00d7n would be to test whether dependencies exist between X and the rows of Y or between X and the columns of Y. This would involve hypothesizing that each attribute is uncorrelated with each node's outgoing relations (H 0 : Cov(X[, i], Y [j,]) = 0 for all i,j) or incoming relations (H 0 : Cov(X[, i], Y [,j]) = 0 for all i,j) and investigating the evidence against these claims. However, conventional multivariate analysis tests are not applicable to these problems since these tests address relationships between p + n variables based on n observations. We propose an alternative testing approach using the the estimated latent network factors N n\u00d7(2k+2) = [a, b, U, V] from the network model in (1).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe improvement was greatest for male drinking frequency and female GPA where prediction mean squared error was reduced by about 15%. This illustrates that when dependence exists between the network and attributes, improvements in the predictions of missing values can be obtained by using both the network and attribute information.\nDiscussionIn this article we introduced an original approach to testing whether dependencies exist between a network and attribute data, and a joint modeling framework for the network and attributes, which relies on a simplified representation of the network in terms of latent nodespecific factors. As discussed in the Introduction, many others have proposed methodology for investigating the relationship between network and attribute data. The most common methods involve regressing either the network on functions of the nodal attributes or each node's attributes on functions of the attributes of the node's neighbors in the network. Frequently final models are settled upon after some, often undocumented, model selection procedure which not only alters the interpretation of the results, but also adds an additional element of subjectively to the analysis.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Though such a technology does not yet exist, the technical hurdles for fabricating minimally disruptive, solid-state electrical probes have arguably been overcome in the field of nanotechnology. Nanoscale devices can be patterned with features on the same length scale as biological components, and several groups have demonstrated that nanoscale electrical probes can measure the transmembrane potential of electrogenic cells. Developing these nascent technologies into robust intracellular recording tools will now require a better understanding of device-cell interactions, especially the membrane-inorganic interface. Here we review the state-of-the art in nanobioelectronics, emphasizing the characterization and design of stable interfaces between nanoscale devices and cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDesigning over orders of magnitudeEngineering the nanoscale interaction between cells and electrodes may be the fundamental challenge to massively parallel intracellular recordings, but a complete in vivo recording system presents additional technical obstacles. For instance, each recording site must transmit information out of the brain (>millimeters) to downstream electronics, which can become logistically challenging as the number and density of the electrodes increases. While up to 512 electrodes have been accommodated by flexible connectors [19], dramatically larger numbers of electrodes are probably to require multiplexing and/or wireless transmission. Electrode arrays of up to 26,400 electrodes have been achieved in vitro with multiplexing [96], but such a demonstration has yet to be achieved in vivo. Finally, electrode micromotions within the brain can disrupt the recording if the electrode moves relative to the cell [97]. Ideally the recording site could move independently from the rest of the electronics, such as a wireless device on the brain surface [98] or a soft physical tether to the outside world [19].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nActive mechanical stabilization has been used to correct the micromotion of rigid glass microelectrodes in vivo [97], but high density recordings will more probably rely on the compliance of flexible micro-wires or nanowires arrays [99,100] to passively decouple recordings sites from recording electronics. Such a design will be particularly important for awake recordings, where animal movement requires special attention to electrode stabilization [101]. Indeed, motivated by the difficulty of interfacing rigid structures with brain, there is much ongoing work adapting flexible electronic materials for use in neuroscience [102,103]. Flexibly tethered recordings present a different problem, however, as they cannot be delivered deep within the brain without the aid of a rigid shuttle [102,103] or other means of providing reversible rigidity during insertion [104,105].\nConclusionNanoscale devices show great promise for intracellular electrical recording and have indeed already been usedNanotechnology and neurophysiology Angle, Cui and Melosh 137 for specific applications such as electrophysiological phenotyping of IPSC-derived cardiac cells [86]. Stable, non-invasive intracellular electrical recording will require much more careful attention interactions between nanoscale devices and the cell membrane.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe remaining challenge is to demonstrate that these devices can be used over timescales relevant to neurophysiological experiments while preserving native cellular function. In the following sections we will examine the technical capabilities to produce nanoscale devices, the intrinsic electrical properties of these devices, and their specific interaction with cells. We conclude that the cell-electrode interaction is most crucial aspect of designing next-generation intracellular electrodes.\nThe nanoscale toolboxMany neuroscientists will already be aware of the exciting developments in field of bionanoelectronics, thanks in part to several existing reviews on the topic [29,30 ,31]. Nanoscale devices incorporating nanowires [32 ,33 ,34 ,35], nanotubes [36,37 ,38 ], and nanotransistors [37 ,39 ,40 ] have been used to record electrical activity from neurons and cardiomyocytes. This field draws upon a broad range of state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, which means that building and manipulating devices on subcellular length scales (<500 nm) is now routine, with some devices being patterned at the length-scale of single proteins [41,42 ].\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, most touch panels have been developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes. We demonstrate an ionic touch panel based on a polyacrylamide hydrogel containing lithium chloride salts. The panel is soft and stretchable, so it can sustain a large deformation. The panel can freely transmit light information because the hydrogel is transparent, with 98% transmittance for visible light. A surface-capacitive touch system was adopted to sense a touched position. The panel can be operated under more than 1000% areal strain without sacrificing its functionalities. Epidermal touch panel use on skin was demonstrated by writing words, playing a piano, and playing games. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1E), the parasitic capacitance of the strip increased because of the area expansion. Thus, the baseline current and the touching current both increased compared with that of the nonstretched states. In the stretched states, the currents also showed similar negative linear correlations with the interval of the electrode and the touch points. A 2D hydrogel panel was tested in order to detect the position of the touch point. As shown in Fig. 2, A andC, a thin hydrogel film, rectangular in shape, was connected to the Pt electrodes at each corner. Four current meters were also installed between the voltage source and each corner. Two normalized distances, a and b, were used to indicate the position of the touch on the panel. The bottom left corner of the panel corresponded to (a, b) = (0, 0), and the top right corner corresponded to (a, b) = (1, 1). When the panel is touched by a finger, it can be virtually divided into four resistive sections by the touch point (Fig. 2B).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe baseline current increased according to the stretch of the panel. However, the touching currents were insensitive to the stretching. (E) The A1 current was investigated for various touch points in a stretched state (l = 1.5).

(D) The position sensitivity after the attachment was tested by measuring the A1 currents at various touch points.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe prepared a circular touch panel with a diameter of 4 cm and a homemade biaxial stretcher (24), as shown in Fig. 3A. We glued the panel to the biaxial stretcher and connected the panel to the controller board via Pt electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3B, the diameter of the touch panel was enlarged after stretching up to 12.5 cm, which corresponded to 1000% areal strain. As shown in Fig. 3C, the touch panel can even be operated under highly stretched states. The related video clip is available in the supplementary materials (movie S2). The A1 currents of the touch panel at the undeformed and stretched states were measured with a touch point at the center in Fig. 3D. The baseline current increased from 6.68 to 9.16 mA, according to the stretch of the panel. The increase in the baseline current is suspected to be related to an expansion of the surface area of the gel panel (fig. S4), and the baseline current shows insensitivity to strain rate in the range of 0.2 to 1/min (fig. S5).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We thoroughly investigated temperature-dependent polarization, dielectric, and impedance spectroscopies, and we found no evidence of ferroelectric effect in a MAPbI3 thin film at normal operating conditions. Therefore, the effect does not contribute to the hysteresis in PSCs, whereas the large component of ionic migration observed may play a critical role. Our temperature-based polarization and dielectric studies find that MAPbI3 exhibits different electrical behaviors below and above ca. 45 \u00b0C, suggesting a phase transition around this temperature. In particular, we report the activation energies of ionic migration for the two phases and temperature-dependent permittivity of MAPbI3. This study contributes to the understanding of the material properties and device performance of hybrid perovskites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe temperature dependence of dielectric loss and conductivity (Fig. S9) also suggests a phase transition between 40 o C-50 o C.

Such a strong dependence of dielectric permittivity, particularly at low frequencies, is not a favorable sign of a ferroelectric nature of the material. At low frequencies, the value of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032 increases with temperature, whereas at high frequencies the trend is opposite but at a much smaller rate.

This further supports the lack of a ferroelectric feature observed in MAPbI3 thin films in the polarization studies. Moreover, two different regions, below 40 o C and above 50 o C, can be observed,\nthe ionic migration effects are modelled as a series RionCion branch in parallel to the electronic processes. The series Cion is used to model the contact blocking of mobile ions. The geometric and chemical capacitances (excluding ionic effects) are represented by Cbulk. The fitting curves to the original measurements are shown in Fig. S10. After plotting the various ionic and electronic elements of the equivalent circuit against temperature, we observed a clear change of Rion and Re resistivity as shown in Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe dielectric loss \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032\u2032 shows a 1/f behavior for frequencies below a few kHz, following the so-called Jonscher's law, which accurately reveals the ionic conductivity of the material. 39,40 As temperature increases, a small and wide shoulder (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 4b) begins to appear and shifts toward higher frequency with temperature. Such a behavior is typical for relaxation processes, found in the generic Debye expression of permitivity. 37 Considering the low frequency and broad peak feature, this relaxation process could be a Maxwell-Wagner type interfacial polarization relaxation, possibly attributed to grain boundary effects or blocking at the contacts. The dielectric loss tangent of the material was found to be high at lower frequencies, especially at lower temperature. The peak value of loss tangent shifts toward higher frequency as the temperature is increased (~1 Hz for 10 o C to ~200Hz for 70 o C). Moreover, the loss tangent starts increasing with temperature at >100 Hz, and below this frequency the loss tangent decreases with increasing temperature.

This study presents the large-scale features of the simulated climates and compares the new model results to those of the atmospheric models from the first phase of the PMIP, for which sea surface temperature was prescribed or computed using simple slab ocean formulations. We consider the large-scale features of the climate change, pointing out some of the major differences between the different sets of experiments. We show in particular that systematic differences between PMIP1 and PMIP2 simulations are due to the interactive ocean, such as the amplification of the African monsoon at the Mid-Holocene or the change in precipitation in mid-latitudes at the LGM. Also the PMIP2 simulations are in general in better agreement with data than PMIP1 simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMid-HoloceneChanges are modest compared to those of the LGM, but reflect the sensitivity of the climate system to changes in the mean seasonal cycle of insolation. In particular, there is nearly no simulated change in annual mean temperature or precipitation for the Mid-Holocene, consistent with no change in global annual mean insolation. The major changes for this period compared to present correspond to an enhanced (reduced) seasonal cycle of temperature in the NH (SH). The continental warming favours the deepening of the JJAS thermal low over land, which intensifies the low level    winds and moisture transport from the tropical ocean to the continent, and thereby intensifies monsoon system in the tropical regions (Kutzbach et al., 1993;Joussaume et al., 1999).All models simulate an amplification of the mean seasonal cycle of NH surface temperature. In summer, this is characterised by increased surface air temperature over NH continents and in mid and high latitudes over the ocean and the Arctic (Fig. 6). The continental warming reaches a maximum of about 2 \u2022 C in central Eurasia and over the Tibetan Plateau in the PMIP2 simulations (Fig. 6a).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese changes are very similar to the results found from PMIP1 SSTf and SSTc experiments, which suggests that the dominant factors contributing to the drying is the large-scale cooling which contribute to reduce evaporation over the tropical ocean, and the reduction of the inland moisture transport.For the Mid-Holocene, the new results confirm that the response of the ocean and sea-ice shape the changes in the seasonal cycle of the surface air temperature and precipitation. The sea-ice has a large effect in high latitudes, and in particular in the NH where its reduction during boreal summer strengthens the warming. In the tropical regions, the monsoons are enhanced both over West Africa and over the north of India. Comparison with data shows that the coupled simulations better reproduce the change in precipitation over west Africa, even though the amount of precipitation is still underestimated in most simulations and would not sustain steppe as far as 23 \u2022 N. It also shows that the ocean feedback strengthens the monsoon amplification over Africa and damps it over India. Vegetation feedbacks enhance the signal in some models, but reduce it in others.Common features emerge from the comparison of the two time periods.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFigureFigure 1. 10\nFig. 10 .10Fig. 10.

We demonstrate that in space-charge limited diodes the hole mobility (micro(h)) of a large variety of organic semiconductors shows a universal Arrhenius temperature dependence micro(h)(T) = micro(0)exp(-Delta/kT) at low fields, due to the presence of extrinsic carriers from the Ohmic contact. The transport in a range of organic semiconductors, with a variation in room temperature mobility of more than 6 orders of magnitude, is characterized by a universal mobility micro(0) of 30-40 cm(2)/V s. As a result, we can predict the full temperature dependence of their charge transport properties with only the mobility at one temperature known. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFurthermore, in order to explain the observed electric field dependence within this Gaussian disorder model an additional spatial correlated potential for the charge carriers is needed, which could arise from charge-dipole interactions [6]. However, in contrast to the empirical relation Eq. ( 1) the simulations showed a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the mobility at low fields, given by / exp \u00ff 2=3kT 2 , where is the width of the Gaussian DOS [5].Recently, also the dependence of h on the carrier density in a PPV derivative has been investigated by a combined study on polymeric diodes and field-effect transistors [8]. It has been demonstrated that the hole mobility is constant for charge carrier densities typically <10 22 m \u00ff3 and increases with a power law with density for carrier densities >10 22 m \u00ff3 . In contrast to the earlier assumption [4] the enhancement of the mobility at higher voltages in SCL diodes at room temperature has been shown to be totally due to the increase of the carrier density instead of the electric field [9]. However, at lower temperatures the field dependence of the mobility becomes increasingly more important.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor sufficiently high densities [Fig. 1(b)], meaning E f > E eq , it has been demonstrated by Coehoorn that also within the Gaussian disorder model the transport is governed by an Arrhenius-like ln / 1=T behavior [12], as often observed in organic transistors [13,14]. Experimentally, the question whether the transport in organic semiconductors is better described by a ln / 1=T 2 or ln / 1=T [Eq. ( 1)] behavior has been addressed by Borsenberger et al. [15]. From time-of-flight (TOF) measurements on vapor-deposited 1,1-bis(di-4tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane they convincingly demonstrated that the non-Arrhenius ln / 1=T 2 provides a more consistent description of the charge transport. However, in the analysis of various charge transport measurements an important aspect has been ignored: in TOF studies thick samples ( > 1 m) are used with blocking contacts to prevent charge injection.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe solid line is the prediction made from Eq. ( 4). The good agreement for semiconductors that differ by 6 orders of magnitude in h 0; 300 K shows the validity of the Arrhenius-like transport in all of these SCL diodes.In conclusion, we demonstrate that the mobilities of a variety of organic semiconductors are consistent with an Arrhenius temperature dependent transport with a universal prefactor 0 30 cm 2 =V s. The carriers diffusing into the diodes from the Ohmic contact lift the Fermi level above the equilibrium level, resulting in an Arrheniuslike temperature dependence instead of the characteristic ln h 1=T 2 behavior as observed for blocking contacts. As a result, the temperature dependence of the charge transport can be predicted when the mobility at one single temperature is known.   I).

We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems there appears a gapless phase between the QSH and insulator phases in 3D which is in contrast with the 2D case. Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless points (diabolical points) in 3D, but not in 2D. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe present one example. In [7], we constructed a fourband tight-binding model for HgTe. It is a zero-gap system, but by opening a gap with uniaxial pressure, it becomes a band insulator. The question here is whether it is a simple insulator or a topological insulator (i.e. QSH). In fact, from the parities of the bands below the Fermi energy E F from the four-band model in [7], the Z 2 topological number \u03bd turns out to be even. This disagrees with the result in [18]. The reason for the disagreement is the following. This model only has four bands near the Fermi energy E F , and the other bands well below E F are discarded. In HgTe, one doubly-degenerate band just below the Fermi energy has a trivial Z 2 topological number, while the other discarded bands deep below the Fermi energy have a nontrivial Z 2 topological number; this leads to the seemingly contradicting results.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe two (doubly-degenerate) bands will touch when a i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , 5, which are not satisfied by tuning only one parameter m. (Note that the wavenumber k is fixed here and cannot be changed.) Thus, it is impossible to control the bands to touch at k = G/2 by tuning a single parameter m.\nI-symmetric systems.In I-symmetric systems, the energies are doubly degenerate for every k by the Kramers theorem. The phase transition occurs when the gap between the two doubly-degenerate bands closes at some k. Because there are four states involved, we consider the 4\u00d74 Hamiltonian matrix H (k). We impose the I-symmetry asH (-k) = P H (k)P -1 , u(-k) = Pu(k), (10)where P is a unitary matrix independent of k, and u(k) is the periodic part of the Bloch wavefunction: \u03d5 k (r) = u(k)e ik\u2022r .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is defined in the similar way as the Chern integer [12], but with some modification. From this definition, it follows that the Z 2 topological number in 2D can change when the valence and conduction bands touch each other at some k = \u00b1k 0 . (The band touching occurs simultaneously at k = \u00b1k 0 because of the T-symmetry.) In 2D, the effective Hamiltonian in the vicinity of the phase transition reduces toH = E 0 (m, k x , k y ) \u00b1 (m -m 0 )\u03c3 z + (k x -k x0 )\u03c3 x + (k y -k y0 )\u03c3 y ,(5)after unitary and scale transformations, where m is an external parameter which controls the phase transition [19]. Equation ( 5) describes the simplest and general case for the band crossing, which occurs at (m,k x , k y ) = (m 0 , k x0 , k y0 ).This story should be modified when the spatial dimension is three, especially for Iasymmetric systems.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We identify signatures of this Weyl point in the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states, observable in thermodynamic properties. Tunneling between the electron and hole pockets in a magnetic field is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p-n junction in real space. This magnetic breakdown happens at a characteristic field strength that vanishes when the Fermi level approaches the Weyl point. The topological distinction between connected and disconnected pairs of type-II Weyl cones can be distinguished by the qualitatively different dependence of the quantum oscillations on the direction of the magnetic field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1). Here we investigate how this process, a momentum space manifestation of Klein tunneling [22], affects the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states (de Haas-van Alphen effect), providing a unique thermodynamic signature of the topologically protected band structure (an alternative to proposed transport signatures [9,[23][24][25]). Because the quantum oscillations are governed by extremal cross sections of the Fermi surface, one might wonder whether some symmetry is required to align the extremal cross section with the Weyl point, so that it becomes observable. Our analysis shows that a magnetic field axis for this alignment exists generically, because of the M\u00f6bius strip topology of the projective plane. We first consider Klein tunneling through a single type-II Weyl point, and then turn to pairs of Weyl cones of opposite helicity, which can be combined in topologically distinct ways [8]-with a qualitatively different dependence on the Klein tunneling probability.To first order in momentum k, the Hamiltonian of a Weyl cone has the generic form Tunneling between the pockets happens with a probability T that tends to unity when their minimal separation \u0394k \u2192 0.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nKlein tunneling is a powerful diagnostic for such topologically distinct Fermi surfaces.FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1.

Because of the high structural and chemical variability of polymers that can be created by synthetic approaches, thin films composed of polymers are especially useful in creating a wide range of stimuli-responsive structures. Moreover, since polymer thin films can be patterned by a number of planar techniques such as photolithography, molding, or imprinting, a variety of precisely patterned 2D precursors can be used to fold-up functional structures such as tubular, spherical and polyhedral capsules, biomimetic actuators and even microsurgical tools.

Moreover, the design focus in these materials is on manipulating the molecular architecture and chain flexibility which can be realized in response to only a limited number of stimuli.\nDesign principlesIn order to create a self-folding structure using thin films, it is necessary to engineer differential stress either along its thickness or lateral dimensions so that a bending moment is generated. An illustration of a proposed schematic for the bending response of a leaf (Figure 1C) suggests that even a differentially swelling well-adhered bilayer would cause bending, and this is indeed the case. The important thin film design principles that are compatible with photopatterning and can be utilized to create stimuli responsive self-folding polymeric materials are schematically illustrated in Figure 2.\nPolymer bilayersA straightforward strategy to create a stimuli responsive self-folding structure is to utilize bilayers wherein either one or both layers are polymers (Figure 2A).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Numerous studies have detected significant changes in the observed occurrence of extreme heat events, irrespective of how such events are defined. Further, a number of these studies have attributed present-day changes in the risk of individual heat events and the documented global-scale increase in such events to anthropogenic-driven warming. Advances in process-based studies of heat events have focused on the proximate land-atmosphere interactions through soil moisture anomalies, and changes in occurrence of the underlying atmospheric circulation associated with heat events in the midlatitudes. While evidence for a number of hypotheses remains limited, climate change nevertheless points to tail risks of possible changes in heat extremes that could exceed estimates generated from model outputs of mean temperature. We also explore risks associated with compound extreme events and nonlinear impacts associated with extreme heat. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNote that the two mechanisms are active areas of research, and as such their theoretical basis in either the observed or future climate is not established. However, the two hypotheses would be consistent with nonlinear increases in extreme heat events. Furthermore, the hypotheses complement one another as both account for reduced summer weather variability at synoptic time scales, and there is some evidence that both are occurring in boreal summer [21].\n\"Resonant\" Circulation RegimesPlanetary wave influence on midlatitude weather in all seasons is a topic of active research. In the boreal midlatitude summer, amplifying interactions among standing (quasistationary) Rossby waves and fast-moving (free) Rossby waves of similar wavenumber (e.g., 6-8) have been proposed as being critical in producing long-standing heatwaves and other extreme events [17,18,20,21,23,37,44]. This \"quasi-resonance\" of Rossby waves is associated with a double jet stream that traps Rossby waves within a latitudinal band, or waveguide [17,21,45].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHow well does persistence associated with the large-scale dynamical mechanisms explain heat wave evolution, relative to the predictions associated with existing, more localized, theories of heat wave evolution (e.g., Miralles et al. [32])? While only representing a single model and location, the analysis of Teng et al. [54] of projected heatwaves over the Great Plains is important because it partitioned both planetary wave and land surface factors, concluding that only the latter could explain projected increases in heat waves there.The question of causation of any changes in midlatitude dynamics is even more challenging. Changes in the summer midlatitudes and Arctic may share a common mechanism, perhaps in the tropics (e.g., Ding et al. [55]). Petoukhov et al. [17] and Hoskins and Woolings [40]   [17], based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis that subtleties in the subtropical jet-which a priori are more driven by the tropics than the Arctic-are critical to quasiresonance.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAmplified mid-latitude planetary waves favour particular regional weather extremes\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJAScreen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tISimmonds\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/NCLIMATE2271\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat Clim Chang\n\t\t\n\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tExploring recent trends in Northern Hemisphere blocking\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEABarnes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEDunn-Sigouin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGMasato\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTWoollings\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1002/2013GL058745\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGeophys Res Lett\n\t\t\n\t\t\t41\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tProbability of US heat waves affected by a subseasonal planetary wave pattern\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHTeng\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGBranstator\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGAMeehl\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWMWashington\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1038/ngeo1988\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNat Geosci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2013\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The interface quality is found to be strongly affected by the perovskite deposition procedure, and in particular from the environment where the conversion of the starting precursors into the final perovskite is performed (air, nitrogen, or vacuum). The conversion efficiency of the precursors into the hybrid perovskite layer is compared between the different solar cells by looking at the ToF-SIMS intensities of the characteristic molecular fragments from the perovskite and the precursor materials. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the STEM confirms the macroscopic ToF-SIMS findings and allows elemental mapping with nanometer resolution. Clear evidence for iodine diffusion has been observed and related to the fabrication procedure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIncomplete perovskite infiltration can be seen in samples A and D.

The signal from PbCl -is found to be very low and fairly constant, indicating that the PbCl 2 precursor is almost absent. In sample A (Figure 7a), the perovskite layer is very compact, The strong decrease in R A within the perovskite layer indicates that the perovskite formation is inhomogeneous with a more efficient conversion at the bottom part of the perovskite layer, while more Pb X I Y species are present at the interface with the HTM not bound into the perovskite structure. In sample B, R B is fairly stable within the perovskite layer, indicating an efficient and homogeneous perovskite conversion which well fits with the high PCE values. The raise of R B indicated some iodine diffusion toward the HTM. In sample C, similarly to sample B, R C displays a constant value in the perovskite layer.\nCONCLUSIONSThis work has explored in detail the morphology, composition, and interfaces in PSCs deposited by different methodologies and external conditions by combining multiple advanced characterization tools.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPerovskite Conversion Efficiency. Composition analysis with EDX, XPS, and ToF-SIMS have revealed iodine diffusion leading to an inhomogeneous lead/iodine ratio, with marked composition differences between in the capping perovskite layer and the one embedded into the mesoporous TiO 2 layer. It is then crucial to establish whether the constituent elements of the perovskite are present in the desired perovskite form (i.e., CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) or in other forms (PbI 3 or PbI 2 , etc.) as this would allow to compare the perovskite conversion efficiency associated with the each conversion method and environment and determine ionic diffusion testified by the presence of strong signals from iodine fragments.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Geochronological tests of this hypothesis have been limited by a dearth of reliable age constraints bracketing these events on multiple cratons. Here we present four new Re-Os geochronology age constraints on Sturtian (717\u2013660 Ma) and Marinoan (635 Ma termination) glacial deposits from three different paleocontinents. A 752.7 \u00b1 5.5 Ma age from the base of the Callison Lake Formation in Yukon, Canada, confirms nonglacial sedimentation on the western margin of Laurentia between ca. 753 and 717 Ma. Coupled with a new 727.3 \u00b1 4.9 Ma age directly below the glacigenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate on the Congo craton (Africa), these data refute the notion of a global ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. A 659.0 \u00b1 4.5 Ma age directly above the Maikhan-Uul diamictite in Mongolia confirms previous constraints on a long duration for the 717\u2013660 Ma Sturtian glacial epoch and a relatively short nonglacial interlude. In addition, we provide the first direct radiometric age constraint for the termination of the Marinoan glaciation in Laurentia with an age of 632.3 \u00b1 5.9 Ma from the basal Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada, which is identical, within uncertainty, to U-Pb zircon ages from China, Australia, and Namibia.

The widespread occurrence of lowlatitude glacial deposits on every paleocontinent, coupled with the unique geochemistry and sedimentology of cap carbonates (Hoffman et al., 1998;Bao et al., 2008), inspired the snowball Earth hypothesis (Kirschvink, 1992). However, the general paucity of radiometric age constraints from multiple paleocontinents for the onset and demise of Cryogenian glaciations (Sturtian ca. 717-660 Ma, and Marinoan ending ca. 635 Ma), as well as reports of putative pre-Sturtian glaciations (Frimmel et al., 1996), has fostered doubts about the synchronicity and global extent of these events (e.g., Allen and Etienne, 2008;Kendall et al., 2006).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCONCLUSIONThe four Re-Os ages presented herein help refi ne our current Neoproterozoic chronology. These data refute the evidence for an earlier global Kaigas glaciation and suggest instead that the initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch ca. 717 Ma marked the fi rst unambiguous glacial event in more than a billion years. Together with existing geochronological data, the new Re-Os ages constrain the onset and demise of the long-lasting (717-660 Ma) Sturtian glacial epoch and further bolster correlations for the end-Cryogenian Marinoan glaciation ca. 635 Ma (Fig. 3). The long duration (>55 m.y.) of the Sturtian glacial epoch implies a relatively short Cryogenian nonglacial interlude (<25 m.y.), consistent with a repeated trigger for glaciation related to the tectonic background conditions that drive weathering and the consumption of CO 2 on 1-10 m.y. time scales (Mills et al., 2011).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n753 and 717 Ma. Coupled with a new 727.3 \u00b1 4.9 Ma age directly below the glacigenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate on the Congo craton (Africa), these data refute the notion of a global ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. A 659.0 \u00b1 4.5 Ma age directly above the Maikhan-Uul diamictite in Mongolia confi rms previous constraints on a long duration for the 717-660 Ma Sturtian glacial epoch and a relatively short nonglacial interlude. In addition, we provide the fi rst direct radiometric age constraint for the termination of the Marinoan glaciation in Laurentia with an age of 632.3 \u00b1 5.9 Ma from the basal Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada, which is identical, within uncertainty, to U-Pb zircon ages from China, Australia, and Namibia. Together, these data unite Re-Os and U-Pb geochronological constraints and provide a refi ned temporal framework for Cryogenian Earth history.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nINTRODUCTIONAfter more than one billion years without robust evidence of glaciation, Cryogenian (ca.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A total of 274 sequences were analyzed and assigned 48.00% Proteobacteria, 10.30% Actinobacteria, 9.90% Bacteroidetes, 6.60% Verrucomicrobia, 4.80% Acidobacteria, 1.80% Firmicutes, 1.50% Chloroflexi, 1.50% TM7, 1.10% Deinococcus-Thermus, 0.70% Planctomycetes, 0.70% Gemmatimonadetes and 0.40% Cyanobacteria. Economically important phyla Actinobacteria was second most dominant group after Proteobacteria, in our clone library. It would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. An additional 12.8% of clone library (35 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) from 43 clones) with less than 94% similarity to any GenBank sequence could not be assigned to any known phylum and may represent unidentified bacterial lineages and suggests that a large amount of the rhizobacterial diversity remains to be characterized by culturing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria. Cloned 16S rRNA genes affiliated with Pseudomonas were also infrequently recovered from rhizosphere soil samples [30].Pseudoxanthomonas has been known to use as bioremediation as reported earlier by Sanchez et al. [31]. Most interestingly, the economically important phyla Actinobacteria was the second dominant group in our clone library, and among most dominant OTUs with 5 clone sequences was close relative of genera Streptomyces. This genera is of economical importance because of its antibiotic producing ability. Streptomyces, act as antagonists to many different phytopathogenic fungi, detection of chitinolytic activity of Actinomycetes also makes them promising candidates as biocontrol agents for diverse fungal diseases. Presence of phyla Actinobacteria in the rhizosphere opens the possibility of exploring them to identify members with antagonistic properties toward some economically hazardous plant pathogens. An important decomposer of plant matter in the soil, this phylum has previously been shown to be abundant in some of these soils by culture-dependent and independent techniques [32].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever extra data are necessary, to prove occurrence of new phylotypes, as only a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed.The observation that sequences related to Proteobacteria phylum made up the largest fraction of clone library in this study is consistent with previous findings that the phylum Proteobacteria, which is metabolically versatile and genetically diverse, comprises the largest frac-  tion of the bacterial community in soil ecosystems, including the rhizosphere [26]. The representation of genera Devosia is interesting as, previously these genera have been detected as a nitrogen fixing nodule former in Neptunia natans (L.f.) Druce [27], other dominant phylotypes were relatives of well known genera Rhizobium/ Mesorhizobium/ Rhodoplanes. 16S rRNA gene fragments related to Rhizobium was also recovered from maize roots and it was noted that pea was grown in the field site prior to maize cultivation [28]. It is also possible that Rhizobium is a native member of non-legume rhizospheres [29]. Pseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. Likewise bacteria within the Bacteroidetes are known to be chemoorganotrophic and especially proficient in degrading various polymers and complex substrates in media such as cellulose, chitin, and pectin [33]. It has been reported earlier that the members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia have been shown to make up 1 to 10% of the bacterial 16S rRNA in soils, although most members of this phylum remains uncultivated. Some members of this group are among the most successful human pathogens, others are abundant soil microbes, and others still are of major importance for the marine nitrogen cycle and hold much promise for sustainable wastewater treatment [34]. In the maize rhizosphere 10 OTUs belong to phylum Acidobacteria were related to uncul-tured bacteria.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Such approaches have been recently proposed and applied to improve plant and animal health [citation 64].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Artificial ecosystem selection \nAbstract: Artificial selection has been practiced for centuries to shape the properties of individual organisms, providing Darwin with a powerful argument for his theory of natural selection. We show that the properties of whole ecosystems can also be shaped by artificial selection procedures. Ecosystems initiated in the laboratory vary phenotypically and a proportion of the variation is heritable, despite the fact that the ecosystems initially are composed of thousands of species and millions of individuals. Artificial ecosystem selection can be used for practical purposes, illustrates an important role for complex interactions in evolution, and challenges a widespread belief that selection is most effective at lower levels of the biological hierarchy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInoculation of microcosms, planting, and harvesting were carried out under sterile conditions so as to minimize contamination of the microcosms.Two sets of high and low lines were initiated in which the size of the soil inoculum differed by two orders of magnitude (6.0 g vs. 0.06 g). Each line consisted of 15 units and the 3 units with the highest (or lowest) value of the phenotypic trait were used as parents by combining the soil from the 3 units into a slurry that was used to inoculate the ''offspring'' generation of units. Fifteen microcosms per generation for the high and low treatments of the 6.0-g and 0.06-g inoculum sizes and two control treatments led to a total of 90 microcosms per generation for the complete experiment, which was continued for 16 35-day ecosystem generations. In generations 1 through 9, we ran sterile control treatments to serve as baselines that consisted of high and low selection lines inoculated with autoclaved 6.0-g slurries.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt has many practical applications and encourages us to look for a similar process of natural ecosystem selection. The main reason that it has not been attempted before seems to be conceptual. Perhaps because it was regarded as theoretically implausible, it simply didn't occur to biologists to look for heritable phenotypic variation at the level of ecosystems, which allows their properties to be shaped by standard artificial selection procedures.This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant DEB-9707650 to D.S.W. and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Biological Sciences grant to R.E.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

Although the revolution in DNA sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic-level information, the biogeography of microbiomes is almost entirely uncharted at the micron scale. Using spectral imaging fluorescence in situ hybridization as guided by metagenomic sequence analysis, we have discovered a distinctive, multigenus consortium in the microbiome of supragingival dental plaque. The consortium consists of a radially arranged, nine-taxon structure organized around cells of filamentous corynebacteria. The consortium ranges in size from a few tens to a few hundreds of microns in radius and is spatially differentiated. Within the structure, individual taxa are localized at the micron scale in ways suggestive of their functional niche in the consortium. For example, anaerobic taxa tend to be in the interior, whereas facultative or obligate aerobes tend to be at the periphery of the consortium. Consumers and producers of certain metabolites, such as lactate, tend to be near each other. Based on our observations and the literature, we propose a model for plaque microbiome development and maintenance consistent with known metabolic, adherence, and environmental considerations. The consortium illustrates how complex structural organization can emerge from the micron-scale interactions of its constituent organisms. The understanding that plaque community organization is an emergent phenomenon offers a perspective that is general in nature and applicable to other microbiomes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWith deep sequencing, it has become clear that many taxa in the oral microbiota are shared across individuals but are abundant in some samples and almost vanishingly rare in others (19,38). These differences in abundance may result from real differences between individuals, fluctuations within a single individual over time, or a combination of the two. Whatever its cause, the lack of a consistently abundant microbial \"core\" has led to the idea that perhaps it is not organisms but genes and functions that are conserved within the microbiome, distributed across a variety of organisms whose identities are irrelevant. The discovery of hedgehog consortia argues against this idea, at least for some microbiomes. The consistency of the composition and structure of the hedgehog across many individuals suggests that organisms are highly relevant to understanding the roles, organization, and dynamics of the members of the consortium. We suggest that it is neither necessary nor desirable to disregard taxonomy and reduce the microbiome to a collection of genes or metabolites unmoored from their source organism.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis model synthesizes in vitro and in vivo observations to make testable predictions about the spatial structure of mature dental plaque, but a direct test of the model by highresolution imaging has not previously been undertaken.The study of microbial communities has been revolutionized by metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches, which have\nSignificanceThe physiology and ecology of complex microbial communities are strongly dependent on the immediate surroundings of each microbe, including the identity of neighboring microbes; however, information on the micron-scale organization of microbiomes is largely lacking. Using sequencing data combined with spectral fluorescence imaging, we have discovered a multigenus, highly organized microbial consortium in human dental plaque. The spatial structure of the consortium reveals unanticipated interactions and provides a framework for understanding the organization, metabolism, and systems biology of the microbiome and ultimately, its effect on the health of the human host. Our synthesis of high-throughput sequencing data with spatial and structural information shows the informative value of microbial biogeography at the micron scale.revealed enormous complexity (10). However, the groundbreaking methods that revealed the complexity have the drawback that the sample must be homogenized for nucleic acid extraction, thereby destroying any spatial structure at the micron scale that might have existed.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt seems likely that Corynebacterium finds attachment sites on the preexisting biofilm consisting of Streptococcus and Actinomyces, which are among the early colonizers (33) and can be found near the base of hedgehog structures. EM examination of the microbial community colonizing removable enamel chips worn inside the mouth showed scattered filamentous cells oriented perpendicularly to the primarily coccus-covered surface at 24 hours and a mixed community of abundant filamentous organisms by 48 hours (39), suggesting that colonization with Corynebacterium may take place around the 24-hour stage in plaque development. In the subgingival crevice or within the dental calculus that precipitates around these filamentous aggregates (40), the attachment sites of Corynebacterium would be protected, and when distal portions of the structure are lost, by abrasion or oral hygiene procedures similar to our sampling methods, the filaments could rapidly regrow from these reservoirs.Understanding Microbiomes: Genes Vs.

Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) ) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2 -eq. yr(-1) ), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n), which was evaluated by assuming that demand reduction would linearly reduce all flows. As Table 2 shows, the combination of all measures results in a substantial reduction in cropland and grazing areas, even though the individual measures cannot be added up due to the interactions between the individual compartments shown in Fig. 1, and regional disparities considered in the biomass-balance model (Erb et al., 2012a,b).In all cases, former agricultural land (i.e. cropland plus grazing land area) would become available for nonfood purposes (afforestation or bioenergy crops) if stocking densities on grazing land were increased to higher, but still sustainable, levels; the latter were derived from spatially explicit data on the productivity of grazing areas (see Erb et al., 2009Erb et al., , 2012a,b;,b;Haberl et al., 2011). Table 2 shows the GHG reductions that could be achieved in 2050 by using the spare land for afforestation, assuming a CO 2 sequestration of 11.8 t CO 2 eq ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (based on Smith et al., 2000).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSuch options reduce demand for land, but there may be trade-offs with other ecological, social and economic costs (IAASTD, 2009) that need to be mitigated (Tilman et al., 2011). Increases in yields may also increase consumption (Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011;Erb et al., 2012a,b;Rose et al., 2013), and cause local and regional land expansion, as technological improvements and productivity gains potentially also make agricultural activity more profitable and thus more attractive (Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011;Rose et al., 2013).

Introduction [2] Human land use activities are a force of global significance [Foley et al., 2005]. Humans have extensively modified the Earth's land surface, altering ecosystem structure and functioning, and diminishing the ability of ecosystems to continue providing valuable resources such as food, freshwater and forest resources, and services such as regulation of climate, air quality, water quality, soil resources.[3] Agricultural activities, in particular, have been responsible for a vast majority of these land use related ecosystem consequences [Richards, 1990;Tilman et al., 2001;Green et al., 2005].\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[34] Our final predicted cropland extent of 15.0 million km 2 in year 2000 amounts to roughly 12% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), and pasture extent of 28.0 million km 2 amounts to 22% of global land area. Thus humans are using 34% of the global land area for their agricultural needs.\nGeographic Distribution of Croplands and Pastures in Year 2000[35] We analyzed the distribution of agricultural regions by 14 different regions of the world (Table 5). The greatest proportion of croplands in the world are found in South Asia, Europe, Southeast Asia, and United States, east of the Mississippi, while the greatest proportion of pastures are found in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, Pacific developed countries, China, Mexico and Central America, United States, west of the Mississippi, and tropical Africa. The smallest proportion of croplands are found in Canada, the Pacific developed Countries, and northern South America, while the smallest proportion of pastures are found in Southeast Asia, Canada, and United States, east of the Mississippi.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nResults\nTotal Global Area of Croplands and Pastures in 2000[32] Our final results (Figure 6) indicate that there were 15.0 (95% confidence range of 12.2-17.1) million km 2 of crop-land and 28.0 (95% confidence range of 23.6-30.0) million km 2 of pasture in the world in the year 2000. This compares to 15.3 million km 2 of cropland and 34.4 million km 2 of pasture reported by the FAOSTAT database. Thus we predict significantly lower extent of pasture (by 6.1 million km 2 or $18% lower) than reported by FAO.

Still, there is evidence of an \u201cemerging supermarket revolution in India\u201d [citation 37], driven by domestic capital.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Surprised by supermarkets: Diffusion of modern food retail in India \nAbstract: Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the patterns and dynamics of the diffusion of modern food retail in India.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper is based on detailed sales data from retail chains in India, short case studies of retail chains, and review of literature.\nFindings\nThe article presents three surprises concerning modern food retail diffusion in India. First, modern retail has developed in three \u201cwaves\u201d, with the first wave, government retail chains, starting in the 1960s/1970s, cooperative retail chains starting in the 1970s/1980s, and private retail chains in the 1990s/2000s. All three were substantial, and internationally uniquely, all three coexist in the 2000s as segments of modern retail. Second, the rise of modern private retail in India in the past six years has been among the fastest in the world, growing at 49 percent a year on average over that period, and bouncing back to growth after a dip from the recent recession. The great majority of modern private retail has arisen in 2007\u20102010. Third, beside the uniqueness of the coexistence of three types of retail noted above, Indian private retail chain development has unique or rare characteristics: driven by domestic capital investment, \u201cearly\u201d (in terms of usual international patterns) diversification into small formats, \u201cearly\u201d penetration of small cities and even rural towns, of the food markets of the poor and lower\u2010middle class, and of fresh produce retail. These unique factors have helped to propel it quickly.\nOriginality/value\nFor the first time in the literature, the paper presents an analysis of: the three waves in Indian retail; detailed sales data for all leading chains; and its uniqueness. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUnlike what occurred in Southeast Asia in the 1990s, many of the leading India retail chains pronounced forcefully in favor of retail FDI liberalization and sought partners to add to their operations the set of distribution FDI activities that were already permitted (by mid 2000s). The press and retail meetings and actions and pronouncements of retailers summed up to Indian retailers actively seeking MNC partners, preparing for the day that FDI is liberalized and the \"race gates open.\" The eventual entry in the past several years of Metro, Wal-mart, Tesco, Booker, and recently Carrefour, as wholesalers, including as partners of domestic chains (such as Wal-mart with Bharti) further fueled the speculation that retailers were jostling to position for the liberalization, as well as use the FDI relations allowed to maximize their partnering with MNCs. The MNCs presence may have also increased overall expertise in the sector, if only with the frequent moves of executives from one firm to another.Despite the rapid growth of retail we show in Section 3, and the strong drivers noted above, several constraints were present.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNote that that 5-6 percent estimate is lower than the share of all modern retail -which includes also the government and cooperative chains, which might make the share half or more again as much.4. Third surprise: private-retail revolution with unique Indian characteristics Various characteristics, especially of the second phase of the third wave -the private retail chain boom -are surprising, both to India, and about India compared with the past two decades of developing country modern retail diffusion. The essence of the differences is twofold. First, India has done what few other developing countries have done: started a supermarket revolution with domestic capital without relying at first on the push from retail FDI. Second, India has done what most other developing countries have done -but done them \"earlier\" (in the evolution of modern retail in the country), more simultaneously, more experimentally, more variously. We lay out the surprising differences below.\nPrimarily domestic investmentIt is common for domestic (family company) capital to be important in the earliest stages of supermarket development in developing countries, but for the \"take-off\" some sector well-endowed with capital steps in and drives the investment.\n\nExcerpt 3: \non Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) In Multi-Brand Retail Trading, Government of India\n\t\t\n\t\t\t158\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010. 2.

We then discuss the energetics, structural evolution, and variations in electronic and mechanical properties of crystalline and amorphous Li\u2013M alloys. Our calculations show that Li insertion is the least favorable in Si and the most favorable in Sn owing to its large effective interstitial space and softer matrix. Upon Li incorporation, the bonding strength of the host network is weakened, attributed to the transferred charge from Li. Li interstitials can migrate easily in all three host materials with a moderate migration barrier in Si and small barriers in Ge and Sn. Because of the cation repulsive interaction, Li atoms tend to remain isolated and well dispersed in M; also induced by this cationic nature is the charge redistribution toward Li, leading to the strong screening/shielding effect in Si, in which the excess charges are highly localized, and a relatively weaker effect in Sn. According to our mixing enthalpy calculations, alloying between Li and M is energetically favorable with Li\u2013Sn alloys being the most stable, followed by Li\u2013Ge and Li\u2013Si alloys. On the basis of structural, electronic, and mechanical property analyses, we also demonstrate how the incorporation of Li atoms with increasing concentration leads to the disintegration of host networks and softening of the Li\u2013M alloys, and associated with the more flexible lattices, the volume expansion at fully lithiated states are 434 (399)% (Si), 382 (353)% (Ge), and 305 (259)% (Sn) for amorphous (crystalline) Li\u2013M alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOn the basis of structural, electronic, and mechanical property analyses, we also demonstrate how the incorporation of Li atoms with increasing concentration leads to the disintegration of host networks and softening of the Li\u00c0M alloys, and associated with the more flexible lattices, the volume expansion at fully lithiated states are 434 (399)% (Si), 382 (353)% (Ge), and 305 (259)% (Sn) for amorphous (crystalline) Li\u00c0M alloys.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nINTRODUCTIONThe growing demands for safer lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with higher capacity and longer durability have led to the search for nextgeneration electrode materials. Although the most widely used graphite anodes in LIBs have good cycling performance with a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g \u00c01 (LiC 6 ), other group IV semiconductors (Si, Ge, Sn) can offer significantly higher capacities: 4200 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4.4 Si, 1600 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4. 4 Ge, and 990 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4.4 Sn.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe then discuss the energetics, structural evolution, and variations in electronic and mechanical properties of crystalline and amorphous Li\u00c0M alloys.

For instance, the diffusivity of Li in Ge is about 400 times greater than that of Li in Si at room temperature, 17 which may contribute to faster charge/discharge rates. Thus far, there has been no comprehensive comparison study on Si, Ge, and Sn as to the dynamic behavior of Li incorporation, the stability of the host lattices, and the properties of the alloys formed during lithiation.

Structural color hydrogels are one of the most important examples and have been widely studied and used in switches, optical devices, sensing materials, and wearable electronics, etc. [citation 17]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Magnetic assembly and field-tuning of ellipsoidal-nanoparticle-based colloidal photonic crystals \nAbstract: Anisotropic nanostructures provide an additional degree of freedom for tailoring the collective properties of their ensembles. Using Fe@SiO2 nanoellipsoids as anisotropic building blocks, herein we demonstrate a new class of magnetically responsive photonic structures whose photonic properties can be dynamically tuned by controlling the direction of the magnetic fields they are exposed to. These novel photonic structures diffract at a minimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle, and a maximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel direction; and the diffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is moved off-angle. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[1] Easily found in nature, such as opals,b ird feathers,a nd butterfly scales,s tructural color is brilliantly iridescent, metallic,a nd free from photobleaching unlike conventional pigments or dyes.Most colloidal assembly processes mimic the formation of opals and create close-packed structures from monodisperse colloidal spheres.H owever,l iving systems often involve non-closepacked ordered assemblies of anisotropic motifs,s uch as plates and rods,t hus display significantly more complex structural color responses including strong angular dependence and polarization effect. [2] Prior efforts have been made to organizing elongated particles,s uch as polystyrene and ZnS, [3] albeit the assembly methods are rather conventional and the resulting crystals do not exhibit different photonic responses to those from spherical particles.One of the important advantages of anisotropic particles is that they often have shape-dependent physical and chemical properties,which can add more degrees of freedom for manipulating the collective properties of the resultant superstructures.This is of particular interest to the fabrication of field-responsive colloidal photonic structures,i nw hich static or dynamic structural changes are usually accompanied by switching of photonic properties.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nU sing Fe@SiO 2 nanoellipsoids as anisotropic building blocks,h erein we demonstrate an ew class of magnetically responsive photonic structures whose photonic properties can be dynamically tuned by controlling the direction of the magnetic fields they are exposed to.T hese novel photonic structures diffract at am inimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle, and am aximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel direction;a nd the diffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is moved off-angle.Colloidal assembly has been widely explored to produce artificial structural color by manipulating the light interaction with physical periodic structures.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[4a] As expected, nanoellipsoids with higher aspect ratio,a si nt he case of NE-B than that of NE-A, lead to more changes in the interplanar spacing when the orientation of the assembled crystals are switched, resulting in abroader tuning range in photonic response.Theo rientational dependence of the nanoellipsoidal assemblies can find direct use in creating photonic patterns under magnetic fields with non-uniform field directions.A s demonstrated in Figure 3f,w hen subjected to complex magnetic field produced by an on-ideal linear Halbach array which has aspatially rotating pattern of magnetization, adispersion of NE-B encapsulated in aflat glass tube exhibits ar ainbow pattern containing blue,g reen, and red stripes. Unlike our previously demonstrated one-dimensional photonic assembly which only shows single color stripes at areas with field parallel to the incident angle, [5a] the current system displays red and blue stripes at areas with parallel and horizontal fields,and atransitional green stripe in between at off-angle areas.In addition to orientation, the interplanar spacing of the photonic assemblies is also determined by the volume fractions of the nanoellipsoids.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These data indicate that chloride levels started rising in the mid-19th century and began accelerating in the early twentieth century. Lake Superior's and Lake Michigan's concentrations have continued to increase steadily and currently stand at their maximum recorded levels. In contrast, lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario reached peak levels between 1965 and 1975, but then began to decline. However, recent data indicate that the chloride concentrations in these lakes are now increasing again. Because loading data are not readily available, a mass-balance model is employed to estimate the chloride inputs required to account for the concentration trends. This inverse analysis yields computed load reductions that are consistent with reported industrial load reductions during the last three decades of the 20th century. Hence, it appears that the improvements were for the most part attributable to industrial controls. The model is also used to predict that if loads are held fixed at 2006 levels, concentrations in all lakes will continue to increase with the most dramatic rise occurring in Lake Michigan which will ultimately approach the level of Lake Erie. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBeyond its utility as an indicator, chloride can also have direct adverse impacts on lakes and other freshwater ecosystems. The Canadian federal government has recommended that road salt be added to the List of Toxic Substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act because of tangible threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2001). It has also been suggested that increases of chloride and other ions could be directly harmful to the Great Lakes ecosystem by fostering the spread of less-desirable halophilic organisms (Stoermer, 1978). More generally, trends of all major anions and cations are relevant as they contribute to aspects of lake chemistry such as ionic strength, pH and acid neutralizing capacity. Finally, at sufficiently high concentrations, chloride can influence density stratification as well as degrade the taste of drinking water.Two classic papers first established that Great Lakes chloride levels had increased significantly over the past century. In a perceptive and timely data analysis, Beeton (1965) documented substantial increases, starting as early as the late 19th century, in all the lakes with the exception of Lake Superior.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nChloride itself is not directly toxic, at least not at concentrations currently observed in the offshore regions of the Great Lakes. Other, indirect effects of chloride, such as changing the lake's chemical suitability for aquatic species, or impacting the mixing ability of the water column, may be influencing Great Lakes water quality.The modeling work presented here is significant in demonstrating the backdrop against which other, non-conservative substances, may be changing in the lakes. For example, the recent chloride increases in the upper lakes that are shown here are at least partially attributable to increased loadings that occurred in the past. The recent increases in the lower lakes are shown to be in part attributable to increased road salt usage in the watersheds and possibly also new or resuming industrial inputs.Beyond their water-quality implications, the chloride trends serve as \"canaries in the coal mine\" and show that, despite many improve-ments in Great Lakes water quality, human influences continue to impact offshore water quality. Furthermore, recent impacts may be as serious as past influences, and the sources may now be more diffuse and difficult to control. Consequently, vigilant stewardship based on continuous monitoring and scientific study must be vigorously supported in order to adequately protect this treasured system.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAlthough local increases may have occurred in the Great Lakes basin over this period, there is currently no direct evidence to confirm this hypothesis.The chloride concentration of untreated municipal wastewater ranges from about 20 to 160 mg/L (O' Connor and Mueller, 1970;Sonzogni et al., 1983;Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). In the 1970s, many wastewater treatment plants in the Great Lakes basin added ferric chloride to enhance phosphorus removal. As reported by Sonzogni et al. (1983), increases in chloride effluent concentration from these additions are on the order of 10 mg/L. Hence, the addition would not significantly increase normal effluent concentrations. Because sewage effluent is a relatively small component of the total chloride load, it is doubtful that the additional ferric chloride inputs could account for the recent increases.\nNew industrial sourcesThe second way in which loading might still be increasing would be if new industrial chloride discharges had begun entering the system since 1980. Because chloride loading is currently not being monitored, there is no available evidence pointing to significant new dischargers. The U.S.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFigure 2D shows that, on average, dynamic changes in tyrosine phosphorylation occur much faster and from a lower basal level compared to serine/ threonine phosphorylation.We found phosphorylation sites on a wide variety of proteins, and about half the proteins contained more than one site (Table S2). Figure 2E shows a Gene Ontology (GO) (Zeeberg et al., 2003) analysis of the in vivo phosphoproteome. GO localization information existed for 1,589 of the 2,244 phosphoproteins. Almost half of the phosphorylation events occurred on nuclear proteins, whereas only one-third of all proteins in the database were assigned as nuclear by GO, indicating that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins. The proportion of regulated proteins closely paralleled the total number of phosphorylations of nuclear proteins. As expected, proteins annotated as extracellular were significantly underrepresented in the phosphoproteome. Although there is evidence of a mitochondrial phosphoproteome (Pagliarini and Dixon, 2006), proteins annotated as mitochondrial by GO were underrepresented, as were plasma membrane proteins.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs in the case of SwissProt, close to 90% of our data are novel compared with these previous studies. Taken together, our data suggest that, despite several decades of research into phosphorylation, most in vivo phosphorylation sites have still not been detected.\nPhosphoproteome DynamicsEGF signaling begins with activation of the EGF receptor and extends through a cascade of downstream kinases to mediate the increased phosphorylation of a large number of substrate proteins. The overall levels of phosphorylated proteins within a specific cellular compartment are also affected by other processes, including dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, protein degradation via ubiquitination, and translocation of the protein to another subcellular location. Our experiment measures the net effect of all these diverse processes that collectively regulate the dynamic phosphoproteome.To search for patterns in the time profiles of the regulated phosphopeptides, we explored several clustering techniques. Clustering algorithms have been applied extensively to the analysis of gene-expression data, including time-series data sets.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nGiven that we have observed 2,244 phosphoproteins in a single cell line and taking into account the sensitivity and dynamic range limitations of current MS technology (de Godoy et al., 2006), it is clear that a large proportion of cellular proteins are phosphorylated.We compared our data set with all annotated human phospho-sites in the SwissProt database from experimental data or inferred from homologous sequences (3,262 sites in version 48.0) and also included four previous phosphoproteomics data sets in our analysis (Amanchy et al., 2005;Beausoleil et al., 2004;Stover et al., 2004;Thelemann et al., 2005). We found that more than 90% of our sites were novel with respect to SwissProt. From the four previous data sets, we were able to map 1,890 sites onto IPI version 3.13. Of these, 691 (37%) were also found in our data set (Table S5). Given that the previous studies generally used lower-resolution MS and different experimental conditions, this is a relatively high value.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

There was little difference between beginners and experts.\nAlthough all the specimens were chosen to meet our published criteria for osteoarthritis, the experts were unanimous is agreeing the diagnosis in only three cases and the beginners in only one.\nThese results suggest that more work needs to be done to develop operational definitions for the classification of disease in palaeopathology and that great care must be taken when comparing disease frequencies between studies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe inferior facet joint (shown in Figure 1) had very obvious eburnation and scoring on the joint surface and could not possibly have been mistaken for anything other than osteoarthritis; the fact that so many people did misdiagnose it suggests that they were actually scoring the normal, superior facet joint; this, at least, is our most charitable explanation.In general, there was better agreement about the diagnosis when eburnation was present, although three of the experts and two of the beginners did not diagnose specimen 10 as having osteoarthritis even though there was an obvious area of eburnation on the inferior surface of the head of this metatarsal.O n e practical outcome of this study must be that greater efforts will need to be taken to agree on the criteria >for the classification of pathological changes in palaeopathology. What is required for palaeopathological work is the development of operational definitions, since it is not valid entirely t o rely on either clinical or radiological diagnoses. For example, we have shown that radiology is not reliable in detecting changes that are evident to the palaeopathologist.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFigure 1 .1Figure 1.

[citation 19], also provide anytime guarantees for the multivehicle-routing problem.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem \nAbstract: In the dial-a-ride problem, users formulate requests for transportation from a specific origin to a specific destination. Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1} \u2200i \u2208 N, j \u2208 N, k \u2208 K. (14)The objective function (1) minimizes the total routing cost. Constraints (2) and (3) ensure that each request is served exactly once and that the origin and destination nodes are visited by the same vehicle. Constraints (4)-( 6) guarantee that the route of each vehicle k starts at the origin depot and ends at the destination depot. Consistence of the time and load variables is ensured by constraints ( 7) and (8). Equalities (9) define the ride time of each user which is bounded by constraints (12). It is worth mentioning that the latter also act as precedence constraints because the non-negativity of the L k i variables ensures that node i will be visited before node n + i for every user i. Finally, inequalities (10) bound the duration of each route while ( 11) and ( 13) impose time windows and capacity constraints, respectively. This formulation is non-linear because of constraints ( 7) and ( 8).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAlthough no polyhedral analysis was carried out, the usefulness of these inequalities has been demonstrated through computational experiments. A comparison with version 8.1 of CPLEX shows that the branch-and-cut algorithm proposed here reduces both the CPU time and the number of nodes explored in the branch-and-bound tree. The methodology proposed in this paper obviously cannot be used to solve large-scale instances containing hundreds or thousands of users as it is sometimes the case in large cities. It is, however, fast enough to be used as a post-processor to optimize individual routes or small subsets of routes produced by a meta-heuristic. In the presence of ride time constraints, using dynamic programming would be difficult since the states of the dynamic programming algorithm would have to take into account the individual ride time of each user. Future work will concentrate on the development of more refined separation procedures for the various types of inequalities introduced in this paper.for U 1 must visit node n + i 2 before visiting node i 1 .

Based on a combination of molecular characteristics typical of many Precambrian bitumens, their consistently and unusually high thermal maturities, and their widespread distribution throughout the Hamersley Basin, the bitumens can be characterized as \u2018probably of Archean age\u2019. Accepting this interpretation, the biomarkers open a new window on Archean biodiversity. The presence of hopanes in the Archean rocks confirms the antiquity of the domain Bacteria, and high relative concentrations of 2\u03b1-methylhopanes indicate that cyanobacteria were important primary producers. Oxygenic photosynthesis therefore evolved > 2.7 Ga ago, and well before independent evidence suggests significant levels of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. Moreover, the abundance of cyanobacterial biomarkers in shales interbedded with oxide-facies banded iron formations (BIF) indicates that although some Archean BIF might have been formed by abiotic photochemical processes or anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, those in the Hamersley Group formed as a direct consequence of biological oxygen production. Biomarkers of the 3\u03b2-methylhopane series suggest that microaerophilic heterotrophic bacteria, probably methanotrophs or methylotrophs, were active in late Archean environments. The presence of steranes in a wide range of structures with relative abundances like those from late Paleoproterozoic to Phanerozoic sediments is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean, 900 Ma before visible fossil evidence indicates that the lineage arose. Sterol biosynthesis in extant eukaryotes requires molecular oxygen. The presence of steranes together with biomarkers of oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria suggests that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in some regions of the upper water column was equivalent to at least \u223c1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) and may have been sufficient to support aerobic respiration. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDinosteranes are abundant biomarkers in almost all Mesozoic and Cenozoic bitumens (Moldowan et al., 1996) but have also been detected in the Paleozoic and Proterozoic, albeit in lower concentrations (Moldowan et al., 1996). So far, the oldest known dinosteranes come from the \u03f31.1-Ga Nonesuch Shale, Michigan (Summons and Walter, 1990). The biologic precursor of dinosteranes is dinosterol that is commonly regarded as diagnostic for dinoflagellates (Robinson et al., 1984;Summons et al., 1987Summons et al., , 1992;;Moldowan et al., 1996;Moldowan and Talyzina, 1998), although it has also been recorded in one diatom species as a minor component (Volkman et al., 1993).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs fossil dinoflagellates (and diatoms) first appear in the Mesozoic, dinosteranes discovered in Paleozoic and Proterozoic sedimentary rocks were described as products of ancestral dinoflagellates (protodinoflagellates) (Moldowan et al., 1996). However, dinosteranes of Archean age have more likely a biologically independent origin, as ancestral dinoflagellates and diatoms almost certainly appeared much later in Earth history.So, the wide structural range of steranes in the Archean bitumens in relative proportion similar to those of many younger bitumens is evidence for the presence of eukaryotes in the late Archean. But the phylogenetic status of the sterol producers within the domain Eucarya in the late Archean remains to be resolved.\nLow Levels of Change Through 3 Ga of Lipid BiosynthesisA striking feature of the 2.7-Ga-old Archean bitumens is their similarity to other Precambrian, but also Phanerozoic samples.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHigher concentrations of sterols with the 4-methylcholestane (C 28 ), 4-methyl-24-methylcholestane (C 29 ) and 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestane (C 30 ) skeletons are present in most dinoflagellates (Robinson et al., 1984) and less commonly in diatoms (Nichols et al., 1990). Sterols with the 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestane skeleton (C 30 ) have also been isolated from prymnesiophyte algae of the order Pavlovales (Volkman et al., 1990), and with the 4-methylcholestane skeleton (C 28 ) from the methylotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus (Bird et al., 1971). Regular 4-methylsteranes are therefore not sufficiently taxon-specific to interpret their occurrence in Archean bitumen below domain level.4\u2423,23,24-Trimethylcholestanes (dinosteranes) also occur in trace amounts in the Archean bitumens (Brocks et al., 2003).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here it is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that proper intensification of ionized impurity scattering to charge carriers can benefit the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) by increasing the Seebeck coefficient and decreasing the electronic thermal conductivity. The optimal strength of ionized impurity scattering for maximum ZT depends on the Fermi level and the density of states effective mass. Cr\u2010doping in CeyCo4Sb12 progressively increases the strength of ionized impurity scattering, and significantly improves the Seebeck coefficient, resulting in high power factors of 45 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 with relatively low electrical conductivity. This effect, combined with the increased Ce\u2010filling fraction and thus decreased lattice thermal conductivity by charge compensation of Cr\u2010dopant, gives rise to a maximum ZT of 1.3 at 800 K and a large average ZT of 1.1 between 500 and 850 K, \u224830% and \u224820% enhancements as compared with those of Cr\u2010free sample, respectively. Furthermore, this study also reveals that carrier scattering parameter can be another fundamental degree of freedom to optimize electrical properties and improve thermal\u2010to\u2010electricity conversion efficiencies of thermoelectric materials. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 21 ] The carrier scattering probability by ionized impurity is inversely proportional to \u03b5 3/2 ( \u03b5 : carrier energy) or v 3 ( v : drift velocity), [ 22,23 ] therefore the low energy carriers would experience more scattering and be fi ltered out by the charged impurities. This energy fi ltering effect could enhance the Seebeck coeffi cient, analogous to the effect of energy barriers. [ 3,15 ] Theoretically this offers the possibility to optimize PF through balancing the mobility decrease and the Seebeck coeffi cient enhancement, and the optimal scattering parameter should depend on the Fermi level and other material-specifi c para meters. [ 14,18,24 ] This effect is analogue to the prediction by Ioffe [ 25 ] about a half century ago, however, rather precise control of the impurity scattering strength is required to realize power factor and ZT improvements in heavily doped semiconductors.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[ 10 ] Strategies such as carrier concentration engineering [ 2,11 ] and band structure modifi cation [ 12 ] have been identifi ed to be effective for PF and ZT enhancements.Besides being pertinent to the electronic band structure and the Fermi level, electrical transport properties are also closely related to the carrier scattering processes, including phonon scattering, impurity scattering, energy barrier scattering, etc. [13][14][15] Above room temperature, lattice vibrations generally dominate the carrier scattering for most of the thermoelectric materials, e.g., Bi 2 Te 3 [ 16 ] or PbTe. [ 17 ] Since almost all of the thermoelectric materials are heavily doped semiconductors, impurity scattering, especially ionized impurity scattering, could play an important role in carrier transport at T > 300 K, as evident in Ni-doped [ 18,19 ] or Te-doped [ 20 ] CoSb 3 , or transition metalsubstituted clathrates.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[ 26 ] Indeed, Ioffe's initial experimental work about PbTe gave no enhancement in power factor or ZT , [ 25 ] and subsequently numerical calculations done by Ure [ 24 ] predicted no more than 10% enhancement in ZT by introducing ionized impurities. These may have contributed to the dormancy of studying the infl uence of ionized impurity scattering on thermoelectrics, and to the best of our knowledge only limited experimental results have been reported.

It is an integral (Fock) operator for hybrids but a differential operator [citation 31] for meta-GGAs, the same operator for occupied and unoccupied one-electron states.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: More realistic band gaps from meta-generalized gradient approximations: Only in a generalized Kohn-Sham scheme \nAbstract: Unlike the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), calculations with meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGA) are usually done according to the generalized Kohn-Sham (gKS) formalism. The exchange-correlation potential of the gKS equation is nonmultiplicative, which prevents systematic comparison of meta-GGA band structures to those of the LDA and the GGA. We implement the optimized effective potential (OEP) of the meta-GGA for periodic systems, which allows us to carry out meta-GGA calculations in the same KS manner as for the LDA and the GGA. We apply the OEP to several meta-GGAs, including the new SCAN functional [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)]. We find that the KS gaps and KS band structures of meta-GGAs are close to those of GGAs. They are smaller than the more realistic gKS gaps of meta-GGAs, but probably close to the less-realistic gaps in the band structure of the exact KS potential, as can be seen by comparing with the gaps of the EXX+ RPA OEP potential. The well-known grid sensitivity of meta-GGAs is much more severe in OEP calculations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(4)Eq.

But the fact that a property can be fitted in DFT is not evidence that it should be, or that other and more appropriate properties will not deteriorate as a result.\nII.

It is unclear whether the KS gap itself is improved, or just the gKS gap is improved. One needs to do meta-GGA calculations in the KS scheme to be able to have a systematic comparsion of the KS band gaps between meta-GGA and GGA.In the gKS formalism for an orbital functional such as a meta-GGA or hybrid functional, we find the \"optimal variational potential\", a non-multiplicative self-adjoint operator that minimizes the energy functional with respect to the orbitals. This potential is a differential operator for a meta-GGA and an integral operator for a hybrid functional. In the KS formalism for an orbital functional, we find the optimized effective potential (OEP) 15,16 , the multiplicative xc potential that minimizes the energy.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The aim of our study was to assess the functional state of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling in patients with MS. Tr1 cells were induced in vitro by activation with anti-CD46 antibodies in controls and patients with MS. Cells were phenotyped by cytometry and suppression assays, and the expression of cytokines and transcription factors was evaluated by real-time PCR, ELISA, cytometry and Western blotting. We found that the activity of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling is impaired in MS patients since Tr1 cells isolated from MS patients produced less IL-10 than those obtained from controls. Indeed, the supernatants from Tr1 cells from controls did not suppress the proliferation of stimulated CD4(+) cells from patients with MS. Furthermore, the IL-10R signaling pathway was not fully active in CD4(+) cells from MS patients and these cells had higher baseline levels of SOCS3 transcripts than controls. Indeed, after in vitro IL-10 stimulation, the expression levels of the STAT1, STAT3 and IL-10RA genes were higher in MS patients than in controls. Moreover, Stat-3 phosphorylation was lower in controls than in patients after IL-10 stimulation. These results indicate that IL-10 regulatory function is impaired in patients with MS. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[21] demonstrated that Tr1 function is also impaired in patients with MS. Moreover, the expression of the immunosuppressor cytokine IL-10 is diminished in MS patients [22,23], in accordance with previous studies describing fewer IL-10-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Interestingly, there is a reduction in the expression of IL-10 but elevated numbers of PBMC expressing IL-10 transcripts before clinical relapse in MS [24], and there is a correlation between IL-10 levels and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients [25]. Engineered Th2/Tr1 cells that produce high levels of IL-10 prevent epitope spreading and ameliorate the disease course in animal models of MS [26]. However, it is unknown whether the functional activity of IL-10 in MS is preserved, and attempts to treat MS patients with IL-10 have not been successful to date.In order to explore the functionality of Tr1 regulatory function in MS, we assessed the ex vivo induction of the Tr1 phenotype and the response of CD4 + cells to the IL-10 produced by these cells in patients with MS.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1D) and they also augmented the levels of both intracellular (Fig. 1D) and secreted IL-10 protein (Fig. 1E; p <0.05 in all cases). Finally, we assessed whether Tr1 cells acted as regulatory Tcells, by assessing the capacity of the secreted cytokines (mainly IL-10) to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. We found that the supernatants from Tr1 cell cultures, containing high levels of IL-10 (in the range of 5580-7533 pg/mL), as well as recombinant IL-10, were able to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + Tcells (Fig. 1F; p <0.001). This suppression was impaired in the presence of the anti-IL-10 antibody, confirming that the suppression was mediated by IL-10 (Fig. 1F).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIndeed, stimulation of CD4 + cells increased the expression of IL-10 and IFN-c RNA (p <0.05 in both cases) but not that of IL-2 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we assessed whether such CD4 + Tcell cultures remain stable over time and whether Tr1 cells released large amounts of IL-10 upon further stimulation. The same CD46-induced Tr1 induction protocol was applied to cells from five healthy control (HC) individuals and a second stimulation was applied 10 days later with an anti-CD3 rather than the anti-CD46 antibody. When the Tr1 phenotype was assessed at different intervals, we found that after the first stimulation the majority of the cells had developed an activation and memory phenotype. Moreover, they increased the release of IL-10, the production of which peaked at day 3 and decreased over the following 10 days. Over the next 7 days, the Tr1 cells maintained the activation and memory phenotype, but they produced less IL-10. After a second stimulation 10 days later, the majority of the cells showed a CD25 + CD45RO + activation/memory phenotype (65%; Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-I) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered IFN-\u03b2 are partly mediated by AhR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AhR agonists that act on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AhR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDepending on the experimental model, pro-and anti-inflammatory effects of the commensal flora have been recently reported 57,58,14,15,59 highlighting the need to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the commensal flora regulates the immune response. In this context, our work contributes to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of AhR agonists generated from dietary Trp by TnAse dependent and independent pathways in commensal bacteria 44 . Moreover, our results identify a molecular pathway through which the diet in cooperation with the commensal flora modulate the activity of CNS resident cells and neuroinflammation. In addition, the regulation of AhR expression by IFN-\u03b2 suggest that the microbiome may affect not only the development of CNS autoimmunity, but also its response to disease modifying therapies 60 . Thus, the study of the metabolic and environmental factors that regulate astrocyte activity may shed light on CNS physiology, identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and drive the development of more efficacious therapeutic interventions for MS and other neurologic diseases.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nEAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AhR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.Astrocytes are the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system (CNS). They participate in diverse functions including control of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the regulation of metabolism, the modulation of neuronal transmission and CNS development and repair [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAstrocytes also play important roles during CNS injury and disease, and are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [10][11][12] . Astrocyte activity is affected by factors produced within and outside the CNS, therefore, the study of these factors may shed light on the regulation of astrocyte function in health and disease and identify new therapeutic approaches for human neurologic disorders.The microbial flora and its products have been shown to control T cell-dependent inflammation through several mechanisms including the conversion of precursors provided by the diet into immune regulatory metabolites [13][14][15] . However, less is known about the effects of the diet and microbial products on the inflammatory response of resident cells in the CNS. Here we identify an IFN-I and AhR axis that integrates immunologic, metabolic and environmental cues to regulate astrocyte activity and CNS inflammation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Experimental immunization with sporozoites induces this type of protective response, but the extremely large number of proteins expressed by Plasmodium parasites has so far prohibited the identification of sufficient discrete T-cell antigens to develop subunit vaccines that produce sterile immunity. Here, using mice singly immunized with Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites and high-throughput screening, we identified a unique CTL response against the parasite ribosomal L3 protein. Unlike CTL responses to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the population of L3-specific CTLs was not expanded by multiple sporozoite immunizations. CSP is abundant in the sporozoite itself, whereas L3 expression does not increase until the liver stage. The response induced by a single immunization with sporozoites reduces the parasite load in the liver so greatly during subsequent immunizations that L3-specific responses are only generated during the primary exposure. Functional L3-specific CTLs can, however, be expanded by heterologous prime-boost regimens. Thus, although repeat sporozoite immunization expands responses to preformed antigens like CSP that are present in the sporozoite itself, this immunization strategy may not expand CTLs targeting parasite proteins that are synthesized later. Heterologous strategies may be needed to increase CTL responses across the entire spectrum of Plasmodium liver-stage proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe lack of L3 boosting by repeated sporozoite exposures may be emblematic of a phenomenon affecting other liver-stage parasite antigens as well. Heterologous prime-boost approaches are being used for malaria vaccination-challenge studies in mice and humans (49). Our findings make the case for heterologous approaches at the antigen discovery phase as well. By inducing a broad immune repertoire, we may be able to generate responses capable of eradicating all malariainfected hepatocytes, including those missed by CSP-or other sporozoite-limited responses.\nMaterials and MethodsReagents.

Balb/cj and Thy1.1 + BALB/c mice from Jackson Laboratories (6-8 wk old) were housed in approved facilities at the University of Washington for studies approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were infected i.v.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nL3-specific killing in mice primed with L3 peptide-pulsed DCs was boosted by a secondary sporozoite immunization (Fig. 4E). In all of these studies, CSP-specific responses could be potently triggered by any combination of DC and/or sporozoite immunizations.To test whether heterologous prime-boost immunization could overcome the poor L3 response in sporozoite immunized mice, we primed mice with L3 peptide-pulsed DCs or GAP sporozoites and boosted with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) expressing the L3 epitope (Lm-L3). Similar to the behavior of CSP-specific cells following multiple sporozoite immunizations, these heterologous prime-boost approaches expanded the population of activated (CD11a HI CD62L LO CD44 HI ) L3-specific T cells by 0.74 or 1.67 log 10 cells per spleen for L3 peptide-pulsed DC or GAP priming, respectively, compared with the appropriately matched Lm-L3 priming immunization alone (Fig. 4 F and G).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n5B). These studies confirm the absence of developing parasites in multiplyimmunized mice. The lack of L3 expression in later immunizations explains why L3 CTLs are primed by sporozoite immunization but not boosted by homologous sporozoite immunization and further supports heterologous strategies for inducing T-cell responses against malaria parasite antigens.\nDiscussionWhole sporozoite immunization can protect animal and human subjects, with major contributions from antibody and T-cellmediated responses to CSP (46). However, as described earlier, CSP-specific immunity is not absolutely necessary or sufficient to attain immunological protection against challenge (11,(21)(22)(23)(24). Thus, there is a need to identify individual immunogenic antigens so that they can be evaluated for inclusion in multicomponent subunit vaccines. Using a unique HTS system for CD8 + T-cell antigen identification (32), we, like others (28), detected many low frequency T-cell responses to sporozoite vaccinations, with a trend toward more diversity in less-attenuated parasites (e.g., CPS and GAP > RAS), as has been reported (27).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy study of gate-tunable tBLG devices supported by atomically smooth and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (BN). The high quality of these tBLG devices allows identification of coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns and moir\u00e9 super-superlattices produced by graphene-graphene and graphene-BN interlayer interactions. Furthermore, we examine additional tBLG spectroscopic features in the local density of states beyond the first van Hove singularity. Our experimental data are explained by a theory of moir\u00e9 bands that incorporates ab initio calculations and confirms the strongly nonperturbative character of tBLG interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBy comparing the moir\u00e9 wavelength dependence of this new feature's energy to calculations incorporating ab initio results, we find that it arises from a partial gap opening between the second and third moir\u00e9 bands due to strong non-perturbative interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. These measurements on our high quality tBLG/BN samples provide a first look into the atomic-scale behavior of electrostatically gated tBLG, an important device configuration for future applications [28,29].Our measurements were performed using an Omicron ultra-high vacuum (UHV) STM operating at temperature T = 5 K with electrochemically etched PtIr tips. The tips were calibrated against the surface state of an Au(111) crystal before performing all measurements [30]. Differential conductance (dI/dV) was measured by lock-in detection of the a.c. tunnel current modulated by a 6-8 meV (rms), 400-700 Hz signal added to the sample bias (V s ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nElectronic structure measurements of tBLG on less interacting substrates, such as hexagonal boron nitride (BN) [24][25][26][27], are therefore necessary to understand the intrinsic properties of tBLG.Here we report a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of electrostatically gated tBLG supported by a BN substrate (tBLG/BN). The high quality of our tBLG/BN devices enables us to visualize new tBLG phenomena on multiple length scales, from atomic lattices to moir\u00e9 supersuperlattices. Although coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns have previously been observed in graphitic multilayers [9,10], we demonstrate here that moir\u00e9 patterns produced by graphene-graphene interlayer interactions can coincide with moir\u00e9 patterns that arise from graphene-BN interactions to produce a new supersuperlattice structure. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of tBLG/BN yield new insight into how the intrinsic electronic behavior of tBLG is affected by moir\u00e9-induced interactions. For example, we observe an additional dip feature in the DOS at an energy beyond the first VHS.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese resultsshow that the strong coupling, low twist-angle regime in tBLG can be accessed using scanned probe techniques via high quality devices that allow electrostatic Fermi level tuning.

The presence of these moir\u00e9 patterns indicates that the interfaces between the graphene and BN layers are atomically sharp and free from contamination. The origins of the different moir\u00e9 patterns are easily distinguished since the depressions in the graphene-graphene moir\u00e9 pattern form a honeycomb-like appearance, whereas the depressions in the graphene-BN moir\u00e9 pattern resemble a triangular lattice.

Consequently, volume contributions to the free energy (e.g., intermolecular potential and entropy), which are the basis of the known phase diagram (26)(27)(28), are progressively balanced by interfacial contributions (29). Under confinement, cyclohexane is known to exhibit a depression of phase-transition temperatures (2,(30)(31)(32) and a reduction of normalized enthalpies (32), as well as lower critical points (31,33,34).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nRecent molecular dynamics simulations (30) of this interface are consistent with our observations. The combined areas under the peaks corresponding to these oriented and weakly bonded water molecules [that is, those that straddle the interface (nos. 4 and 2) and in-terfacial water monomers/HB acceptors (no.3)] make the most substantial contribution to the VSF spectrum and consequently represent the majority of the water molecules in the interfacial region. Although quantitative comparison of peak areas is complicated by the fact that increased hydrogen bonding results in stronger OH stretch intensity (17), such trends would support an even stronger dominance in the proportion of weakly interacting interfacial water molecules at these organic/water interfaces. The spectra do not provide support for commonly accepted models of an increase in the coordination number of water molecules at an organic/water interface and/or a strengthening of the hydrogenbonding network between water molecules, both which would appear as a growth in intensity at lower frequencies rather than as an observed reduction in intensity in this region.These studies demonstrate that dipolar interactions between interfacial water molecules and the polarizable organic phase play an important role in the interfacial region, resulting in strong orientation effects.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3%) of 1,505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBackgroundZIKAV, an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus [5], was first isolated in 1947 from a monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda [6]. Sporadic human Zika fever cases have been reported since the 1960s [7]. The first documented outbreak outside Africa and Asia occurred in 2007 in the Yap State, Micronesia, in the North Pacific, where Zika fever was characterised by rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia [8].ZIKAV has been isolated from several Aedes mosquito species, notably including Ae. aegypti [9] and Ae. albopictus [10]. Ae. aegypti is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and Ae. albopictus is now established in many parts of Europe, especially Mediterranean countries [11]. Recent reports of imported cases of ZIKAV infection from south-east Asia or the Pacific to Europe [12] or Japan [13] highlight the risk of ZIKAV emergence in parts of the world where the vector is present.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections. Arbovirus transfusionderived transmission has been reported principally for WNV [19], DENV [20] and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [21,22]. For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high [21,22].During the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007) [21] and in R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-07) [22], blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia.Due to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR [16]. The protocol was implemented in November 2013, when agreement from the French Polynesian health authorities was obtained.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nGenetic and serologic properties of Zika virus associated with an epidemic, Yap State, Micronesia\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRSLanciotti\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOLKosoy\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJJLaven\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJOVelez\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJLambert\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAJJohnson\n\t\t\n\t\t10.3201/eid1408.080287\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEmerg Infect Dis\n\t\t\n\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2007. 2008\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDengue: a potential transfusiontransmitted disease\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKMTomashek\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHSMargolis\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03269.x\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTransfusion\n\t\t\n\t\t\t51\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWest Nile virus\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSLRossi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTMRoss\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJDEvans\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.cll.2009.10.006\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tClin Lab Med\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2010\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

How caspase-11 executes these downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 maturation. A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, Gsdmd(-/-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Gram-negative bacteria. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOur data reveal that proteolytic cleavage of Gsdmd by mouse caspase-11 or human caspase-4 is essential for pyroptosis of innate immune cells and endothelial cells harbouring LPS-tainted cytoplasm. Cleaved Gsdmd also triggers NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 through a cell-intrinsic pathway (Fig. 4c), although the exact mechanism responsible for NLRP3 activation remains unclear. NLRP3 senses diverse stimuli that perturb intracellular homeostasis 6, 19,21,22 , so its activation may be an indirect consequence of the effects of the Gsdmd p30 fragment. Future studies will need to address exactly what the p30 fragment does in cells. The redefined non-canonical inflammasome signalling pathway (Fig. 4c) refutes the previous hypothesis that a caspase-1/11 complex is responsible for caspase-1 activation 1, 36 .The partial contribution of Gsdmd to caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis suggests the existence of other pro-pyroptotic caspase-1 substrates (Fig. 5d).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nLoss of NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1 in BMDMs did not markedly affect caspase-11-dependent generation of mature Gsdmd p30 in response to cytoplasmic LPS (Fig. 4a), indicating that Gsdmd cleavage occurs upstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The question arises as to whether Gsdmd induces pyroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation simultaneously in the same cell, or if Gsdmd-mediated pyroptosis releases damage-associated molecular patterns 29 that trigger caspase-11-independent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neighbouring cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We believe the latter hypothesis is unlikely because LPS-stimulated Il1b 2/2 BMDMs exhibited normal pyroptosis, yet their culture supernatant failed to induce IL-1b secretion from Casp11 2/2 BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3c). Collectively, these data indicate that caspase-11 directly cleaves the 53-kDa inactive precursor form of Gsdmd (pro-Gsdmd) to generate the propyroptotic N-terminal fragment (Gsdmd p30, Fig. 1b). In full-length Gsdmd, the C terminus may mask key sites in the N terminus until cleavage at D 276 #G 277 releases this inhibition. Consistent with this notion, reconstitution of immortalized Gsdmd 2/2 macrophages with wild-type Gsdmd restored LPS responsiveness, as evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, IL-1b secretion and caspase-1 processing, whereas reconstitution with the Gsdmd processing mutant D276A did not (Fig. 3d,e). In addition, mutation of Gsdmd within the p30 fragment (I105N) attenuated pyroptosis and caspase-1/IL-1b processing (Fig. 1b, e and Extended Data Fig. 2b) without affecting Gsdmd cleavage (Extended Data Fig. 4b).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We investigated the actions of Nec-1 and its so-called inactive analog, Nec-1i, in the setting of myocardial I/R injury.\nMaterials and methods: The actions of Nec-1 and Nec-1i were examined in cultured C2C12 and H9c2 myocytes, cardiomyocytes isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats, Langendorff isolated perfused C57Bl/6J mouse hearts and an in vivo open-chest C57Bl/6J mouse heart model.\nResults: Nec-1 at 30 microM and 100 microM (but not 100 microM Nec-1i) reduced peroxide-induced cell death in C2C12 cells from 51.2 +/- 1.1% (control) to 26.3 +/- 2.9% (p < 0.01 vs control) and 17.8 +/- 0.9% (p < 0.001), respectively. With H9c2 cells cell death was also reduced from 73.0 +/- 0.4% (control) to 56.7 +/- 0% (30 microM Nec-1, p < 0.05) and 45.4 +/- 3.3% (100 microM Nec-1, p < 0.01). In the isolated perfused heart Nec-1 (30 microM) reduced infarct size (calculated as a percentage of the risk area) from 48.0 +/- 2.0% (control) to 32.1 +/- 5.4% (p < 0.05). Nec-1i (30 microM) also reduced infarct size (32.9 +/- 5.1%, p < 0.05). In anesthetized C57Bl/6J mice Nec-1 (1.65 mg/kg), given intraperitoneally to coincide with reperfusion following left anterior descending artery ligation (30 min), also reduced infarct size from 45.3 +/- 5.1% (control) to 26.6 +/- 4.0% (p < 0.05), whilst Nec-1i (1.74 mg/kg) was ineffective (37.8 +/- 6.0%). Stimulus-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in rat cardiomyocytes, as reflected by the time until mitochondrial depolarisation, was unaffected by Nec-1 or Nec-1i at 30 muM but increased at 100 muM i.e. 91% (p < 0.05 vs control) and 152% (p < 0.001) for Nec-1 and Nec-1i, respectively.\nConclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that necrostatins inhibit myocardial cell death and reduce infarct size, possibly via a mechanism independent of the MPTP. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMore recently sitosterol-induced death in macrophages was reported to be caspaseindependent and blocked by Nec-1, and again it was suggested that necroptosis (and autophagy) might be involved [13], although considerably more work will be required before necroptosis can be unequivocally confirmed as representing a distinct entity.Protection against I/R injury in the heart and the brain could involve similar mechanisms and this could extend to the particular cell-signaling pathways or enzymes that are activated or down-regulated during the recovery process [14]. As Nec-1 has been shown to limit cellular damage in the brain we decided to ascertain whether it could produce a similar action in the myocardium. To investigate this we used a variety of in vitro experimental models.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe advent of newer and possibly more potent forms of the necrostatins will also assist in this process [22].In conclusion, as discussed by Degterev et al. [12] necrosis and apoptosis play key roles in a variety of pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction, and the identification of compounds such as the necrostatins which may target the proposed alternative death pathway, necroptosis, may lead to the development of more effective therapies. Our data are the first to indicate that necrostatin is protective against I/R injury in the myocardium, possibly via mechanisms other than those that are generally accepted as being involved (i.e. apoptosis and necrosis) [23]. It should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies. Thus, we intend to carry out further, more probing investigations, including in human tissue, (1) to obtain information regarding the therapeutic window for necrostatins, (2) to establish if necroptosis is, indeed, a feature of the degenerative changes occurring in myocardial infarction, (3) to determine the significance of necroptosis in relation to the other forms of cell death that occur in MI, and, (4) to elucidate potential cellular mechanisms underlying such a process in the myocardium.Fig. 11Fig.1Chemical structures of Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and its \"inactive\" analogue necrostatin-1i (Nec-1i)\nFig. 3 Fig. 2 a32Fig.3The times until the initiation of mitochondrial depolarisation i.e.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Evidence was obtained for different sites of binding of different antibodies and direct correspondence was observed between these sites and the locations of antigenic sites A, B, and E defined by determining the amino acids recognized by the specific antibodies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n3) presumably because of the binding of a second antibody to an unoccupied equivalent region of the BHA trimer is sterically prevented by the first antibody bound.The sites of antibody binding and the locations of amino acid substitutions in the BIIAs of antigenie variants can also be considered in relation to the thxee-dimensional structure of the BHA, Fig. 6. These considerations indicate that the sites of amino acid substitution are in all four cases appropriately located to be involved directly in the antibody-binding sites. In the case of HC31 they also indicate the basis of the steric inhibition of the binding of a second antibody to the BHA. Since the three 198 residues recognized are only 15 A apart around the threefold axis of the trimer, the BHA is effectively monovalent at this site. The results therefore substantiate the positions of antigenic sites A, B, and E and in the ease of site B give an indication of the extent of this region at the distal tip of the BHA molecule. It would also be of interest to examine antibodies specific for sites C and D but we have not characterized antibodies prepared against X-31 virus which recognize amino acids in these sites.FIG.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe nucleotide sequence changes determined in the HA1 regions of appropriate antigenic variants, which serve to define the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies used, are given in Table 1.Electron microscopy.BHA was dilnted in PBS (pH 7.2) to 50 pg/ml for optimum spreading on carbon support films. Antibody was added in increasing amounts until only a few molecules remained unbound to BHA after about 5 min equilibration. BHA-antibody complex suspensions were adsorbed to thin carbon films freshly stripped from mica, floated on a 1% w/v solution of sodium silicotungstate (pH 7.0) and then air dried. Micrographs were taken under minimum dose conditions known from analyses of periodic specimens to preserve detail below 1.5 nm; defocus was such that phase contrast was transferred in a continuous band down to about 1.0 nm (Wrigley et al., 1983). amination of the other antibody combinations although the position and binding angle of HC3; HC19, and HC45 are less easy to distinguish from one another than from HC31.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDISCUSSIONThese results directly demonstrate the sites of binding of four monoclonal antibodies of different specificities to the X-31 BHA. That the sites are different in detail for the different antibodies may be deduced from the observations that the angles formed between Fab regions and the BHA are constant and different for each antibody. The observation that these angles are constant irrespective of the type of complex observed, 1 + 1, 1 + 2,2 + 2, RHAantibody, etc., is allowed by the axial-rotation and flexing properties of the switch and hinge regions of the antibody molecules (Wrigley et ab, 1983).Differences in the sites of antibody binding on the BHA can also be observed directly even at this level of resolution (probably about 2 nm). For example HC45 clearly binds at a site away from an end of the BHA molecule whereas HC31 binds squarely on an end. This location of the HC31 antibody-binding site is supported by the observation of restricted complex formation.

We have also examined whether thermal behavior can emerge in systems that do not obey ETH when the initial state is produced by a quench.

Most recently, the first active specific immunotherapeutic approach, a cancer vaccine, has passed the final phase of human testing and its approval by the FDA is pending. However, evidence suggests that the full protective and therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines has not yet been achieved. Through multiple mechanisms, tumors promote conditions in the tumor-bearing host that mitigate or even eliminate the vaccine-induced antitumor response. Restoration of the impaired immune function is, therefore, imperative for achieving optimum vaccine efficacy. Targeted pharmacological interventions are capable of overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, and thereby enable cancer vaccination to reach its full therapeutic potential. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n67 recruitment of bone-marrow-derived cells Tumorrecruited bonemarrowderived cells (BMDCs) mediate tumorinduced immune suppression, promote tumor vascularization, and stimulate tumor meta stasis. [68][69][70][71] BMDCs represent a mixed cell population that includes hematopoietic progenitor cells, myeloid cells, and precursors of endothelial and stromal cells. Seemingly, tumor growth and metastatic develop ment can be prevented by reducing the trafficking of BMDCs into tumor sites (Figure 3). 25 Several mol ecules and mechanisms can modulate tumormediated recruitment of BMDCs, including veGF receptors and chemokine CXCL12-CXCR4mediated pathways. 17,[72][73][74][75][76][77] Overexpression of veGF promotes mobilization of veGFR1 + CXCR4 + BMDCs into the peripheral blood, and thus promotes immuno suppression. Tumorderived veGF also inhibits differentiation of DCs and promotes accumulation of MDSCs in the tumorbearing host.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIncreased production of immature myeloid cells in cancer patients: a mechanism of immunosuppression in cancer\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBAlmand\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ.

It is well known that in these processes cell movements can be guided by gradients of various chemical signals. In this study, we demonstrate that cell movement can also be guided by purely physical interactions at the cell-substrate interface. We cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 fibroblasts on flexible polyacrylamide sheets coated with type I collagen. A transition in rigidity was introduced in the central region of the sheet by a discontinuity in the concentration of the bis-acrylamide cross-linker. Cells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate \"durotaxis.\" In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe differences in traction forces, cell speed, and spreading area were statistically significant (p \u03ed 0.02, 0.0001, and 0.0003, respectively).  pieces of tissue explants are plated millimeters apart on collagen gels (Harris et al., 1981). In reality, the movement of cells within a complex organism or embryo is probably guided by a complex interplay among chemical and physical signals, which may include substrate rigidity as well as forces generated by fluid shear and cell-cell interactions.While the current observations provide direct evidence for the guidance of cell migration by substrate rigidity and mechanical forces, related phenomena have been reported in recent decades. For example, Kolega observed that stretching with a microneedle causes an epithelial cell to withdraw its lateral protrusion while maintaining its dimension along the direction of tension (Kolega, 1986). With neurons, similar manipulations were found to stimulate the elongation of neurite, a phenomenon referred to as \"towed growth\" (Bray, 1984;Lamoureux et al., 1989;Chada et al., 1997).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFrom these observations, one may predict that cells are capable of responding to substrate rigidity through a true active tactile exploration process, by exerting contractile forces and then interpreting the substrate deformation to determine a preferred direction or destination of their movements (Pelham and Wang, 1997;Sheetz et al., 1998).Our approach to testing this hypothesis consists of putting motile National Institutes of Health 3T3 cells on collagencoated polyacrylamide substrates with a rigidity gradient, under conditions such that the only way the cells can detect this stiffness gradient is by a process of active tactile exploration. Our results indicate that 3T3 fibroblasts can in-deed detect and respond to substrate stiffness. Furthermore, the cell consistently migrates in the direction of increasing stiffness. To confirm the involvement of a force-sensing mechanism, we have also shown that the direction of cell movement can be guided by manipulating mechanical strain within the flexible substrate. The observed coupling between strain and movement is exactly as required to produce a preference for hard materials. Parallel measurements indicate that cells generate stronger traction forces and spread to a larger size on stiff substrates than on soft substrates.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nCells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces.

The aim of this study was thus to test the hypothesis that core members of the mammalian Hippo pathway are expressed in skeletal muscle and that the transcriptional co-factor Yap, a core member of the Hippo pathway, regulates C2C12 myogenesis. We found that the major components of the mammalian Hippo pathway including Yap are all expressed in skeletal muscles, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. In C2C12 myoblasts, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low and Yap localises to nuclei. Upon differentiation, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increases approximately 20-fold and Yap translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol. To test whether the observed increase of Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is required for differentiation we overexpressed hYAP1 S127A, a mutant that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127, in C2C12 myoblasts. We found that overexpression of hYAP S127A prevented myotube formation, whereas the overexpression of wildtype hYAP1 or empty vector had no effect. In addition, more hYAP1 S127A overexpressing cells progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle and the expression of MRFs (myogenin, Myf5), Mef2c and cell cycle regulators (p21, cyclin D1) was significantly changed when compared to wildtype hYAP1 and empty vector overexpressing cells. This data suggests that the phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 leads to a changed expression of MRFs and cell cycle regulators and is required for C2C12 myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nYap is unphosphorylated and localises to the nucleus in C2C12 myoblasts. At the onset of differentiation Yap becomes phosphorylated at Ser127 and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Ser127 phosphorylation is required for terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells because if the concentration of Yap that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127 is increased by overexpressing a hYAP1 S127A mutant then myoblasts withdraw less from the cell cycle and do not differentiate into myotubes (see Fig. S4 for a schematic drawing). We therefore identify Yap as a novel regulator of C2C12 myogenesis.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1. Core components of the mammalian Hippo pathway including Yap are ubiquitously expressed in a range of mouse tissues including skeletal muscle.

We first monitored the localisation and phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 during myogenesis for which we used the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line as an in vitro model (Fig. 2). During C2C12 myogenesis, myoblasts first proliferate to confluency, withdraw from the cell cycle and then differentiate into myotubes upon a shift to differentiation medium containing lower concentrations of mitogens. We found that Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low in myoblasts but after 24 h in differentiation medium Ser127 phosphorylation is %20-fold increased and after 96 h it is %28-fold higher than in myoblasts, respectively (Fig. 2A, see also Fig. S1a in the Supplementary data for a quantification).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To identify genes governing endolysosomal dynamics, we conducted a global fluorescence-based screen to reveal endomembrane effector genes. Screening implicated Phox (PX) domain\u2013containing protein Mdm1 in endomembrane dynamics. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that Mdm1 is a novel interorganelle tethering protein that localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013vacuole/lysosome membrane contact sites (MCSs). We show that Mdm1 is ER anchored and contacts the vacuole surface in trans via its lipid-binding PX domain. Strikingly, overexpression of Mdm1 induced ER\u2013vacuole hypertethering, underscoring its role as an interorganelle tether. We also show that Mdm1 and its paralogue Ydr179w-a (named Nvj3 in this study) localize to ER\u2013vacuole MCSs independently of established tether Nvj1. Finally, we find that Mdm1 truncations analogous to neurological disease\u2013associated SNX14 alleles fail to tether the ER and vacuole and perturb sphingolipid metabolism. Our work suggests that human Mdm1 homologues may play previously unappreciated roles in interorganelle communication and lipid metabolism. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThey further suggest that mitochondria-vacuole membrane contact sites (MCSs) are regions of phospholipid exchange, which, together with ER-mitochondrial encounter structures, are essential for mitochondrial lipid metabolism (Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014;H\u00f6nscher et al., 2014).In addition to mitochondria, the ER also forms MCSs with endosomes and lysosomes (vacuoles in yeast; Pan et al., 2000;Eden et al., 2010;Friedman et al., 2013;Rowland et al., 2014). Indeed, EM studies showed that the ER and endosomes are closely juxtaposed, allowing the ER-resident phosphatase PTP1B to regulate the sorting of EGF receptors at late endosomes in trans (Eden et al., 2010). Additionally, the endosomal sterol-binding protein STARD3 has recently been proposed to bind in trans to ER-localized vesicle-associated proteins, thereby localizing sterol transfer to ER-endosome MCSs (Alpy et al., 2013).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nER contact sites define the position and timing of endosome fission\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAARowland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPJChitwood\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMJPhillips\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGKVoeltz\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.023\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t159\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMarch 2025 mdm1 is an er-vacuole tether in yeast \u2022 Henne et al. ebellar ataxia and intellectual disability syndrome\n\t\t\n\t\t\tACThomas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWilliams\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNSet\u00f3-Salvia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCBacchelli\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDJenkins\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMO'sullivan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKMengrelis\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMIshida\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLOcaka\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEChanudet\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.10.007\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMutations in SNX14 cause a distinctive autosomal-recessive cer-Downloaded from\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2014\n\t\t\t95\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEndoplasmic reticulum-endosome contact increases as endosomes traffic and mature\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJRFriedman\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tJRDibenedetto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMWest\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAARowland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGKVoeltz\n\t\t\n\t\t10.1091/mbc.E12-10-0733\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMol.

During reperfusion after filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion, ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels increased in ischemic mouse brain. Ischemic injury decreased after intracerebroventricular injections of ICE-like protease inhibitors, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.FMK), acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, or a relatively selective inhibitor of CPP32-like caspases, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, but not a cathepsin B inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone. z-VAD.FMK decreased ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive IL-1\u03b2 levels in ischemic mouse brain and reduced tissue damage when administered to rats as well. Only z-VAD.FMK and acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone reduced brain swelling, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone did not attenuate the ischemia-induced increase in tissue IL-1\u03b2 levels. The three cysteine protease inhibitors significantly improved behavioral deficits, thereby showing that functional recovery of ischemic neuronal tissue can follow blockade of enzymes associated with apoptotic cell death. Finally, we examined the effect of z-VAD.FMK on excitotoxicity and found that it protected against \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-induced or to a lesser extent N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced excitotoxic brain damage. Thus, ICE-like and CPP32-like caspases contribute to mechanisms of cell death in ischemic and excitotoxic brain injury and provide therapeutic targets for stroke and neurodegenerative brain damage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTwenty-two hours later, the brains were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for morphometric analysis. z-VAD.FMK (8, 27, or 80 ng) was injected i.c.v. 15 min before ischemia and 10 min after reperfusion in 2 equal doses (4 l per dose; 1.5 mm lateral, 0.8 mm posterior from bregma, 4.0 mm below bone surface).Neurological Deficit. Mice and rats were tested for neurological deficits and scored as described by Bederson et al. (41) with the following minor modification: 0, no observable neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to extend right forepaw (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side (moderate); 3, loss of walking or righting reflex (severe). The rater was naive to the treatment group, and assessments were made at 10 min and 2 hr during ischemia, and again 18 hr after reperfusion.Western Blot Analysis.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe left MCA was occluded with an 8-0 nylon monofilament (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) coated with a mixture of silicone resin (Xantopren; Bayer Dental, Osaka) and a hardener (Elastomer Activator; Bayer Dental) as described (37,38). The procedure lasted 15 min, and the anesthesia was discontinued. Two hours later, animals were briefly re-anesthetized with halothane, and the filament was withdrawn. Eighteen hours after reperfusion, the forebrains were divided into five coronal (2-mm) sections using a mouse brain matrix (RBM-2000C; Activational Systems, Warren, MI), and the sections were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma). The infarcted areas were quantitated by an image-analysis system (Bioquant IV; R & M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) and calculated by summing the volumes of each section determined directly (39) or indirectly by the following formula: contralateral hemisphere (mm 3 ) \u03ea ipsilateral undamaged volume (mm 3 ; ref. 40).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nInfarct sparing was particularly noted in posterior forebrain (coronal sections from 6 to 10 mm). Neurological deficits were significantly reduced after 18 hr but not immediately upon reperfusion. The neurological score was somewhat better after the injection of 240 ng rather than 80 ng, although the differences were not statistically significant.Neuroprotection sustained for at least 3 days [152 \u03ee 5 (n \u03ed 4) vs. 75 \u03ee 30 mm 3 (n \u03ed 5) for vehicle-treated and z-VAD.FMKtreated (80 ng) groups, respectively].

Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or non-subcellular resolution. It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCR is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins, or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein activation, or that internalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response. Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternate interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCR are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR, and its cognate G protein, Gs in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIt has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCR is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins 2,3 , or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein activation [4][5][6][7][8][9] , or that\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\ninternalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response 10 .

BBB compromise has been found in many pathological conditions, including neuroinflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), a chemokine that is transiently and significantly up-regulated during inflammation, is able to disrupt the integrity of BBB and modulate the progression of various diseases, including excitotoxic injury and hemorrhage. In this review, we first introduce the biochemistry and biology of MCP1, and then summarize the effects of MCP1 on BBB integrity as well as individual BBB components. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nZO-1, the first identified accessory protein [101] that links occludin to actin cytoskeleton [102], plays a critical role in regulating BBB permeability. Dissociation of ZO-1 from the tight junctions has been shown to accompany the disruption of BBB [70,71,[103][104][105]. In addition, ZO-1 has been detected in the nucleus and shown to co-localize with transcription factors in some conditions [106][107][108][109], suggesting its potential role as a signaling molecule.BMeCs as the major barrier of BBB have been under extensive investigations. Accumulating evidence shows that MCP1 compromises BBB integrity via redistribution of tight junction proteins from cell-cell border (probable via endocytosis) and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in BMeCs [65][66][67]72]. we have previously been able to verify these data and further show that these changes are dependent on plasmin activity [71]. Mechanistic studies reveal that phosphorylation of TJP regulates their functions and locations [95,96,[110][111][112].\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA large number of molecules have been reported to affect the permeability of BBB, such as MCP1, TNF-\u03b1, .Here, we focus on the effect of MCP1 on BBB integrity.It has been shown that injection of recombinant mouse MCP1 into the brain disrupts BBB integrity [65-67, 71, 72]. we have previously been able to further demonstrate that plasmin-mediated truncation of MCP1 is indispensable for MCP1-induced BBB compromise [71]. Consistent with our report, tPA, which converts inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, has been found to promote BBB disruption and subsequent peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) infiltration [73]. Additionally, BBB compromise and PBMC infiltration have also been found in mice deficient for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [74], suggesting that the effect of MCP1 on BBB is dependent on plasmin activity. MCP1, however, failed to compromise BBB integrity in CCR2 -/-mice [67], suggesting that the effect of MCP1 on BBB also depends on CCR2. The next question then becomes how exactly MCP1-CCR2 axis affects the integrity of BBB.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTight junctions of the bloodbrain barrier: development, composition and regulation\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHWolburg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tALippoldt\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tvascul Pharmacol\n\t\t\n\t\t\t38\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2002\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTumor necrosis factor alpha expression produces increased bloodbrain barrier permeability following temporary focal cerebral ischemia in mice\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGYYang\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCGong\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tZQin\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tXHLiu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLorrisBetz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tA\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBrain Res Mol Brain Res\n\t\t\n\t\t\t69\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1999\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMouse MCP1 C-terminus inhibits human MCP1-induced chemotaxis and BBB compromise\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYYao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTsirkaSe\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Neurochem\n\t\t\n\t\t\t118\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTruncation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by plasmin promotes blood-brain barrier disruption\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYYao\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTsirkaSe\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJ Cell Sci\n\t\t\n\t\t\t124\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t2011\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show here that four glycoproteins are integral components of the dystrophin complex and that the concentration of one of these is greatly reduced in DMD patients. Thus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.DuCHENNE muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene located on the X chromosome. Dystrophin, the high-molecular weight protein product of the DMD gene 1 , is localized to the sarcolemmal membrane of normal skeletal muscle 2 -5 but is absent from the skeletal muscle of people with DMD 1 \u2022 2 \u2022 6 , xmd dogs 7 and mdx mice 1 \u2022 5 (the last two being possible animal models for DMD). The amino-acid sequence of dystrophin suggests that it is a membrane cytoskeletal protein 8 \u2022 9 involved in the anchoring of sarcolemmal proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton. But the exact function of dystrophin and its precise role in the resulting necrosis of dystrophic muscle fibres has not been determined.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor example, muscle from mdx mice shows elevated intracellular ionized Ca 2 + levels and corresponding higher net degradation of muscle proteins 20 \u2022 Loss of a dystrophin-anchored protein with a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium could result in elevated intracellular calcium levels and lead to the reported activation of calciumdependent protease activities 21 \u2022 Such a mechanism could explain the abnormal muscle protein degradation and fibre necrosis of dystrophic muscle.The absence of dystrophin-associated proteins in dystrophic muscle may complicate the therapeutic efficacy of myoblast transfer 22 , as the reintroduction of dystrophin synthesis might not lead to recovery of associated protein levels and thus could necessitate treatment at only one particular developmental stage. Finally, a deficiency or defect in a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein could perhaps explain the DMD-like symptoms observed in suspected autosomal-recessive patients 23 \u2022 24 that express apparently normal dystrophin.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn studies of other genetic diseases involving proteins of the cytoskeleton 10 ' 11 , the absence of one component is sometimes accompanied by the loss of another cytoskeletal protein. Therefore, to understand the molecular pathogenesis of DMD, we sought to identify the proteins associated with or bound to dystrophin and to characterize the status of these proteins in muscle where dystrophin is absent.Recently, we have shown that dystrophin can be isolated from detergent-solubilized skeletal muscle membranes using wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose, because of its tight association with a WGA-binding glycoprotein 12 \u2022 This indicates that the localization of dystrophin to the cytoplasmic face of the sarcolemma 2 -5 results from a tight association of dystrophin with an integral membrane glycoprotein.

They exhibit a significantly improved dispersibility in organic solvents such as\ntetrahydrofurane and dichloromethane. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the latter solvent no sedimentation was observed for a period of one month. The particle size of the agglomerates in the suspensions was reduced from several micron (pristine ND: \u223c 15 \u03bcm, ND-OH: \u223c 6 \u03bcm) to 300-450 nm in the case of ND-OOC-C 3 H 7 (2), 150-260 nm for ND-OOC-C 5 H 11 (3), \u223c170 nm for ND-OOC-C 12 H 23 (4), and 170-300 nm for ND-OOC-C 18 H 37 (5). Fig. 3 shows the development of suspensions of pristine detonation diamond and compounds 1-5 in dichloromethane.The stable dispersion of functionalised nanodiamond in organic solvents opens the way to further surface modification in more homogeneous systems leading to better accessibility of the surface groups as well as a more homogeneous distribution of the diamond particles in the medium. Carboxylic groups with terminal surface groups have to be reacted with the diamond surface if further reactions are to be carried out. This work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOn the other hand, their surface can be functionalised with a variety of groups in order to incorporate them into polymer matrices, surface coatings and the like [3]. An essential prerequisite for these applications is the control of surface structure and particle size and agglomeration.So far, different approaches for the surface functionalisation and deagglomeration have been taken. Chiganova produced diamond hydrosols from oxidized detonation diamond [4], whereas Xu and coworkers used surface active compounds for the dispersion of nanodiamond particles [5]. Khabashesku et al. obtained small agglomerates of \u223c160 nm in size by the fluorination of detonation diamond [6]. These particles formed stable suspensions in THF. Another approach is the mechanical deagglomeration in suspension by stirred media milling [7] or beads assisted sonic disintegration [8].Covalent surface modification of nanodiamond has been reported by several authors. Reactions with fluorine [6], chlorine [9], ammonia [10] and hydrogen [10,11] lead to homogenized, surface modified nanodiamond materials with increased reactivity and the option for further functionalisation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\nConclusionIn summary we have modified the surface of hydroxylated detonation nanodiamond with alkyl chains of different length by an esterification reaction of carboxylic acid chlorides with the surface hydroxyl groups. The resulting materials had a surface loading of 0.3-0.4 mmol g -1 and showed a much better dispersibility in several organic solvents along with a smaller particle size of the remaining agglomerates. This enables the homogeneous incorporation of such materials in non-hydrophilic matrices and further modification in stable suspension. In the future, it will be important to further reduce the agglomerate size by such chemical deagglomeration and stabilization techniques down to the primary particles.Fig. 2 .2Fig. 2.

These methods have begun to unravel key questions in cancer biology that have been difficult to address with bulk tumor measurements. Over the past five years, there has been extraordinary progress in technological developments and research applications, but these efforts represent only the tip of the iceberg. In the coming years, SCS will greatly improve our understanding of invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance during cancer progression. These tools will also have direct translational applications in the clinic, in areas such as early detection, noninvasive monitoring, and guiding targeted therapy. In this perspective, I discuss the progress that has been made and the myriad of unexplored applications that still lie ahead in cancer research and medicine. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn summary, combining SCS methods with GEMs and xenografts provides a powerful experimental system for studying clonal dynamics, metastasis, and potentially also therapeutic response.\nTranslational applications of SCS in the clinicSingle-cell DNA and RNA sequencing methods have a myriad of translational applications, including diagnostics, prognostics, targeted therapy, early detection, and noninvasive monitoring. In diagnostics, intratumor heterogeneity presents a formidable challenge for clinical sampling, because single samples may not accurately represent the tumor as a whole. SCS methods can resolve intratumor heterogeneity and provide accurate measures of genomic diversity, which can be used to calculate a \"diversity index.\" These indexes are likely to have prognostic utility in predicting which cancer patients will be more likely to show poor response to therapy, higher probability of metastasis, or have poor overall survival (Burrell et al. 2013;Murugaesu et al. 2013;Almendro et al. 2014).Another important clinical application of SCS methods is to guide targeted therapy.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2014).Another important clinical application of SCS methods is to guide targeted therapy. By sequencing and comparing multiple single cells, it is possible to construct a phylogenetic tree and heatmap that reveals the clonal substructure of a tumor. These genetic trees will allow oncologists to identify founder mutations in the \"trunk\" of the tree, which are ideal therapeutic targets, since they occurred early in tumor evolution and were inherited by all cells in the tumor. Alternatively, these trees can be used to devise combination therapies to target multiple tumor subpopulations independently.Early detection is another clinical application of SCS, which can provide genomic information on rare tumor cells. In samples collected from bodily fluids (blood, urine, feces, and phlegm), it may be possible to isolate single cancer cells at the earliest stages of cancer progression. If driver mutations can be identified in multiple single cancer cells, then they may represent a clonal expansion, which could be followed by imaging techniques and surgical resection of microlesions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs DNA-and RNA-SCS methods continue to mature, their translation into the clinic is inevitable and will have a major impact on patient lives.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

A circularly polarized light is completely converted to the cross-polarized light which can either be bent or focused tightly near the diffraction limit. It depends on a precise control of the optical-axis profile of the antennas on a subwavelength scale, in which the rotation angle of the optical axis has a simple linear relationship to the phase discontinuity. Such an approach enables effective wave front engineering within a subwavelength scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1. Illustration of the phase transformation through structured metamaterial surface. (a) The unit cell geometric parameter for the metallic split ring aperture utilized here and its equivalent effective medium under rotation with their optical axis, the thickness of the metamaterial is h = 0.2a, the gap of the aperture w = 0.1a, and the side length of square aperture is b = 0.6a; (b) Light with well defined circular polarization (left-handed depicted here) gets scattered by the metamaterial surface, leading to the formation of the linear or parabolic phase variation at the output plane through rotating localized optical axes in a well designed manner, bending or focusing transmitted light according to the additional linear or parabolic phase discontinuity; (c) Schematic of the geometrical parameters of the structured surface investigated here. For structure A, the linear rotation is implemented, the position of each metallic aperture is at x = na, and the rotation angle is 0.1n \u03b8 \u03c0 =\nFig. 2 .2Fig. 2. Illustration of the additional linear phase discontinuity through structured metamaterial surface.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIf we assume the plane wave is normally incident to the metamaterial surface, the refraction angle is governed by sin( 2 )t d dx \u03b1 \u03bb \u03c0 = \u03a6, where the refractive index in the refracted region is assumed to be vacuum, i.e. 1t n = . The linear phase variation, i.e. the gradient of the linear phase variation d dx \u03a6 being constant, can bend the incident wave at an angle. According to our scheme for the linear phase variation, the gradient of the phase variation is 2 /G k d dx D \u03c0 =\u03a6 =, where D is the total width of the antennas array and the rotation angle ranges from 0 to \u03c0 .\nB: Parabolic phase discontinuity:In fact, the linear phase relationship is only one possibility to manipulate the wave front. As another representative example, as a one-dimensional variation, we can generate a phase discontinuity profile according to:2 2 2 2 ( ) f f x x \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03bb \u03bb + \u03a6 = -(4)With such a parabolic profile, we can focus the incident light (wavelength \u03bb ) to a distance f beyond the metamaterial surface, where f is the focal length.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy using a circularly polarized light (instead of linear polarization) impinging on the metamaterial, it can be completely converted to the cross-polarized light without the residual power in the original polarization, which can occupy larger than half of the transmitted power in the double-resonance scheme with linear polarization. Moreover, the phase control becomes intuitive that the spatial variation of the phase discontinuity has a simple linear relationship to the rotation angle of the optical-axis profile, as in one type of Q-plates [15]. Linear and parabolic phase variations for the opticalaxis profile are investigated in order to bend or tightly focus the incident light near the diffraction limit.\nPhase discontinuity through rotation of optical axesIn order to provide a full control of the wave front, it is essential to obtain the phase variation in the whole range from 0 to 2 \u03c0 , while sustaining the equal amplitude of the light from different positions. Here, we introduce an alternative framework (other than the doubleresonance scheme) in modifying the wave front with the phase discontinuities though optical axis rotation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}
