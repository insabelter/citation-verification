This paper proposes a fault analysis method of motors based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis. To achieve this goal, fault fuzzy production rules of three-phase induction motors are first proposed. Then, the rMFRSNPS is presented to model the rules, which provides an intuitive way for modelling the motors. Moreover, to realize the parallel data computing and information reasoning in the fault prediction and diagnosis process, three reasoning algorithms for the rMFRSNPS are proposed: the pulse value reasoning algorithm, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm, and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm. Finally, some case studies are given, in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n-us, they cannot effectively diagnose multiple faults, not achieving the requirement of performing an overall fault analysis of the whole machine. -erefore, how to improve the abovementioned fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis methods or put forward new ones is the main issue in the corresponding engineering domain for the motors.

These correlations outputs might show some detour versus experimental ones; however less costs of researchers encouraged researchers to follow that field to present more accurate correlations at various working conditions  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The expensive steps of stabilize and dispersing the nanoparticles, are able to be ignored through the numerical works; moreover all the nanofluid behaviors can be predicted by a simple optimization approach according to the available empirical results. Among these optimization approaches, the artificial neural network (ANN) was used in many studies to predict the nanofluid properties especially for its thermal conductivity and viscosity. Moreover appropriate accuracy of this method encouraged researchers to develop more new models of ANN to have better consistency with the existence physical conditions of a nanofluid flow . In the following, 24 dissimilar ANN methods are examined at present work by introducing the suitable architectures and training algorithms of these using approaches.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nThe mixture composed of nanoparticles dispersed through a base liquid, which is called nanofluid, plays a significant role in MEMS & NEMS. It should be mentioned that the nanoparticles concentration have be small to avoid from undesired behaviors such as settlements. The Brownian motions of nanoparticles are able to increase the convection mechanism through the base fluid; however their main important effect would be improve the mixture effective thermal conductivity. That implies the better performance of nanoparticles with more thermal conductivity coefficient. This fact has been reported in many articles for various types of nanoparticles  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Meanwhile, the amount of nanoparticles concentration has an important influence on the mixture thermal behavior especially at different values of working temperature. Other effective thermo-physical properties can be addressed as like the nanoparticles density, specific heat and their shapes and diameters. It is well known that in addition of nanofluid thermal conductivity, the mixture effective viscosity should be evaluated due to its performance in a flow pumping power; so that a large number of works can be referred concerned these aspects of nanofluid properties.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo do this, the MSEs between the targets and the ANN outputs of the examined methods are evaluated while the results would be supported by the appropriate sensitivity analysis.\n\nProblem statement\nThe artificial neural network (ANN) optimization method is evaluated according to the experimental results of Bahrami et al.  [10]  concerned the hybrid non-Newtonian nanofluid of iron (Fe) and copper oxide (CuO) in a binary mixture of water and ethylene glycol (see Fig.  1 ).

Present work novelty is demonstrated by providing 24 dissimilar ANN methods to introduce the suitable architectures and training algorithms for them .

Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe second study analyzed 325 patients with 173 in the propofol group and 152 in the sevoflurane group. No difference was observed in the overall 5-year survival rate between two groups, although the propofol group did have a lower rate of cancer recurrence (p = 0.037)  [48] . The third study collected 2645 cases, which included 2589 in the volatile anesthesia group and 56 in the propofol group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative recurrence or survival probability  [49] . Taken together, these studies suggest that propofol may either improve overall survival rates or lower the rate of cancer recurrence, but the evidence is not overwhelming. It is good to consider the limitations of these studies. First, there is the inherent limitation of retrospective studies in that they do not standardize clinical care and do not randomize patient groups. Therefore, the effects of confounding factors and selection bias cannot be easily eliminated. Second, one of the studies (Lee et al.  [49] ) had a relative small patient population and another (Kim et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, the free propofol concentration employed in the in vitro cell culture experiments may be 50-500 times that of the clinical concentrations. This would be a lethal dose for humans. Future in vitro experiments should be designed to take protein binding into account.\n\nPropofol and the immune system\nSurgical trauma is associated with an increase of cytokines and stress hormones in the plasma during the vulnerable peri-operative period  [17] . This stress response  induces transient suppression of cell-mediated immunity, the primary immune-defense against the invasion of tumor cells and micro-metastasis  [33] . Surgery and anesthesia could suppress the immune response by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system  [34] . Anesthetics may also directly affect the functions of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T cells, mononuclear cells and dendritic cells  [35, 36] . NK cells are large, granular cytotoxic lymphocytes that naturally recognize malignant cells, and induce lysis without prior sensitization. Low perioperative levels of NK activity are associated with an increased cancer related morbidity and mortality in humans  [37] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe effect could be attributable to either the vertebral block, propofol or both  [46] .\n\nPropofol and clinical trials in breast cancer\nThree retrospective studies have compared propofol with volatile anesthetic agents on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery (Table  2 ). The first study, published in 2014 by Enlund and colleagues, reviewed surgical data from 1837 breast cancer patients with 620 in the propofol group and 1217 in the sevoflurane group. Differences in overall survival rates (propofol vs sevoflurane) for breast cancer were 3% (95% confidence interval, 1 to 4%, p < 0.001) at 1 year, and 2% (-2 to 6%, non-significant) at 5 years, in favor of propofol. However, the observed differences were eliminated after adjustment for confounders (history of cardiac ischemia was 1.8 times more likely in the sevoflurane group)  [47] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In Chagas disease, pleiotropic cytokine TNF is considered key in immunopathology. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the levels of TNF, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in the serum of patients with chronic Chagas disease. TNF and its soluble receptors were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array in the serum of 132 patients, of which 51 had the indeterminate form (IND), 39 the mild cardiac form (CARD 1), 42 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 non-infected individuals (NI). The results indicate that the soluble receptors may regulate TNF in Chagas disease, as their leves were higher in T. cruzi-infected individuals when compared to non-infected individuals. We found a moderate negative correlation between sTNFR1 and TNF in individuals with the IND form, suggesting a relationship with non-progression to more severe forms, such as heart disease. sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were increased in all clinical forms, but with a moderate positive correlation in more severe patients (r = 0.50 and p = 0.0005). TNF levels showed no statistical differences in the groups of patients. These findings suggest the importance of the endogenous balance of the levels of soluble TNF receptors in the protection and balance in patients with chronic Chagas disease, besides revealing the immunological complexity in chronic T. cruzi-infected individuals. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs perspectives, we aim to address the mechanisms of TNFR activity in the peripheral blood cell from Chagas disease patients. Studies on cytokine profiles and frequency of receptors involved in apoptosis would also contribute to a better understanding of the immunopathology of chronic Chagas disease. \n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n\nDiego\n\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, evaluating soluble receptors, which are inhibitors of this cytokine, may improve the understanding of the chronic clinical evolution of the infection as well as the search for new immunological biomarkers.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPopulation and study site -This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the FIOCRUZ/PE committee (CAAE: 0022.0.095.000-07 and 0032.095.000-10). All subjects signed written informed consent forms in accordance with the the guidelines of CNS Resolution 466/2012 of the National Health Council/Ministry of Health of Brazil.. One-hundred and thirty-two patients chronic with Chagas disease were selected at the Outpatient Clinic for Chagas Disease and Cardiac Insufficiency of the Cardiac Emergency Department of Pernambuco (PROCAPE)/University of Pernambuco (UPE). Individuals who had received previous treatment with Benznidazole and/or who presented with digestive complaints were excluded from the study. The clinical classification was performed by cardiologists following the II Brazilian Consensus on Chagas disease  (Dias et al., 2016) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIndividuals with the IND form present a less inflammatory profile but with persistence of the parasite  (Curvo et al., 2018) . We also believe that this decrease in TNF is related to the lack of activation of a Th1 profile or that other cell profiles, such as Th17, contribute more to the intracellular elimination of T. cruzi. Therefore other cytokines should be evaluated, such as IL-10 and IL-17  (Cai et al., 2016) . In in vitro models, IL-10 acts inhibiting the pro-inflammatory activity of TNF indirectly by increasing soluble receptors and decreasing transmembrane receptors or by directly inhibiting TNF release  (Joyce et al., 1994) .\n\nConclusion\nAll findings suggest the importance of the endogenous balance of soluble TNF receptors, which may indicate protection to patients with chronic Chagas disease. In addition, the TNF/TNFR1 route seems to be paramount in the course of the disease in humans. Our results on TNF cytokine corroborate other recent studies and highlight the complexity of the immune response against T. cruzi in chronic CD.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We investigated the association of physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process with blood glucose level. Methods 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET scans acquired from 44 patients (male:female=20:24, age=50.8\u00b114.8y [mean\u00b1SD]) were retrospectively analyzed. The blood glucose level (BGL) was examined before 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC injection. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and patients with BGL over 200\u00a0mg/dl were excluded. 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake was measured by the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). Additionally, SSTR-positive volume (SV) in the pancreas uncinate process was measured with two diferent thresholds: by SUV cutof of 2.5 (SV2.5) and 40% of SUVmax (SV40%). These measurements on 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC PET were correlated with BGL. Results The mean of SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process was 6.51\u00b12.04. SV2.5 was 17.81\u00b17.14 cm3 , and SV40% was 18.20\u00b18.83 cm3 . A signifcant negative correlation was found between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BGL (r=-0.37, p=0.01). The ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the pancreas body also showed a signifcance negative correlation with BGL (r=-0.40, p=0.01). SV2.5 (r=0.27, p=0.07) and SV40% (r=-0.151, p=0.32) were not signifcantly correlated with BGL. Conclusion Physiologic 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process was negatively correlated with BGL. Our results suggested that glycemia could afect physiologic uptake of 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-TOC. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe continuous variables were represented by mean \u00b1 SD. The correlation was analyzed by Pearson correlation, and a p value of 0.05 or lower was considered to be statistically significant.

Among 44 patient, 22 (50%) patients were diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, of which 9 patients with pancreatic NET, 8 patients with rectal NET, and 5 patients with other or unknown origins. Twelve patients (27%) were diagnosed as pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Other 10 (23%) patients were diagnosed with other tumors except NET including meningioma. Demographics and diagnosis of patients were summarized in Table  1 . BGL of 44 patients were 107.5 \u00b1 37.5 mg/dL (70-145 mg/dL), and the distribution of BGL is shown in Fig.  2 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and SUVmean of the normal pancreas body showed a significant negative correlation with BGL (r = -0.40, p = 0.01), and the ratio between SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process and BP SUVmean also showed a significant negative correlation with BGL (r = -0.34, p = 0.02). However, two volume measurements on 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET were not significantly correlated with BGL: r = 0.274 and p = 0.068 for the correlation between SV 2.5 and BGL and r = -0.15 and p = 0.32 for the correlation between SV 40% and BGL. There was no significant correlation between patient age and SUVmax of the pancreas uncinate process (r = -0.17, p = 0.27). Representative cases with high and low BGL are shown in Fig.  3 . The result of correlation analysis between BGL and 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET parameters is shown in Fig.  4 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the association between BGL and 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the pancreas uncinate process.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nPatients\nIn this retrospective study, 77 patients who underwent 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET scans at a single institution were evaluated, from December 2020 to January 2021. The demographic and clinical information of the enrolled patients are listed in Table  1 . One of 77 patients underwent two serial 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET scans with 51 days interval, and both exams were included for the analysis. Among of 78 studies, 19 were excluded because of the presence of tumor in the pancreas head and uncinate process or adjacent retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis. Four studies were excluded because those patients had a previous history of pancreatectomy. We excluded patients diagnosed as or suspected of diabetes: Six patients were diagnosed as diabetes, and four patients were suspected of diabetes because BGL was higher than 200 mg/dl.

Codon optimization is a frequently used strategy to accelerate protein synthesis rate. Besides regulating protein translation speed, codon usage bias has also be reported to affect co-translation folding and transcription. P. pastoris is a well-developed expression system, whose efficiency is tightly correlated with commercial value. However, few studies focus on the role of codon usage bias in affecting protein expression in P. pastoris. Besides, many genes in P. pastoris genome show significant negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency. It's not known whether this feature is important for their expression. In order to answer these questions, we picked 4P. pastoris gene candidates with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder. We then performed full-length codon optimization which completely eliminated the correlation. Protein and RNA assays were then used to compare protein and mRNA levels before and after codon optimization. As a result, codon optimization failed to elevate their protein expression levels, and even resulted in a decrease. As represented by the trypsin sensitivity assays, codon optimization also altered the protein structure of 0616 and 0788. Besides protein, codon optimization also affected mRNA levels. Shown by in vitro and in vivo RNA degradation assays, the mRNA stability of 0616, 0788 and 0135 were also altered by codon optimization. For each gene, the detailed effect may be related with its specific sequence and protein structure. Our results suggest that codon usage bias is an important factor to regulate gene expression level, as well as mRNA and protein stabilities in P. pastoris. \"Extreme\" codon optimization in genes with strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and protein structural disorder tendency may not be favored. Compromised strategies should be tried if expression is not successful. Besides, codon optimization may affect protein structural conformation more severely in structural disordered proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAlthough synonymous codon substitution does not alter amino acid sequence, the nucleotide sequence is then changed and is likely to affect the mRNA level in terms of transcription activity and mRNA stability  (Hia and Takeuchi, 2021) . It has been pointed out there was a potential correlation between gene sequence and transcription speed. Specific nucleotide pentamers (5 consecutive nucleotide bases) tended to have a specific transcription rate which was highly conserved in different genes  (Cohen et al., 2018) . Besides, a correlation between codon usage bias and nuclear RNA levels has also been reported in the genome of N. crassa. A batch of transcription factors or histone transmethylases might be involved in supporting this correlation  (Zhao et al., 2021) . In vivo studies in N. crassa showed that the transcriptional activity of luciferase increased with codon optimization, which was unrelated with translation. The inner mechanism was further revealed as reduced gene silencing marker H3K9me3 levels in codon optimized sequences  (Larrondo et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2016) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn order to examine whether this negative correlation is necessary and important for the proper expression of these genes, here we picked four gene candidates with different CAI value and disorder score. These four genes were PAS_FragD_0013, PAS_chr1-1_0135, PAS_chr1-4_0616 and PAS_chr4_0788. We then performed full-length codon optimization and compared protein levels as well as mRNA levels before and after optimization. Trypsin sensitivity assay was then performed to reveal possible protein structural change caused by codon optimization. mRNA stabilities of sequences with and without codon optimization were also compared. We hope that this study would add more information on how codon optimization affects P. pastoris protein expression profile and provide some guidance on codon optimization strategy development.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n\nStrains and culture conditions\nE. coli DH5\u03b1 strain was used for plasmid construction and propagation. DH5\u03b1 cells were cultured in LB medium, containing 0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone and 1.0% NaCl at 37 \u2022 C.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBesides, combining all trypsin sensitivity and solubility phenotypes so far, codon optimization seems to have a larger effect on structure alternation in genes whose protein product have larger structural disorder tendency (0376, disorder score 0.656; 0616, disorder score 0.679). Therefore, when dealing with this group of proteins, special codon optimization strategy may be needed. Here we only focus on \"extreme\" codon optimization, in which all codons are replaced by the most optimal synonymous codons. \"Extreme\" codon optimization may work well in most genes, however, may not be suitable for genes with strong negative correlation. \"Weaker\" codon optimization strategies by using secondary optimal codons or keeping some negative correlation patches may be tried to solve the problems.\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nMian Zhou: Project planning, Experimental design, Data analysis and Writing the manuscript.

Some require this external circuit to be changed during the run due to coagulopathy or mechanical failure. Circuit change(s) can result in massive fluid shifts, weight gain, and hemodynamic instability, with negative implications for the patient. Predictors for undergoing circuit changes and its impact on outcomes remain unclear. We hypothesized that circuit changes during ECMO support would correlate with increased morbidity and mortality.\nMethods\nPatients with one ECMO run lasting 30 days or less at a tertiary children\u2019s hospital between 2010-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. LASSO logistic regression models were built to identify independent predictors for undergoing a circuit change. Bivariate regression analysis was used to compare outcomes in patients undergoing a circuit change to those who did not. Primary outcome of interest was mortality on ECMO; secondary outcomes included major bleeding, neurologic, and infectious morbidities; p<0.05 was significant.\nResults\nOne hundred ninety-one patients were included; 144 (75%) had no circuit change, while 47 (25%) had one or more circuit change(s). Lower gestational age at birth (p=0.04), higher WBC (p=0.03), higher platelet transfusion during ECMO (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for undergoing a circuit change. Compared to those who did not undergo a circuit change, patients who did had longer median ECMO duration (p<0.001), higher rates of bleeding complications (p=0.02), and higher mortality (p=0.03).\nConclusion\nChanging the circuit while on ECMO support was associated with longer ECMO duration, higher mortality, and higher bleeding complications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOptimality of Re-triage of Under-triaged Severely Injured Patients in California Alona Furmanchuk, PhD, Kelsey Rydland, PhD, Abel Kho, MD, Anne M Stey, MD, MSc Northwestern University, Chicago, IL Northwestern, Chicago, IL INTRODUCTION: Re-triage is a complex process where nontrauma centers (NTC) transfer under-triaged severely injured patients to high-level trauma centers (TC). The process requires calling multiple high-level centers to accept the patient, coordinating transport and providing comprehensive hand-off. This study sought to quantify the optimality re-triage between NTC and TC in California.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted an observational cohort study utilizing 2016 California Office of Statewide Health and Planning Data of severely injured adults. Network analysis based on the ground transportation and air ambulance data was employed to estimate the total distance and time from NTC to TC for each transfer. The optimality of re-triages was estimated at Trauma System level (percent of transfers to closest high-level TC) and at center level (percent of NTCs that re-triages to closest high-level TC for 90% of transfers).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRESULTS:\nIn the CA Trauma System 81.2% of re-triages were to the closest high-level TC. However, at the individual center level, only four NTCs (1.8%) re-triaged 90% of transfers to the closest high-level TC. When there was <50 miles of driving distance between NTC and TC, 74% of 1,216 non-optimal ground transfers could have reduced transfer times between 1-61 minutes had they re-triaged to the closest high-level TC. When there was 50 miles, 99% of non-optimal transfers could have been reduced by 1-324 minutes by driving or flying to the nearest high-level TC. CONCLUSION: The CA trauma system had satisfactory optimality in 2016. Optimization of re-triage to closest TC could improve performance of CA trauma system.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOptimization of re-triage to closest TC could improve performance of CA trauma system.

[citation 11] proposed a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Target positioning based on particle centroid drift in large-scale WSNs \nAbstract: The localization problem of target nodes remains unresolved, especially in large-scale and complex environments. In this paper, we propose a particle centroid drift (PCD) algorithm to reduce the distance errors between nodes and obtain the particle aggregation region by using the drift vector. First, we use the particle quality prediction function to obtain the particles in a high-likelihood region. The high-quality particles have high probability in the calculation, which can increase the number of effective particles and enable avoiding particle degradation. Then, the centroid drift vector is used to make the particle distribution similar to the actual reference distribution. Experiments are conducted on state-space models: the local movement where 55% nodes are moving and the globe movement where 100% nodes are moving. The results show that the proposed algorithm has low estimation errors, a good tracking effect and an acceptable time complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nenvironment  [5] -  [7]  because a high node density and a large communication overhead are required. Typical examples of range-free algorithms include Amorphous  [8] , Distance Vector-Hop(DV-Hop)  [9] , Multi Dimentional Scaling Map(MDS-MAP)  [10] , Distance Vector-short(DV-short)  [11]  and Approximate Point in Triangulation Test(APTT)  [12] . Moreover, many scholars have proposed using the connectiveness between nodes to determine a target's current movement position and predict its next position. Bayesianestimation-based filtering algorithms such as the Particle Filter(PF)  [13] , Extended Kalman Filter(EKF)  [14] , Extended Kalman Particle Filter(EKPF)  [15] , Unscented Kalman Filter(UKF)  [16]  and Hybrid Iterated Kalman Particle Filter(HIKPF)  [17]  are representative of this scenario.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe drift theory was used to design a Monte Carlo procedure in a Markov chain, causing the particle samples to be similar to observations. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) proposed in  [12]  measures the distance between nodes, and the measurement error was contained in the observation function of the motion noise. As a result, the positions of objects were determined by a weighted aggregation and by maximizing the PSO. Hou et al.  [27]  proposed an improved cubature PF algorithm that uses the least squares to estimate the prior states of target nodes. The cubature Kalman filter and Gauss-Newton iterative methods were used to measure the posterior state. This work provided the suggested distribution for the PF and improved the positioning accuracy. V\u00e1zquez and M\u00edguez  [28]  introduced a distributed PF algorithm based on the posterior probability and combined it with Bayesian estimation. Experimentally, this method is superior to the distributed PF in terms of the positioning accuracy and robustness. In summary, most existing works combined the range-based and range-free methods and used additional auxiliary filters to improve the positioning accuracy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, they did not consider the particle degradation problem and ignored the influence of various intricate environmental factors (such as the number of deployed nodes, the mobility, and the path loss factor) and PF parameters (such as the number of generated particles, the noise variation and the particle population mobility) on the positioning accuracy of the target node. In addition, they were limited by their computational complexity and convergence speed, hindering them from being applicable in a large-scale and complex environment.\n\nIII. PROPOSED ALGORITHM\nThe target node periodically broadcasts beacon packets to neighboring nodes, and each beacon packet contains its identification number and location coordinates. When the number of beacon packets exceeds a specified threshold, the node is determined to be the centroid of a polygon. Correspondingly, the centroids of its neighboring nodes are viewed as its estimation. Although the traditional PF algorithm can perform node position estimation in non-linear and non-Gaussian WSNs, it has the particle degradation problem which means particles in the higher likelihood region have bigger weights and particles that do not intersect with the prior distribution region have weights close to 0. This problem can be well addressed by predicting the posterior distribution of high-quality particle populations. PQP algorithm can be applied in this respect.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Melanoma care and survival can be improved by early diagnosis, which can be facilitated by the use of noninvasive imaging modalities. Here we review 5 modalities available in clinical practice. Total body photography is used to follow patients at high risk for melanoma by detecting new lesions or subtle changes in existing lesions. Dermoscopy is an effective noninvasive technique for the early recognition of melanoma by allowing clinicians to visualize subsurface structures. Computer-assisted diagnostic devices are fully automated analysis systems with the capacity to classify lesions as benign or malignant with limited involvement from clinicians. Confocal scanning laser microscopy is an in vivo and noninvasive technology that examines the skin at a resolution comparable to that of histology. High-resolution ultrasound is an adjunct diagnostic aid mainly for the early detection of lymph node metastasis. Applications and limitations of each technology are discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs with many novel technologies, the high cost and bulky design of current CSLM devices are considered to be major barriers. Efforts, such as miniaturizing the device and lowering the cost of production can facilitate wider adoption. In addition, extensive training in both the acquisition and the interpretation of CSLM images is needed. Like dermoscopy, there is a steep learning curve to master the interpretation of CSLM images. Lastly, the technology has intrinsic limitations where CSLM evaluation can give rise to false-positive or falsenegative results.  64, 78, 79  \n\nHigh-Resolution Ultrasound\nMedical ultrasonography is an ultrasound-based diagnostic imaging modality used to visualize body tissue in real time. Modern ultrasound devices are both portable and relatively inexpensive when compared with other imaging modalities. The ultrasound technology is based on pulse-echo systems in which acoustic pulses are generated by a transducer and propagated to the body tissue. The return waves (echo) from the tissue are detected and converted into images for visual inspection. The resolution of the image and depth of tissue penetration is largely dependent on the frequency of the ultrasound transducer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDespite its clinical efficacy, dermoscopy has several shortcomings. As mentioned previously, extensive training in the interpretation and analysis of dermoscopic structures and patterns is needed. A steep learning curve often discourages many clinicians from routinely using the device in daily practice. Also, some subset of melanomas (MMs), such as amelanotic/hypomelanotic MMs that lack pigmentations and dermoscopic structures, are exceedingly difficult to diagnose with dermoscopy. Moreover, its role in detecting MMs \u03fd 6 mm remains in debate.  38, 39  Nevertheless, for these difficult  lesions, clinicians can perform short-term mole monitoring by taking dermoscopic photos of the concerning lesions.  30, 40  Computer-Assisted Diagnostic Systems The combination of TBP and dermoscopy has improved diagnostic accuracy, but there are still significant numbers of pigmented lesions that pose a diagnostic challenge. To further improve diagnostic accuracy, various research groups in the world have been engaged in developing equipment and analytical software that can provide objective evaluations and even diagnoses of pigmented skin lesions, especially melanoma.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn general, the dermoscopic image qualities from PD and NPD are relatively similar. The major difference is that surface dermoscopic structures (eg, comedone-like openings, milia-like cysts and blue white veil) are better observed with NPD. In contrast, deep structures (eg, vessels) are better seen with PD.  29  The clinical utility of dermoscopy in aiding the diagnosis of melanoma is well documented. A list of these benefits are described in Table  1 .  30  Among these benefits, increased diagnostic accuracy is the most important feature. In the hands of experienced users, dermoscopy increases the diagnostic accuracy by more than 40%.  31  This improvement has been verified by several meta-analyses.  23, 32, 33  For patients, the improvement in diagnostic accuracy directly translates into an improvement of the benign/malignant biopsy ratio.  34  Terushkin et al  35  have shown that a group of clinicians performed fewer biopsies as their dermoscopic acumen increased. Increasing diagnostic confidence is another valuable benefit that appeals to practitioners.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To this end, according to WSN\u2019s characteristics and based on the identity-based encryption idea, an improved identity-based encryption algorithm (IIBE) is proposed, which can effectively simplify the key generation process, reduce the network traffic, and improve the network security. The design idea of this algorithm lies between the traditional public key encryption and identity-based public tweezers\u2019 encryption. Compared with the traditional public key encryption, the algorithm does not need a public key certificate and avoids the management of the certificate. Compared with identity-based public key encryption, the algorithm addresses the key escrow and key revocation problems. The results of the actual network distribution experiments demonstrate that IIBE has low energy consumption and high security, which are suitable for application in WSN with high requirements on security. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \ne parameter design of IIBE encryption algorithm is shown in Table  1  It can be seen from Table  2  that the key security of the proposed IIBE algorithm is the highest. en, compare the computational complexity of different algorithms, as shown in Table  3 .

Health information from traditional, online and social media may influence vaccine hesitancy. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of exposure to COVID-19 information from various media on vaccine hesitancy, as well as the mediating roles of public trust in government and vaccine confidence. With a sample of 438 online participants (mean age = 30.69 years) responding to an anonymous questionnaire, the study tested a mediation model using bias-corrected bootstrap. The results indicated that exposure to COVID-19 information from online news media and traditional media can reduce vaccine hesitancy indirectly. Whereas a positive and indirect relationship between COVID-19 information exposure on social media and vaccine hesitancy was revealed. Trust in government and vaccine confidence were found to be salient mediators between exposure to COVID-19 information from various media and vaccine hesitancy. Findings from this study offer implications for strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSeveral limitations of this study should be noted. First, single-item measures were used to investigate participants' COVID-19 information exposure on traditional news media, online news media, and social media, and this might incur measurement errors. Future research should use multiple items to ensure adequate reliability (e.g. internal consistency). Second, the cross-sectional study design might preclude an assessment of causality between COVID-19 information exposure, trust in government, vaccine confidence, and vaccine hesitancy. Scholars can use longitudinal research designs or experimental methods to better understand the relationships. Third, the data of this study was collected through an online survey which might be influenced by sampling bias, and the results cannot be generalized. For instance, the survey was available to respondents who are active online, and the sample of this study is skewed toward a highly educated population. Scholars should use probability sampling methods to research a diverse population and obtain higher-quality findings.\n\nConclusion\nDuring the crisis of COVID-19 pandemic, mass media play a salient role that potentially influences people's decision-making processes regarding the COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide, posing a dangerous threat to public health. By November 2021, there were about 250 million confirmed cases worldwide and well over 5 million deaths. In the past year, nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cancelling mass gathering activities, travel restrictions, and mandating social distancing) were implemented by countries to reduce the transmission of COVID-19  (Dinleyici et al., 2020; Liu, 2021 Liu, , 2020)) . In the meanwhile, health experts recognize COVID-19 vaccination as one of the most important measures for combating COVID-19 infection  (Dinleyici et al., 2020) . Recently, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has begun in many countries, such as the United States, Russia, and China  (Smith et al., 2020) . However, an alarming number of people are highly suspicious of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and refuse immunization, a behavior defined as vaccine hesitancy  (Featherstone et al., 2019; Getman et al., 2018) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe statistically acknowledged (p<.05) indirect path and unacknowledged (aka non-significant) direct path form indirect-only mediation  (Zhao et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2021) . One plausible reason is that social media contain a fair amount of misinformation that was closely related to public health  (Bode & Vraga, 2018; Chou et al., 2018) . Given that COVID-19 vaccine development was compressed in time, and news about temporary side effects of the vaccines has been reported and raised global concerns, it is worrying that misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors about COVID-19 and vaccines against the disease were spread widely on the internet  (Duffy, 2020; Liu & Huang, 2020) . Individuals who relied on social media for COVID-19 related information were more likely to be misinformed by disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines  (Burki, 2020; Wilson & Wiysonge, 2020) . The spread of disinformation and misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media can weaken people's confidence in vaccine safety and increase vaccine hesitancy.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Safe fatigue lives of the NE, SiC, and Al2O3-SAJs were estimated at different reliability levels. The experimental measurements revelated that reducing the adhesive layer thickness from 0.25 mm to 0.17 mm result in enhancing the tensile strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs by 9.6% and 4.4%, respectively, in return of 9.5% and 5.4% for the Al2O3-SAJ relative to the NE-SAJ. The strength and stiffness of the SiC-SAJs with 0.17 mm bond thickness are higher than those of the Al2O3-SAJ by 15.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The highest improvement of 22.0% in the fatigue strength was occurred for the SiC-SAJ with bond thickness of 0.17 mm in return of 4.8% for the Al2O3-SAJ. The Up was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints practically the change in the enclosed area of the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large variation in the tan \u03b4, E'', and Ud. Damping factor of the NE-SAJs is marginally increased with the stress levels compared to the aggravated increase of both SiC and Al2O3-SAJs. Zhang model predicts well the potential energy and storage modulus specially at higher stress levels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn general, the S-N curves can be used for prediction the joint life, but they do not give indication about the damage initiation, propagation, and the dynamic parameters during the lifetime of the joint that will be investigated in the following sections. Statistical analysis. Table  5  shows the computed Weibull parameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2), Mean lives (N m ) and coefficient of variation (CV%). The Weibull parameters were used to draw the Weibull fatigue life distributions of the SiC-SAJs at different stress levels, as shown by the representative example in Figure  8 . It is obvious from Figure  8  that the lowest slopes (i.e., higher scatter) were observed at the intermediate stress levels (66.7 MPa and 70.7 MPa) compared to those of the minimum (55.5 MPa) and maximum (75.0 MPa) stress levels. These observations are consistent with the estimated CV% in Table  5 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAccordingly, the U p can be considered a powerful tool for monitoring and detecting the damage in the adhesive joints in which the variation in the area enclosed by the hysteresis cycle is too small to cause a large change in the U d , E'' and tan \u03b4. On the other hand, the predicted normalized potential energy of both NE and SiC-SAs show relatively less agreement with the experimental results, as shown in Figure  20 (b). Again, this behavior was attributed to the insignificant loss in the joint stiffness during stage II (main portion of joint life) that contrary to Zhang sigmoid model assumption. Hence, many efforts are required to develop analytical models that capable to monitoring and predicting the variation in the stiffness degradation as well as the increasing rate in the potential energy under low or moderate fatigue loading and thus, help in preventing the catastrophic failure of the joint without warning.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, fatigue results of the scarf adhesive joints (SAJs) fabricated using neat epoxy (NE), and SiC and Al 2 O 3 -nanocomposite adhesives were extensively analyzed regarding the effect of the adhesive materials, bond thickness (0.17 mm and 0.25 mm) on fatigue lives and dynamic behavior.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe scatter in the fatigue life was investigated using the two parameter Weibull function. Safe fatigue lives of the NE, SiC, and Al 2 O 3 -SAJs were estimated at different reliability levels. The following conclusions are drawn from this study. The measured potential energy (area under loading curve) was increased with the increase of the stress level (\u03c3 max ) as consequence of increasing the thermal and mechanical interfacial damages in the SAJs. This result is consistent with decreasing the storage modulus (E'), which has a linear inverse relationship with Potential energy (U p ). Potential energy (U p ) was used for the first time (except author works) for monitoring and predicting the damage in the adhesive joints in which the variation in the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop is too small to cause a large change in the factor (tan \u03b4), loss modulus (E''), and dissipated energy (U d ). Zhang model predicts well the experimental measurements of the potential energy and storage modulus (E 0 ) specially at higher stress levels (i.e., high damage) at which they follow a sigmoid curve with constant increasing/ decreasing rates during the most lifetime of the joint.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The study found that the research on ceramic textilesis currently in the extension stage, the papers published by Chinese scholars rank first in the world, but the importance is low.\nThe research has gone through three stages, research hotspots include ceramic textile composite performance, preparationtechnology, heat preservation, composite material preparation, and application, etc, \u201cmicrostructure\u201d, \u201crefinement\u201d and\u2018temperature\u2019 are research hotspots in this field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the table, China's intermediary centrality is lower than that of the United Kingdom and even France, which ranks sixth in publications, the analysis believes that academic exchange activities are mainly caused by the country's geographic location, lower than the academic exchanges between European and American countries  [17] .\n\nDistribution of institutions\nThrough the analysis of the distribution of research institutions, in addition to getting rid of the overall situation of the country, we can explore the current key research institutions in this field, this is the focus of academic research in this field, it is also convenient for researchers to understand the distribution of research forces in this field.

The country with the earliest documents included in the WoS core database is the United Kingdom, and its total documents are second only to China, ranking second  [16] . In addition, the centrality in Cite space can reflect the intermediary status of academic research. Centrality is a measure of how connected a particular node is in the entire network, it refers to a certain point in the network, and the ratio of the shortest path connecting these two points to the total number of shortest path lines between these two points, nodes with high centrality are usually the main nodes in the entire network and are used to connect different research topics.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nResearch methods and tools\nThe research uses information science from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, and the information visualization software CiteSpace developed by the Java language developed by Professor Chen Chaomei of the School of Technology in 2004, one of the theoretical sources of the software is Kuhn's scientific development paradigm theory, it is believed that scientific development can be extracted from published literature through its footprint, through combing through a large amount of literature, using its own algorithm to detect the development history and hot areas of a certain discipline or field, mainly through visualization functions such as keyword analysis, emergence analysis, co-citation analysis, and knowledge node analysis, etc, demonstrate and analyze the evolution trend and knowledge connection status of the frontier of the discipline.

Blockchain technology as a secure and low-cost platform to track the billions of eventual transactions in a distributed energy economy has attracted the attention of experts in various fields of science. The current form of centralized energy trading system is still suffering from security concerns, quality of service, and to name a few. A decentralized energy system using blockchain technology allows the parties to create a trading energy transaction via microgrid. The blockchain technology offers the promise of an immutable, single source of truth from multiple sources without a third-party involvement. In this paper, we describe, explore and analyze the prominent implementation of blockchain technology in the energy sector. Furthermore, we analyze the security issues and highlight the performance of several attacks that might be occurred in the proposed system. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis is the minimum necessary to maintain a balanced load  [24] . Fig.  3  shows a possible three-layered software structure for a cooperative mirror system. The highest layer would provide an interface to users, including naming.  From the client's side, there is a block, such as a file system, block store, and the chord itself. Block stores and chords are connected to another server and the client from the server. The primary usage of the chord protocol is a query value  [21]  from a client to find a successor (k). This refers to an O(N) query time, and the N refers to the number of rings applied. As shown in Fig 4 ., each node has a successor and a predecessor. The successor to a node is the next node in the identifier circle in a clockwise direction. The predecessor is counter-clockwise. However, typically, there are \"holes\" in the sequence (because of failure or departure).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe authors did not elaborate on the attacker's performance, such as selfish mining, eclipse attack, and double spending attack in the model. Imbault et al.  [9]  proposed the green blockchain concept for managing energy and exploring and creating a green certificate in an eco-district. There are no details \n\n45\nrelated to the security issues in this system. Recently, Danzi et al.  [10]  showed the concept of distributed proportional fairness control via a blockchain smart contract. The study aimed to enhance efficiency, especially regarding transmission losses in the smart grid.\n\nII. RESEARCH METHOD A. FUNDAMENTAL OF BLOCKCHAIN\nThe blockchain network can be described as a data structure used to create ledgers containing much transaction information  [11] -  [13] . As it has for centuries, commerce relies on trust and verified identity with cryptography protocol modules embedded in the system to ensure the credibility of the data and other security manners. As shown in Fig  2 , the timestamp is used in digital documents to prevent the attacker from tamperproofing it. The block in the blockchain is like a seal; if the attacker tries to break the seal, everyone is allowed to know the action.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, typically, there are \"holes\" in the sequence (because of failure or departure). Regarding the possibility of the holes, each node records an arc of 2\ud835\udc5f + 1 nodes in the middle of which it stands, i.e., the list of \ud835\udc5f nodes preceding it and \ud835\udc5f nodes following it. This list results in a high probability that a node can correctly locate its successor or predecessor, even if the network suffers from a high failure rate  [21] . In our system model, the chord-based distributed system is used to know the node location among the neighbors in the decentralized trading system.\n\nIII. RESULT AND DISCUSSION A. DECENTRALIZED ENERGY TRADING MODEL\nA prominent example of a blockchain trading energy system is the Brooklyn microgrid  [24]  as shown in Figure  5 , designed in the USA. It can be described as a solution that combines the security and transparency between the neighbors offered by the blockchain concept. The system aims to measure the ability of blockchain technology to buy and sell energy among the neighbors and how effective blockchain technology is adopted.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

With the widespread availability of internet technology, the frequency of intelligent cyber-attacks in virtual cyber environments, such as APT attacks, continues to rise. Through an intelligent analysis of cyber threats which are still unknown, it is possible to prevent security accidents before they occur through the use of intelligent security analysis methods based on big data. The researcher conducted this empirical study concerning intelligent security analysis methods utilizing big data which are capable of preventing cyber threats, while protecting information assets from risks through evaluation and prediction. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition, such conventional technologies use integrated security management methods that manage the logs of security products on different models. In particular, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and anti-virus technologies are focused on the development of the platform technology needed to apply signature or blacklist-based detection methods to 10Gbp-level high-performance networks. Also, the changes in the key technologies to counter cyber-attacks were based on integrated security management technologies, and it is expected that an intelligent security analysis model using big data will be the prominent topic of the future. By seamlessly integrating security equipment that has previously been operated separately and managing them as a whole, it will be possible to conduct an intelligent analysis of security threats, which will allow us to predict future problems in parallel with behavior-based analysis, to prevent and remove security risks. Big data security analysis methods will allow the threats of attacks that have not been resolved to be addressed, utilizing the security system that will ensure seamless responses to the latest cyber-attacks. The correlation analysis of big data through these security systems will reveal the unknown patterns of the attacks and support decision-making. By implementing a high-performance pattern matching algorithm through the behavior-based signature database, it would be possible to make comparisons at a higher speed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn Chapter 2 of this article, the author conducted a literature review that describes the evolution of cyber-attack technologies, which is followed by Chapter 3 in which the intelligent security analysis method utilizing big data is presented. In Chapter 4, the author explains the intelligent behavioral analysis and verification methods. Finally, Chapter 5 provides the conclusion and suggestions for future research.\n\nLiterature review\n1. The Evolution of Cyber-Attacks With the evolution of the technologies used in cyber-attacks, they are now considered one of the major threats against the country and society. One of the most commonly used types of cyber-attack is the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack. An APT attack continuously attacks its target with the goal of stealing industrial secrets, classified military intel, and customer information, etc. In addition, as this attack is used for major information  http://www.webology.org  leakage, control system attacks, and cyber terrorism, the threat of cyber-targeted attacks targeting major information and communication infrastructure is increasing.\n\nExcerpt 3: \ndetection analysis is the main technology\n\nData & User Monitoring\nMonitoring data/user activity, including user and data context, is an essential skill for intrusion detection and misuse detection, and is fundamentally required for monitoring privileged users and sensitive data access\n\nApplication monitoring\nSince application vulnerabilities are the main target of targeted attacks, the activity monitoring technology of abnormal applications\n\nAnalytics\nA core technology for big data security analysis that analyzes the characteristics of various source information and determines whether there is an abnormality using machine learning, data mining, and network mining techniques, which are traditional methods of big data analysis\n\nBehavior-Based Intelligent Security Analysis Methods and Verification Results\nIn this study, security threats are classified by reconstructing the records of persistent attacks recorded in security solutions, servers, applications, and other events to enable a response to cyber-attacks in real time. That is, the researcher intends to study a behaviorbased intelligent security analysis method in which detection rules can be used to understand the relationships of the events before and after an attack. This behavior-based technology will allow attacks to be predicted before they happen, making it possible to make an immediate decision.\n\nBehavior-based Intelligent Security Analysis\nAn attacker uses various cyber-attack tools to get the information he or she wants.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consider the first computing problem utilizing a minimum solution matrix. A convex infinite set is generated by a restricted number of closed intervals. Second, computing is an objective-domain nonlinear mathematical optimization problem. A multi-objective optimization problem is used to solve the second programming challenge. The constraint set must be used. Use discrete optimization techniques and branch-and-bound procedures for \u201cdigital integer linear programming\u201d. Our technique has been shown to be both practical and successful. The programming complexity increases as the organization expands. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA systems analyst must keep in mind that excessive energy output could harm the human body. Even still, Theorem 4 in Section 3) shows that there are no unique optimal solutions to Problem (3). X 1 (A, b) is an infinite set of optimum solution to Problem (3), sometimes known as X 1 (A, b). As a result, we use an unlimited set of X 1 (A, b) values to look for the most ideal solution, which employs a second optimization objective  (Shang et al., 2014) . In the above definition, optimizing the second objective given X 1 (A, b). Constraint reuse is a secondlevel issue. To increase non-operational base stations, we must reduce operational base stations. When base stations fail, their maintenance costs fall. The second goal is to reduce base station operating costs. While a non-functional base station has no electro-magnetic strength, a functional base station does. For instance, in order to keep the zero norm of the vector x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 . . .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAim 1 in Problems (3)-(  4 ) is to keep electromagnetic waves intensity as low as possible, whereas objective 2 is to keep base station operating expenses as low as possible. Problem (3) can be solved using the idea of a minimal solution matrix presented by Yang et al. While Yang's method fails to provide the whole solution set to the problem, this paper will prove that (3). We could not employ Yang's methods in the original study since it did not address the bi-level problem. This study seeks to discover the best possible solution to the problem stated above, which is bi-level objective programming (3), (4). The final section of Section 3 looks at the ideal solution set for Problem (3) and measures its quality by utilizing a minimum-maximum norm solution matrix. This chapter studies the problem at the second level (4). We use the set of minimum-norm solutions to solve the problem (4). We have included a mathematical example in Section 5 to show how and why our proposed method might be implemented and would produce accurate results. Section 4 discusses several forms of management requirements in order to highlight multiple kinds of bi-level difficulties.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAdditionally, system administrators may have additional requirements that must be taken into consideration when single-level optimization is employed.

Most of them usually assume homogeneous parameters with a specific Gaussian distribution for each domain, ignoring the robust testing of data skewness. This paper proposes to use unsupervised ensemble autoencoders connected to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to adapt to multiple domains regardless of the skewness of each domain. In the hidden space of the ensemble autoencoder, the attention-based latent representation and reconstructed features of the minimum error are utilized. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the sample density in the GMM. When the estimated sample density exceeds the learning threshold obtained in the training phase, the sample is identified as an outlier related to an attack anomaly. Finally, the ensemble autoencoder and the GMM are jointly optimized, which transforms the optimization of objective function into a Lagrangian dual problem. Experiments conducted on three public data sets validate that the performance of the proposed model is significantly competitive with the selected anomaly detection baselines. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThey obtained domain-related models with adjustable budgets in terms of the number of parameters and computational complexity. To adjust the computational complexity of the network, they adopted a pretrained architecture to derive a specialized deep model for each domain and then incorporated a budget-aware adapter to select the most relevant feature channel to better process the data from the new domain. Among recent works, there are also some studies that improve domain adaptability through adversarial learning. They decompose a deep network into feature extractor and classifier components and then train each component by tuning its partner  (Xu, Chen, Zuo, Yan, & Lin, 2018) . They either use a deep cocktail network (DCTN) to deploy multidirectional adversarial learning to minimize the difference between the targets and multidomain data  (Ganin et al., 2016)  or use domain-specific representation learning  (Schoenauer-Sebag et al., 2019) , where the data come from similar but heterogeneous distributions.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAlthough multidomain machine learning solves the problem of domain adaptability to some extent through assumptions about specific data distributions, the performance of most models is poor in practice because they ignore the nature of data skewness and lack a process that effectively determines the robustness of multidomain data. It is claimed that ignoring the inconsistency of the data size and the heterogeneity of the data distribution generated by network traffic will have a serious impact on the detection results and may even mislead the entire machine learning process. In contrast to existing works, the current study focuses on extracting the hidden relationship between data that are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and unbalanced data and performing robust optimization on data from different domains so that the proposed scheme can further improve domain adaptability without relying on assumptions about the data distribution.\n\nProposed framework\n\n\nSystem overview\nThe purpose of this research is to perform effective anomaly detection on network intrusion samples from different domains. The key problem to be solved is the feature learning and reconstruction of high-dimensional multidomain data. However, most of the current studies using single-channel networks cannot capture the hidden spatial information of data in different domains, and the features of the reconstructed errors do not include the differential representation of heterogeneous distributions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, the obvious disadvantage is that the joint optimization of dimensionality reduction and density estimation is usually computationally difficult under a generic framework  (Andresini et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020) , and the performance of the model is mainly affected by two limitations. The first is that they cannot handle the heterogeneity of data from different domains and cannot capture the subtle differences in different data distributions. The second is that they cannot obtain the variable information of samples in a low-dimensional space but simply estimate the sample density, which restricts the complex training process of multidomain data  (Injadat, Moubayed, Nassif and Shami, 2020) . Although deep autoencoders achieve good performance in single-domain tasks, in many practical situations, a unified model for multidomain data is required for shared tasks. Therefore, multidomain machine learning technology is used to obtain cross-domain adaptability and inherit the advantages of multitask learning at the same time  (Hu et al., 2020) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n\nResults: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nspecificity (Sp), precision, accuracy (Acc) and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC): Sn \u00bc TP TP \u00fe FN Sp \u00bc TN TN \u00fe FP Precision \u00bc TP TP \u00fe FP Acc \u00bc TP \u00fe TN TP \u00fe TN \u00fe FP \u00fe FN MCC \u00bc TP \u00c2 TN \u00c0 FP \u00c2 FN ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u00f0TP \u00fe FP\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TP \u00fe FN\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TN \u00fe FP\u00de \u00c2 \u00f0TN \u00fe FN\u00de p where TP, TN, FP and FN denote the numbers of true positives (correctly predicted cleavage sites), true negatives (correctly predicted 3 Results and discussion On the other hand, if the target dataset is large or the number of parameters is small,\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe provide a detailed description of how these data were encoded into the inputs for the DeepCleave's network in Supplementary Methods section in Supplementary Materials. We compare the predictive quality of these approaches on the training and independent test datasets in Supplementary Tables  S7  and S8 , respectively. Results reveal that majority of these input types, except for the putative secondary structure, can be used to predict the cleavage sites reasonably well. The average AUCs computed over the 12 proteases equal 0.605 for the putative secondary structure, 0.766 for CKSAAP, 0.798 for the putative solvent accessibility, 0.806 for the PSSM and conservation scores, 0.922 when using the BLOSUM62 matrix-derived inputs and 0.947 when using the one-hot encoding from DeepCleave. Similar trend is true when using the average MCC, with the corresponding values equal 0.181, 0.463, 0.527, 0.510, 0.732 and 0.828.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe summarize these results in Supplementary Tables  S4  and S5 . The results reveal that the DeepCleave models trained with transfer learning achieves a significantly better performance than the models trained without transfer learning for all 12 proteases. The average AUC of DeepCleave trained with transfer learning over the 12 proteases is 0.92, while the models trained without transfer learning achieve an average AUC of 0.75. In addition, DeepCleave trained with transfer learning also achieves a significantly better accuracy (0.89 versus 0.76), MCC (0.77 versus 0.52), sensitivity (0.88 versus 0.79) and precision (0.89 versus 0.76) than the models trained without the transfer learning. Taken together, these results indicate that the transfer learning strategy is effective for training accurate DeepCleave models using limited protease-specific cleavage data.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

For each patient cohort, a decision analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions over a 5-year horizon. A Markov process was embedded in the decision model to simulate the possible prognosis of cancer. Data on transition probabilities, survival, side-effects, quality of life and costs were obtained from published sources and the SABR Commissioning through Evaluation (CtE) scheme. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with respect to quality-adjusted life-years. The robustness of the results was examined in a sensitivity analysis. Analyses were conducted from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective.\nResults\nIn the base case analysis, which assumed that all three interventions were associated with the same cancer progression rates and mortality rates, SABR was the most cost-effective intervention for both patient cohorts. This conclusion was sensitive to the cancer progression rate, mortality rate and cost of interventions. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probability that SABR is cost-effective was 57% and 50% in liver oligometastases and HCC, respectively.\nConclusions\nOur results indicate a potential for SABR to be cost-effective for patients with liver oligometastases and HCC. This finding supports further investigation in clinical trials directly comparing SABR with surgery and radiofrequency ablation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFootnotes: * Within each analysis, the intervention in bold is the intervention which is considered to be most cost-effective under the NICE \u00a320,000 per QALY decision rule. \u2020 Assuming different cancer progression rate for patients receiving different interventions. The cancer progression rates for patients who received surgery were calibrated from published literature (Table  1 ). The cancer progression rate for patients who receiving SABR was obtained from CtE scheme: no progression to local recurrence (Weibull distribution, \u03b7=1.000, \u03b2=1.4928), no progression to regional/distant recurrence (exponential distribution monthly transition rate=3.99%). The cancer progression rate for patients receiving RFA was assumed to be the same as SABR due to lack of data. \u2021 Assuming different mortality rates for patients receiving different interventions. The monthly mortality rate for patients receiving surgery was obtained from published literature (0.87% per month)  [27] . The monthly mortality rate for patients receiving RFA was calculated based on a recent published meta-analysis: mortality relative risk (RFA vs surgery): 1.361  [59] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPatients accrued QALYs in each health state as the product of the quality of life tariff attached to the health state and the time spent in that health state. Each model was fully probabilistic; a distribution reflecting underlying uncertainty was specified for each parameter and a value for each parameter sampled from the respective distribution prior to evaluating each model. Mean costs and mean QALYs for each treatment strategy are reported after 5,000 simulations for each model. Details on the probabilistic analysis and the specification of distributions for each interval are provided in Appendix C. Cost-effectiveness is reported as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC)  [7] . The ICER is the ratio of the additional cost divided by the additional effectiveness of a treatment strategy compared to the next most effective strategy. Where one strategy is more effective and less costly than a comparator, the comparator is dominated. Where three strategies are compared, the strategy ranked in the middle for effectiveness may be less effective and more costly than some combination of the most and the least effective strategy. Such a strategy is extendedly dominated.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn structural sensitivity analysis we assumed that different treatment modality is associated with different mortality and/or different cancer progression rates.

Material and Methods The retrospective study comprised 127 pregnant women with various pregnancy complications between 23 and 39 gestational weeks. Umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms were recorded with Doppler ultrasound and characterized by pulsatility index (PI) and blood flow class (BFC). Doppler audio signals were stored on a digital video recorder and the sound frequency at the energy level 15 dB below its peak (MAXpeak-15 dB) was estimated off-line. The prediction of probability for composite adverse pregnancy outcome (operative delivery for fetal distress, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death) was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Results With increasing umbilical artery BFC, the MAXpeak-15 dB frequencies decreased (p < 0.0001) and the PI increased (p < 0.0001). The ROC AUCs for adverse outcome for MAXpeak-15 dB and for PI were 0.842 and 0.836 (p = 0.88), respectively. For the combination of MAXpeak-15 dB and PI, the corresponding AUC was 0.894, significantly higher than that of PI (p < 0.03) and of MAXpeak-15 dB (p < 0.05). Conclusion Umbilical artery Doppler sound spectrum analysis might be a useful supplement to PI in the clinical evaluation of fetoplacental circulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUse of stereo earphones also allows differentiation between positive and negative (reverse) signals by ear. After the advent of modern ultrasound techniques combining high-resolution imaging, color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler, listening to the signals has been generally abandoned in favor of adjusting the recording situation and optimizing signals by visual control of the Doppler spectrum. Indeed, modern ultrasound systems do not provide an output for audible signals anymore and the quality of built-in loudspeakers is usually very poor.   The evaluation of Doppler sound signals by ear is very subjective, highly dependent on the skills and experience of the operator. Consequently, the subjective method is not suitable for more general application. Therefore, we have developed an objective method of analyzing Doppler audio signals and we have identified a new parameter characterizing the sound signalthe maximum frequency at the energy level that is 15 dB below the peak (MAX peak-15 dB ). This new characteristic of the sound signal proved to correlate very well with the subjective classification by operator, both for computer-simulated sound frequencies  [22]  and for umbilical artery signals recorded from sheep fetuses under various degrees of experimental asphyxia  [9] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnalyses of the FFTs were done in the frequency range from 150 Hz, corresponding to the limit of earphones used by the sonographer, to 10,007 Hz, representing the frequency of the band stop of recording. An auditory feature, the high frequency cut-off band was identified within the frequency range  [14] . Based on the results of our previous experimental study  [9] , this high-frequency cut-off (MAX peak-15 dB ) was defined as the frequency band where the energy level had decreased by 15 dB from its maximum level, i. e. from the MAX peak value ( \u2022 \" Fig.  1 ). The primary outcome variable was the composite adverse pregnancy outcome including perinatal death, operative delivery for fetal distress and admission for treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit. The risk for a negative outcome, given a certain value for artery PI, auditory parameter MAX peak-15 dB, or combination of PI and MAX peak-15 dB , was calculated using logistic regression analysis.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSubsequently, in a human pilot study, we compared the audio analysis and the traditional waveform analysis of umbilical artery Doppler signals before and after maternal steroid treatment  [10] . The auditory parameter reflected the changes in the umbilical artery circulation more sensitively than the PI did. Our hypothesis is that the auditory analysis of umbilical artery Doppler sound spectrum might be an additional tool in the evaluation of fetal circulation in high-risk pregnancies. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively apply the new auditory parameter on a group of high-risk pregnancies with various degrees of placental insufficiency in order to investigate its possible usefulness.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n!\nThe study group comprised 127 singleton high-risk pregnancies with gestational age ranging from 23 to 39 weeks.

Its main function modules include SD (sales and distribution), MM (material management), PP (production planning), PM (factory maintenance), HR (human resources), and FICO (finance and cost) [citaton 7].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene product SAP regulates signals induced through the co-receptor SLAM \nAbstract: In addition to triggering the activation of B- or T-cell antigen receptors, the binding of a ligand to its receptor at the cell surface can sometimes determine the physiological outcome of interactions between antigen-presenting cells, T and B lymphocytes. The protein SLAM (also known as CDw150), which is present on the surface of B and T cells, forms such a receptor-ligand pair as it is a self-ligand. We now show that a T-cell-specific, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which contains an SH2 domain and a short tall, acts as an inhibitor by blocking recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to a docking site in the SLAM cytoplasmic region. The gene encoding SAP maps to the same area of the X chromosome as the locus for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and we found mutations in the SAP gene in three XLP patients. Absence of the inhibitor SAP in XLP patients affects T/B-cell interactions induced by SLAM, leading to an inability to control B-cell proliferation caused by Epstein-Barr virus infections. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n3a ). SAP was expressed in all major subsets of human T cells (CD4 + , CD45RO + , CD45RA + and CD8 + ) (Fig.  3c ), in the T-cell tumour cell line Jurkat, and in the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji which is positive in the Epstein\u00b1Barr virus (EBV). No transcripts were detected in the EBV + Burkitt lymphomas Namalwa or BL41/B95-8, the EBV-transformed cell line X50-7, the EBV + marmoset cell lines B95-8 and FF41, the EBV -Burkitt lymphoma BJAB, or in the pre-B ALL lines LAZ 221 and NALM 6 (Fig.  3 , and data not shown). Figure  2  Characterization of the human and murine SAP proteins and their interactions with SLAM. a, Jurkat cells and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were lysed and postnuclear lysates (1 mg ml -1 ) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with a rabbit antiserum directed against human SAP or with a control serum (3 ml).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCollectively, our results show that, unlike SLAM, SAP is primarily expressed in T cells. SAP is encoded by the XLP disease gene By using a 45-kb pBAC clone that contained all four exons of murine SAP (Fig.  1 ), the SAP gene was localized within band A5.1 of the murine X chromosome (C.W., J.S. and C.T., manuscript in preparation). Because of synteny between murine band A5.1 and human Xq25, where the locus for the immune de\u00aeciency X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) had been mapped 8\u00b111 , we investigated whether the SAP gene could be involved in this disease. Moreover, the observation that in XLP uncontrolled B-cell proliferation following EBV infection often leads to fatal infectious mononucleosis, malignant lymphomas, hypogammaglobulinaemia or aplastic anaemia  11, 12  was in agreement with the involvement of SLAM in T $ B-cell interactions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUsing a yeast two-hybrid system with the 77-amino-acid human SLAM cytoplasmic domain as bait and a human T-cell library, eight complementary DNA clones were isolated that encoded a 128-amino-acid polypeptide chain which we term SLAM-associated protein, or SAP. To con\u00aerm that the cDNAs were full-length, we also isolated cDNA clones from a human T-cell (Jurkat) library and from a murine (C57B16) thymus library. The predicted human SAP protein comprises a single SH2 domain (residues 6\u00b1102) followed by a short 26-aminoacid tail (residues 103\u00b1128). Human and murine SAP are highly homologous (96%) in both the SH2 and tail domains (Fig.  1 ). The SAP SH2 domain was clearly related to other SH2 domains, particularly those of SHIP (45%), EAT-2 (40%) and Abl (35%), but its short tail was unlike any known protein domain. Antibodies directed against human or mouse SAP-tail sequences detected a 15K protein in detergent lysates made from either human T cells (Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, the existing encryption methods cannot effectively solve the above problems when applied to WSN. To this end, according to WSN\u2019s characteristics and based on the identity-based encryption idea, an improved identity-based encryption algorithm (IIBE) is proposed, which can effectively simplify the key generation process, reduce the network traffic, and improve the network security. The design idea of this algorithm lies between the traditional public key encryption and identity-based public tweezers\u2019 encryption. Compared with the traditional public key encryption, the algorithm does not need a public key certificate and avoids the management of the certificate. Compared with identity-based public key encryption, the algorithm addresses the key escrow and key revocation problems. The results of the actual network distribution experiments demonstrate that IIBE has low energy consumption and high security, which are suitable for application in WSN with high requirements on security. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \ne parameter design of IIBE encryption algorithm is shown in Table  1  It can be seen from Table  2  that the key security of the proposed IIBE algorithm is the highest. en, compare the computational complexity of different algorithms, as shown in Table  3 . It can be seen from Table  3  that, compared with other algorithms, the computational complexity of the proposed IIBE algorithm in system initialization, helping device, and user key update is reduced from O (log N) to o (1), which means that the complexity of the proposed IIBE algorithm is the lowest.\n\nExperimental Results and Analysis\n4.1. Experimental Setup. In the experiment, the WSN node adopts CC2530 sensor network node of TI (Texas instruments) company  [30] , which has an enhanced C51 single chip microcomputer and 8k RAM storage space, and is powered by two No.5 batteries  [31, 32] . WSN nodes are shown in Figure  4 . e actual network topology of IIBE is shown in Figure  5 . Settings of WSN network parameters are shown in Table  4 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \ne calculation method of data reception rate  [33]  is as follows: Pr \ufffd \udbff\udf50 n i\ufffd0 n (i)receive \udbff\udf50 n i\ufffd0 n (i)send , ( 1 ) where n (i) receive represents the number of data received by the server from ith node and b represents the number of data sent by ith node. On CC2530 WSN node, the data receiving rates of several methods with 30-bit key are tested, and about 40,000 experimental data are obtained. e statistical fitting curve of the results is shown in Figure  7 . It can be seen from Figure  7  that when the network scale increases, the trend of traffic not only depends on the algorithm itself but also is greatly affected by the network layout.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNS2 simulation results show that this method is effective in preventing flooding attacks. However, this method only signs the data transmitted by nodes to prevent flooding attacks and has limited preventive effect on data eavesdropping attacks, so it needs to be combined with other encryption methods in practical applications. Rachkidy et al.  [23]  proposed a method of data storage combined with homomorphic encryption for some wireless sensor networks with insensitive real-time data, which is called DIOS. In some WSN (such as underwater sensor networks), people are more concerned about the whole data, rather than the data at a certain time. In view of this situation and considering that a large amount of data may cause loss to the sensor nodes if it is transmitted for a long time and a long distance, this literature puts forward that the data should be stored in a relay node in advance and preprocessed, so as to avoid the scattered and uninterrupted transmission of data. At the same time, homomorphic encryption is adopted to ensure security. is method is effective in some occasions, saving energy, and data can be stored safely. However, it is not suitable for most net-laying environments and has certain limitations.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

High-resolution radars (HRRs) utilize wideband signals and synthetic apertures to enhance the range and angular resolutions of tracking, respectively. They also generate one-, two-, and even threedimensional high-resolution images containing the feature information of targets, from which the targets can be precisely classified and identified. Advanced signal processing algorithms in HRRs obtain important information such as range-Doppler imaging, phase-derived ranging, and micro-motion features. However, the advantages and applications of HRRs are restricted by factors such as the reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-scatter point targets, decreased tracking accuracy of multi-scatter point targets, high demands of motion compensation, and low sensitivity of the target attitude. Focusing on these problems, this paper systematically introduces the novel technologies of HRRs and discusses the issues and solutions relevant to detection, tracking, imaging, and recognition. Finally, it reviews the latest progress and representative results of HRR-based research, and suggests the future development of HRRs. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA hierarchical recognition method handles different features by different classifiers. When designing classifiers at different levels, the classifier must be optimized by considering the physical meanings and statistical distributions of the features. For example, features such as target size and scattering center can be classified by a simple threshold discriminant classifier or a decision tree classifier, whereas the structural and statistical features of the scattering centers can be discriminated by a support vector machine classifier. Before making the final decision, the results of different classifiers can be combined by an ensemble classification method.  For adaptive feature extraction, we can exploit the end-to-end capability of deep neural networks. Deep learning avoids the high dependence of the traditional machine learning algorithm on human experience  [118] [119] [120] [121] . Deep neural networks include deep autoencoders, deep convolution neural networks, and deep recurrent neural networks. Among these, the deep convolution neural network is most commonly used. Figure  15  is a block diagram of HRRP recognition using a deep convolution neural network. The network includes a convolution layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSome outcomes of these studies are elaborated below. First, the classical point-target detector was modified for range-spread targets by the energy integration detector and the M out of N (M/N ) detector. The typical scattering density dependent generalized likelihood ratio test (SDD-GLRT) detector  [39] , which consists of a nonlinear map followed by an integrator along the range cells, detects a range-spread target among white Gaussian noise. If the scattering density parameter is known, the performance of SDD-GLRT improves. However, the efficiency of SDD-GLRT solutions is decreased by the exponential and logarithmic operations. The M/N detector is a typical double-threshold detector of spatially distributed targets. Owing to its efficient structure, this detector can be easily realized in engineering and has been widely applied. Therefore, it has attracted much interest and has been often modified to improve its robustness and efficiency  [40, 41, 55] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe network includes a convolution layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The stacked convolution layer and pooling layer map the original data directly to the high-level abstract features, which are then mapped to the target through the fully connected layer. The entire process requires no human intervention.\n\nApplications of HRR\n\n\nHigh-resolution monopulse precision-tracking test radar\nBased on theoretical research of HRR algorithms, the Beijing Institute of Technology has developed an X-band high-resolution monopulse precision-tracking test radar. The main parameters of the system are shown in Table  4 . In January 2016, the wideband test radar successfully realized full-bandwidth closed-loop tracking of civil aircraft in real time, and verified the key technologies of signal processing and data processing in wideband detection, tracking, high-precision measurement, imaging, and other procedures. As an important test platform, the wideband radar provides continuously measured data support for subsequent wideband detection and tracking research. Figure  16  is a photograph of the X-band wideband test radar. The X-band wideband radar records the echo data of an Airbus A320 airplane.

The high-quality image transmission in visual sensor networks (VSNs) consumes more space, energy, transmission delay which may experience the various security threats. Image compression is a key phase of visual sensing systems that needs to be effective. This motivates us to propose a fast and efficient intelligent image transmission module to achieve the energy-efficiency, minimum delay, and bandwidth utilization. Compressive sensing (CS) introduced to speedily compressed the image to reduces the consumption of energy, time minimization, and efficient bandwidth utilization. However, CS cannot achieve security against the different kinds of threats. Several methods introduced since the last decade to address the security challenges in the CS domain, but efficiency is a key requirement considering the intelligent manufacturing of VSNs. Furthermore, the random variables selected for the CS having the problem of recovering the image quality due to the accumulation of noise. Thus concerning the above challenges, this paper introduced a novel one-way image transmission module in multiple input multiple output that provides secure and energy-efficient with the CS model. The secured transmission in the CS domain proposed using the security matrix which is called a compressed secured matrix and perfect reconstruction with the random matrix measurement in the CS. Experimental results outwards that the intelligent module provides energy-efficient, secured transmission with low computational time as well as a reduced bit error rate. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nVisual sensing automation used vehicular networking with sensors. The emergence of 'sensor on wheels' in-car brings the additional features to driver-assisted systems integrated in present-day vehicle designs  (Manapragada and Kluesing 2014) . Welding is a thermal processing method; sensing using infra-red (IR) thermal image and camera are most extensively employed for monitoring and control of the welding process  (Chandrasekhar et al. 2015) .

The module determines a sub-set of the covariates (Eq. 4) to accomplish both of these objectives by driving the aggregate of the absolute estimation of the relapse coefficients to be a lower sum than a fixed worth that stimulates specific coefficients to be set to zero. By selecting these coefficients with prediction accuracy and interpreting the parameters, the random variables can be easily identified and reconstructed in the final stage.

To address these issues, compressed sensing emerges, which packs the image into hours of sensing, is generated in an expedient manner that reduces time usage and saves the use of data transfer capability, however Bomb in transmission. A variety of examinations cleared a way for dealing with security issues in compressive sensing (CS) through giving security as an alternative negotiation. In addition, univariate factors opted for CS as the issue of rearranging image quality is because of the aggregation of clutter. Along these lines related to the above issues, this paper proposed two-way image transmission to the Corvus Coron module, which presents an energy-effective with the CS model, as an inbuilt interaction in the CS transmission through the security framework.

The two-way transmission of image under a wireless channel needed image must compatible along channel characteristics such as band width, energy-efficient, time consumption and security because the image adopts big space under the device of storage and need a long time that easily undergoes cipher attacks. Moreover, Quizzical the problem for the additional time under compression results that, the secondary process of the compression followed through the acquisition consumes more time.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nHence, for resolving these issues, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged, which compressed the image at the time of sensing emerges as a speedy manner that reduces the time consumption and saves bandwidth utilization but fails under secured transmission. Several kinds of research paved path to resolve the security problems under CS through providing security such as the secondary process.\nFindings\nThus, concerning the above issues, this paper proposed the Corvus corone module two-way image transmission that provides energy efficiency along CS model, secured transmission through a matrix of security under CS such as inbuilt method, which was named as compressed secured matrix and faultless reconstruction along that of eminent random matrix counting under CS.\nOriginality/value\nExperimental outputs shows intelligent module gives energy efficient, secured transmission along lower computational timing also decreased bit error rate. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nDegree of compression, distortion size, when images are downloaded from the web  (Mahesh et al., 2016; Stolfo, 1997; Talukder and Harada, 2010) , are some of the aspects to note. Compression leads to deterioration of the image content, so pre-processing approaches such as optimization, segmentation and representation need to be Two-way image transmission performed to address these consistency-based issues  (Oh and Lei, 2012) . Once preprocessed, the image gets formatted through various techniques, resulting under digital form. These digital signals consume large space and more time when it moves through a wireless channel  (Yang et al., 2016) . The following Figure  1  shows the image transmission process through the channel. The prepared sign should be reformatted during image handling to get the first transmitted image, yet this sign will likewise give repetitive data  (Manapragada and Kluesing, 2014) .

In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe total number of offensive and defensive resources S A and S D are two key factors affecting the level of system vulnerability during the game phase.

In the game phase, in addition to the influencing factors of the network attack and defense, the dynamic convergence process of the distributed collaborative control itself will also affect the system vulnerability assessment results. The following is a description of the influence mechanism through the simulation example and then the sensitivity analysis.  The simulation analysis of the impact of network attack time and control scheduling commands on the vulnerability of distribution network CPS. The simulation results are shown in Fig.  10 , where the scheduling ratio is defined as the ratio of the reference power P ref to the maximum allowable output of the VPP, which shows that the VPP dynamically adjusts according to each control scheduling command, and the attack and defense game is performed at each moment.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn artificial intelligence and machine learning, the data and application scenarios are very important. If the application scenario can be abstracted into a model, the data can be used, and the correct algorithm can be combined, then the information trusted application will greatly improve the credibility of the network information, which has become one of the key issues in the development and application of the Internet. Whether artificial intelligence can be successfully applied to the field of credibility, including several measurable factors, such as adaptability, interpretability and the feasibility of algorithm training Enforceability  [6] -  [10] . The traditional physical systems (such as industrial control systems, drive systems, and medical devices) are relatively difficult to access, penetrate, and enforce attacks by the attackers because of their relatively isolated operating environment and the use of dedicated channels for communication. Due to the need of informatization and intelligence, the traditional physical systems have gradually evolved into CPS, and the operating environment of the system has been opened and interconnected through closure and isolation  [11] -  [13] . While improving operational efficiency, it also provides new attack channels for the attackers, making CPS more vulnerable to internal or external attacks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nRT is the expected value of the ultimate loss of the target, representing the risk; P is the probability of a target being attacked, \"threatening\"; V is the probability that a target will eventually be destroyed after being attacked, \"vulnerability\"; C is a target. The magnitude of the damage caused by the attack, and eventually being destroyed, represents the consequences. The cross-domain trustworthiness assessment method adopted in this article first establishes an information system network model N 1 = (V 1 ,\u03b1 1 ) and a power system network model N P = (V P , \u03b1 P ) based on the complex network theory. Among them, V 1 is a set of middle nodes in N 1 , where N 1 satisfies the idempotent rate, that is, the proportion of nodes whose degree is k in the network N 1 is P 1 (k).

The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach. The experimental results confirm the fact that the proposed model performs better than the existing machine learning models. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nLife without internet has almost become impossible in the present day and age. The potential of internet is enormous and its growth has been reflected in the functioning of business models pertaining to education, entertainment, healthcare and all the various types of organizations around the world. However, use of internet in every sphere of human life has its own challenges. The most significant challenge deals with data security. Network intrusion is a situation of security breach due to unauthorized access in a computational network. The process of identifying the different types of intrusions in a network is performed by an intrusion detection system (IDS)  [1] . The attacks in the IDS can be categorized as Probe attack, DoS attack, R2L attack, U2R attack. In probe attack, the unauthorized personnel 'sniffs' the network and identifies the vulnerabilities of a particular target resource. As an example, the attacker can use an uncommon port number as the identification with other IP addresses to attack on different ports. The DoS attacks are targeted to make the network resources unavailable by flooding unnecessary data packets by the attacker.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nApart from the popular machine learning techniques extreme learning machine (ELM) and NSL knowledge discovery data mining have been identified as a standard for the evaluation of intrusion detection mechanisms in the network  [7] . Researchers have also implemented random forest classifier on the IDS dataset sample. Such approaches have helped in the experimentation of datasets and analysing effects of malicious attacks considering various perspectives and dimensions  [8] . It is well known that applications of machine learning has a successful track record of automatically detecting and classifying intrusions both at network and host level in the quickest time frame. However, it is also essential to consider the volatility and ever changing characteristics of the malicious attacks involving larger volumes of stake holders. This issue needs to be resolved providing scalability. Moreover, the available datasets require continuous updates based on the dynamic characteristics of malware attacks. Several researchers have suggested the implementation of deep learning models and deep neural networks (DNN) for the development of flexible and dynamic IDS that would be capable of efficiently detecting and classifying capricious network attacks  [9] [10] [11] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe results of the DNN model reveal potential of high dimensional feature representation of the IDS data when fed into hidden layers in comparison to the other machine learning approaches. Based on the performance of the DNN model, the authors have proposed a scalable hybrid IDS-AlertNet system that would efficiently monitor network traffic and proactively send alert on cyber attacks. In coordination with the use of DNN, convolutional neural network algorithms have also been identified as an advanced and superior technology for extraction of features in an intrusion dataset for the classification purposes  [12] . There exists almost eleven datasets namely DARPA, KDD99, ISC2012 and ADFA13, which have been used for classification and analysis of intrusion datasets. However, most of these datasets fail to incorporate network traffic diversity, volume and versatility related information on malicious attacks. Moreover, there are cases of anonymous packet information, insufficient payload information, lack of features and metadata  [13] . The classical machine learning algorithms when applied to the biased public and biased datasets fail to yield accurate results making them impractical to be used in real-time situations. The authors hence have split the datasets in a disjoint fashion across multiple time scales for the purpose of training and testing of the ML model.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The stable growth of migrant children, which affects the sustainable stability of the community, is adversely impacted by sustained pressures without adequate assistance and advice. Therefore, psychological stress from each post on microblog has been established through research focused on detecting migrant children. Nevertheless, after stressful times, it is more important to consider stress from aspect to recognize stressful periods and stressful incidents that cause each stressful period. This paper identifies the problem of the recognition of migrant children in the open social network microblog stressful periods and stressor events. Besides, the improved Poisson-dependent probability model has been developed and focused on the study of the postings of migrant children during stressful activities in schools to compare stressors with a set of postings on Tencent Weibo (microblog). Through this model the average stressed times of migrant children which obtains more information regarding potential stressors affecting stressed periods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTable  3  compares the results when derived stress factors in the highest stressful time are classified as top 1 and top 3. As the first is stricter, the F1 results are 15.2% smaller than the latter, mainly due to a decrease in the recall by 9.56 points.\n\nEvaluation with the State-of-the-Art Approach to Personal Event Identification\nWhile there are no methods to recognizing young people with traumatic periods and challenging events in the research on the traumatic era, our linguistic system of stressors is similar to that of the state-of-the-art predictive approach to the recognition of personal life events Table  4 . It analyzes the stressor incidents found that the overall traumatic times (not restricted to the aspect of the school life). It counts the number of instances of any stressor overall observed cumulative stress times for each student and measures their occurrence rate by the amount / overall stressful duration. Table  5  indicates the total student event rates of grades. The highest stressors among both classes are self-awareness and school life. This is consistent with the migrant children's psychological study and leads to problems with the inner cognitions of migrant children in school lives.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMigrant children are now a core tool for the Chinese urban social community. Effective incorporation into urban schools of migrant children is the prerequisite for well-being, financial prosperity, and social stability. However, the dual household registration (hukou) (or ruralurban stratification system) that prevents equitable access to public facilities, including schooling for migrant children  (Liu 2013) , is among the most compelling structural barriers to integration. There are many drawbacks for students at a traditional migrant school in the residential region of a communityincluding a shortage of teaching positions  (Shakeel and Baskar 2020) , outdated infrastructure for schooling and inadequate instructional content and equipment. Migrant children are more likely to live in distress relative to the metropolitan equivalent, undergo psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, endure discrimination and victimization and report crime  (Joshi et al. 2019) . Besides economic drawbacks, the acculturation and well-being of migrant children are further constrained by a lack of cultural resources and social isolation in the region (Fig.  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTable  1  mentions several common events, their duration, the frequency of student performance assessment and the overall frequencies in the observed 3 years.

Firstly, the facial expression image is normalized, and the edge of each layer of the image is extracted in the convolution process. The extracted edge information is superimposed on each feature image to preserve the edge structure information of the texture image. Then, the dimensionality reduction of the extracted implicit features is processed by the maximum pooling method. Finally, the expression of the test sample image is classified and recognized by using a Softmax classifier. To verify the robustness of this method for facial expression recognition under a complex background, a simulation experiment is designed by scientifically mixing the Fer-2013 facial expression database with the LFW data set. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average recognition rate of 88.56% with fewer iterations, and the training speed on the training set is about 1.5 times faster than that on the contrast algorithm. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUnder the trend of artificial intelligence, the communication between human and computer becomes easier and easier.

The possibility of severe vision loss can be extensively reduced by timely diagnosis and treatment. An automated screening for DR has been identified as an effective method for early DR detection, which can decrease the workload associated to manual grading as well as save diagnosis costs and time. Several studies have been carried out to develop automated detection and classification models for DR. This paper presents a new IoT and cloud-based deep learning for healthcare diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The proposed model incorporates different processes namely data collection, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. At first, the IoT-based data collection process takes place where the patient wears a head mounted camera to capture the retinal fundus image and send to cloud server. Then, the contrast level of the input DR image gets increased in the preprocessing stage using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) model. Next, the preprocessed image is segmented using Adaptive Spatial Kernel distance measure-based Fuzzy C-Means clustering (ASKFCM) model. Afterwards, deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based Inception v4 model is applied as a feature extractor and the resulting feature vectors undergo classification in line with the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model. The proposed model was tested using a benchmark DR MESSIDOR image dataset and the obtained results showcased superior performance of the proposed model over other such models compared in the study. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSeveral DLbased techniques are designed to examine the retinal fundus images and to develop automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models for DR  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . A novel technology was designed in the literature  [8]  to determine the disease intensity under cloud and IoT applications. This technique was applied to predict the seriousness of the illness. The above technology was deployed to take unique care of student's and children's health. In this study, a programmatic health information, termed as student data, was created with the help of reputed UCI Repository as well as sensors employed in medical domain. This was deployed also to forecast diverse ailments which have been influenced by student with severity. Followed by, several other classification models were applied to predict different types of diseases. The major application of this algorithm is the determination of prediction accuracy using few attributes like F-measure, specificity as well as sensitivity. Consequently, it is evident that the presented technique outperformed with respect to prediction accuracy when compared with previous methodologies.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nKakria et al.  [18]  employed a novel online health care observation technology to monitor the remote heart patients often using mobile phones and wearable sensors. Subsequently, Kim et al.  [19]  established a technique to monitor the emergency scenario under the application of content of motion tracking disease patients. Some other models are also found in Jebaseeli et al.  [20] . Roychowdhury et al.  [21]  developed a new DREAM: Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Using Machine Learning model which investigates the fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view. The severity level of DR can be generated by the use of ML models such as Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost. Among the classifiers, GMM and kNN are found to be effective while classifying bright and red lesions respectively. Adal et al.  [22]  has developed a robust and flexible method to automatically detect the longitudinal retinal modifications because of small red lesions through the utilization of the normalized fundus images. It reduces the illumination differences and enhances the contrast level of small retinal features.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHence, the variables associated with these normal distributions could be derived using, m X l jC\u00bcc \u00bc 1 N c X N c l\u00bc1 x l (21) s 2 X l jC\u00bcc \u00bc 1 N c X N c l\u00bc1 x l 2 \u00c0m 2 (22) where N c denotes the count of instance where C \u00bc c whereas N represents the number of overall examples applied in training.

To address these problems, we propose a new and robust Local Adjacent Extrema Pattern (LAEP) is a feature descriptor for fingerprint classification. The proposed descriptor finds it values based on indexes of local adjacent extremas using first order derivatives. The intensity values of the local extremas are compared with center pixel intensity value to employ the correlation of central pixel with its neighbors. Finally, the descriptor is generated on the support of the indexes and local extremas values. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for classification of fingerprint images into five classes. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor, we have tested on Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) - Indian rural fingerprint database for classification. In addition, the classification results of the proposed descriptor are compared with the existing methods. The resultant LAEP descriptor proved better classification accuracy than the previous methods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTo facilitate high performance classification, in this paper, we used only adjacent neighbours because it reduces the dimension of the descriptor and contain most of the local edge information. The remaining sections of this research paper include, section 2 proposes a descriptor based fingerprint classification model using local adjacent extrema pattern. Section 3 describes about SVM. Section 4 presents classification results and performance analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\n\nLocal Adjacent Extrema Pattern\nLocal adjacent extrema pattern has derived as a new feature descriptor for fingerprint classification form center pixel and its local neighbours. The first order local adjacent derivative is used to extract the local adjacent extrema (maxima and minima) pattern. The connection of local adjacent extrema with the center pixel plays a major role to encode the LAEP descriptor. Local adjacent extrema are extracted of any center pixel by using first order local adjacent derivatives.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdaboost learning methodology was used by Liu  [9]  in fingerprint classification algorithm to model multiple types of singularity features. Karu and Jain  [10]  proposed fingerprint classification based on extracting the singular points such as core and delta. Still, many researchers are working on extracting the singular points for classification but it is challenging to obtain the better result. To lead the issue, the texture patterns are used for any image classification. A few researchers are working on fingerprint classification to extract the patterns with learning methodologies such as SVMs, neural network, etc. The Local Binary Patterns (LBP)  [11]  worked based on sign of difference between central pixels with its local neighbours.

An energy efficient clustering method, depending on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the Fractional Artificial Bee Colony (FABC) algorithm, has a propensity to maximize the energy of the network and life time of nodes by the optimal cluster head selection (CHS). When conveying data, an ABC-Dynamic Scout bee algorithm is presented that multiplies the scout bee production to enlarge the number of alive nodes and the of CH energy. An assessment among the performances of the implemented ABC-based Dynamic Scout bee algorithm routing mechanism in opposition to that of ABC-based CHS and FABC-based CHS routing is done. The experimental outcome demonstrates that the implemented method increases the quantity of alive nodes with 25% of maximum energy for the normalized network compared with conventional protocols. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSubsequent to these values, the model is implemented until it arrives at dead nodes.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn this section, the statistical analysis of the conventional and the implemented system is analyzed depending on the two factors, namely, energy and distance by means of the fitness parameter. Figure  4  demonstrates the convergence graph concerning the number of iterations. From Figure  4 , the convergence analysis for the proposed ADCHS method concerning the number of iteration is 8.3% better than the ACHS method and 2.7% better than the FACHS method. Thus, the capability of the proposed ADCHS method is proved to be better when compared with the existing methods: % \u00f0 \u00de=\n\nCost function of the implemented technique \u00c0 Cost function of the conventional technique Cost function of the conventional technique \u00f020\u00de\nThe iteration is continued until it attains at the dead node. From Figure  5 , the statistical analysis of the proposed ADCHS technique with respect to the number of nodes can be determined. From the analysis, it is known that the implemented method is 16.6% superior to the ACHS method and 22.2% superior to the FACHS technique.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHence, it is shown that the proposed ADCHS method offers an increased number of alive nodes with an  increase in the number of nodes. Similarly, from Figure  6 , the normalized network energy in terms of the number of rounds is obtained. From the analysis, it is known that the implemented ADCHS technique is 20% better than both the ACHS and FACHS methods. Figure  7  shows the statistical analysis of the implemented ADCHS algorithm and conventional ACHS and FACHS algorithms, by considering the CH count that is selected at each particular round. In the final round 2000, a sum of 10 CHs is selected in the implemented ADCHS algorithm. The figure legibly exposes the statement that the count of CHs that is chosen with the implemented ADCHS algorithm goes beyond the traditional ACHS and FACHS algorithms.\n\nCHS performance\nThe bar chart for the contrast of the traditional FACHS and ACHS algorithms and the implemented ADCHS algorithm by means of the distance among CHs is revealed in Figure  8 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, the capability of the proposed ADCHS algorithm is verified. Table  6  summarizes the analysis on alive nodes and normalized network energy by varying the limits of the scout bee size for population size 25.\n\nConclusion\nIn a WSN, choosing and optimally positioning the CH is the main feature. CH routing is executed between the base    station and the sensor node for data interaction. A principle dynamic scout bee (DS) has been incorporated along with the ACHS technique to produce several scout bee solutions for choosing the CH that signifies the WSN. The presentation demonstrated by the implemented ADCHS method has been verified with the two major factors of routing methods, energy and distance. The results acquired following the testing of the implemented ADCHS technique have been distinguished with the ACHS and FACHS techniques by means of the number of alive nodes and energy in network. The implemented ADCHS technique has been established to offer less consumption of energy, along with an increase in the number of alive nodes at every iteration compared with the conventional ACHS and FACHS algorithms.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs technological solutions contributing to the development of a sustainable environment may allow progressive socioeconomic changes for environmental sustainability  (Cazorla-Montero et al., 2019; Bazan-Krzywosza\u0144ska et al., 2019) . These traditionally established technical approaches for water management and sustainable practice often reflect standard water governance  (How et al., 2020) . The Sustainability Index (SI) analyses the efficiency of different water policies and the environment and the system's capacity to reduce its vulnerability using artificial intelligent techniques  (Prabakaran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) . The index shows that the system has a higher adaptive capacity for a suggested policy that makes the system more ecological effective  (Goralski and Tan, 2020) . The sustainability index integrates performance standards that capture the basin's important and long-awaited sustainabilities  (Cernev and Fenner, 2020)  for environment management using AI  (Zhang et al., 2019) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 and Section 2 discussed the introduction and related works on sustainable development of water environment based on ecological engineering intelligent planning. In Section 3, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed. In Section 4, the numerical results have been analyzed, and the consistency of the data is evaluated. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research paper with a future perspective.\n\nRelated works\nAjay Gajanan Bhave et al.  (Fritz et al., 2019)  introduced the Decision-Making Under uncertainty (DMUU) approach for water resource planning. A water supply model is satisfactorily optimized and validated with the observed streamflow. In model simulations, almost all conditions increased the potential to meet such performance metrics without adaptation. The change options partly compensate for the effects of change, and the sequence of choices in adaptation processes according to stakeholder priorities impacts metric fulfillment. Early emphasis on agricultural demand control increases robustness and trade-offs between intra-basin water quality and basin-wide water availability. They prove that the best balance between demand and water supply is prone to future uncertainty and changes. Qiang  Wang et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe index allows it more comfortable to compare policies as the performance criteria for effective environmental planning and management  (Qian et al., 2019; Sachs et al., 2019) . Fig.  1  shows the sustainable water resource management and its impacts. As inferred from Fig.  1 . The current water availability needs an effective resource management solution to satisfy the supply and demand ratio based on the food cycle. The water demand is rising, and the river basin's water management challenges exceeded their carrying ability, contributing to clear inconsistencies between supply and demand due to climatic changes  (Abdo and Zeadally, 2020) . Local water conservation aims at creating resilience in towns and cities that are living, efficient, and safe. Evaluation of sustainable water resources management requires responsibility for the actual overhead expense of water management. Water resources management has to be responsible. Socio-economic and environmental dimensions that are also not readily expressed in the quantitative principles needed for comprehensive planning, decision making, monitoring, and assessment Evaluation models include potential environmental sustainability metrics, which are used in comparing management strategies in different organizations and ecosystems for site modeling analyses to help individual administrators and policymakers to measure progress towards sustainable practices.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

To decrease the time cost in manual work, text classification techniques are applied to automatically identify severity of bug reports. In this paper, we address the problem of low-quality and class imbalance for identifying the severity of bug reports. First, we combine feature selection with instance selection to simultaneously reduce the bug report dimension and the word dimension, which could get small-scale and high-quality reduced data set. Then, an improve random oversampling technique, named, RSMOTE, which is presented to weaken the imbalancedness degree of class distribution. Finally, to avoid the random over-sampling uncertainty of RSMOTE, we develop an ensemble learning algorithm, which is based on Choquet fuzzy integral, to combine multiple RSMOTE. We empirically investigate the performance of data reduction on ten data sets of three large open source projects, namely, Eclipse, Mozilla, and GNOME. The results show that our approach can effectively reduce the data scale and improve the performance of identifying the severity of bug reports. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBesides feature selection in defect prediction. Kim et al.  [36]  introduced an approach to measure the noise resistance in defect prediction and how to detect noise data. Xu  [27]  uses seven approaches to reduce the dimension of dataset, which could improve the performance of classification results. Yang et al.  [29]  uses three commonly feature selection, IG, CHI, Correlation Coefficient to reduce the noise from 4 opensource components from Eclipse and Mozilla.  Zhang [3958]  represents a concept profile-based approach to assign the severity of bug reports. They build the concept profiles based on historical bug reports. Then, the new bug reports come, they assign the severity of new coming bug report by measuring the similarity and severity concepts.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn the context of software maintenance, a bug with high severity is typically associated with fatal errors and crashes. Therefore, the automatic prediction of the severity of bug reports could considerably reduce manpower requirements and improve the efficiency of bug resolution.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn their subsequent article, Feng et al.  [31]  considers that the bug reports with screenshots and descriptive text. They could assist inspections of crowdsourced bug reports by using a multi-objective optimization-based prioritization technique. Wang et al.  [32]  proposes a clusterbased classification approach to identify ''good'' bug reports from the crowdsoured testing bug reports. The approach could overcome the local bias of crowdsoured testing bug reports. In their subsequent article, Wang et al.  [33]  proposes a method named Local-based Active Classification (LOAF) to address bug reports with the local bias problem and the lack of labeled information in crowdsoured testing. To improve the data quality, Khoshgoftaar et al.  [34]  and Gao et al.  [17]  use six feature selection approaches to reduce the bug dataset, meanwhile, use three data sampling approaches (RUS, ROS, SMOTE) to handle imbalanced defect data. Shivaji et al.  [6]  proposes a framework to examine multiple feature selection algorithms and remove noise features in classification-based defect prediction. Besides feature selection in defect prediction. Kim et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHigh-dimension is caused by the bug reports are submitted by testers from all over the world, and for each tester, the understanding and natural language description of bugs are different, which could result in large-scale and low-quality bug reports in bug repositories  [1] . A number of problems may arise due to the large-scale and low-quality, such as extensive computation and a decline in predictive performance. Class imbalance occurs when the number of bug reports in one class (majority-class) is obviously more than the other class (minority-class). This problem is more prevalent in bug repository (such Eclipse, Mozilla, and GNOME), where the proportion of severe bug reports is relatively larger than nonsevere bug reports. The primary drawback of imbalanced dataset is that traditional classification algorithms tend to misclassify minority-class bug reports as majority-class bug reports. Some investigators have try to solve these problem  [9] ,  [17] -  [19] . For the high-dimension problem, Gao et al.

In this work, we present a cost-effective route to synthesize the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite by using cheap metal hydrides and aluminum chloride as starting reagents and to achieve liquid state reactive milling. The LiH/AlCl3 and MgH2/AlCl3 reaction systems were systemically explored. The phase identification of the obtained products was carried out by XRD and the morphology observed by TEM characterization. It was found that the \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite can be successfully synthesized by reactive milling of commercial AlCl3 and LiH in a neutral ionic liquid ([2-Eim] OAc). Based on XRD analysis and TEM observation, an average grain size of 56 nm can be obtained by the proposed mechanochemical process. By setting the isothermal dehydrogenation temperature between 80 and 160 \u00b0C, the as-synthesized \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite exhibits an advantage in hydrogen desorption capacity and has fast dehydriding kinetics. The hydrogen desorption content of 9.93 wt% was achieved at 160 \u00b0C, which indicates the potential utilization of the prepared nanocomposite in hydrogen storage applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nAn extensive amount of research has been focused on developing a viable, safe and efficient technique for hydrogen storage. Most importantly, various hydrogen storage materials, such as the light metal hydride and their complexes, have been extensively explored over the recent years. 1, 2 Among these materials, aluminium hydride (AlH 3 ) is one of the most promising candidates due to its high theoretical hydrogen storage capacity (10.08 wt. %) and low decomposition temperature (100-200 \u00b0\u0421).  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Compared to other metal hydride or hydrogen storage materials, AlH 3 is an ideal candidate for a wide array of applications, such as solid rocket propellant and hydrogen-fuel cells.  [9] [10] [11]  Hence, several research groups have investigated the synthesis methods and hydrogenstorage performance of AlH 3 polymorphs.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, it has been reported that the metallic Al forms during the room temperature ball milling, which can be partially attributed to the heterogeneity of solid-state reaction and leads to the decomposition of AlH 3 . Though the cryo-milling process has the potential to prevent the AlH 3 from dehydriding, the much lower temperature also raises technical challenges on large-scale production of \u03b1-AlH 3 . Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as promising environmentfriendly solvents in organic synthesis and offer distinct advantages, such as non-flammability, low volatility, low toxicity and high thermal and chemical stability. 32, 33 ILs are also extremely important because they can be used as a solvent in catalyst-free reactions. To date, series of catalyst-free reactions are employed and completed in ILs due to the ease of the experimental procedure, low cost and eco-friendly process. 34, 35 Due to the advantages offered by ILs over traditional approaches, we aimed to employ ILs solvent to synthesize \u03b1-AlH 3 . In order to stabilize the obtained \u03b1-AlH 3 during the mechanochemical process, the selection of ionic liquid is critical.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n25  It has been demonstrated by Paskevicius et al.  26  that the AlH 3 can be formed via a mechanochemical reaction of LiAlH 4 and AlCl 3 at lower or room temperature, which results in several polymorphs (\u03b1-, \u03b1'-, and \u03b3 -AlH 3 ) with the crystalline size of 15 -17 nm. Nevertheless, this work was solely focused on the mechanochemical synthesis of AlH 3 composite rather than aiming for a specific crystal structure. The as-milled AlH 3 , with some variations in its crystal structures, ultimately leads to the complexity of the extraction. This solid state mechanochemical method has also been adopted for use by other researchers to produce nanosized \u03b1-AlH 3 composite.  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  Because of its widespread use, it is evident that mechanochemical method is a valid and wellestablished method for the synthesis of nano-sized \u03b1-AlH 3 composite.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In present work, a convenient and cost-efficient solid-state mechanochemical reaction is proposed to obtain \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite. With the addition of TiF3, \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite was formed in a short period by milling of LiH and AlCl3. Based on XRD and NMR results, the average grain size of the \u03b1-AlH3 in the nano-composite was 45\u2009nm. The reaction pathway as well as the synergistic effect of TiF3 on the solid state reaction between LiH and AlCl3 were confirmed. In the \u03b1-AlH3/LiCl nano-composite, TiF3 reduced the temperature of dehydriding reaction and improved dehydrogenation rate of \u03b1-AlH3. Within the temperature range between 80 and 160\u2009\u00b0C, dehydrogenation of the as-milled \u03b1-AlH3 nano-composite showed fast kinetics. At 160\u2009\u00b0C, a maximum hydrogen desorption of 9.92\u2009wt% was obtained within 750\u2009s, very close to the theoretical hydrogen capacity of \u03b1-AlH3. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nHydrogen, as a clean and renewable energy source, has received wide attention  [1] [2] [3] . However, the major obstacle for a widespread hydrogen utilization is the challenges in storage  [4] . The hydrogen storage technology includes gas storage, liquid storage and solid-state hydrogen storage method which is different from other storage technologies such as CO 2 adsorption and storage technology  [1, 5, 6] . Solidstate hydrogen storage methods offer advantages, such as the lower safety risk, over high-pressure and cryogenic approaches  [7] . Additionally, solid materials have excellent volumetric and gravitational storage capacities. Therefore, a lot of efforts have been undertaken in research and development of solid-state hydrogen storage materials as well as storage systems  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Research of safe, recyclable and cheap hydrogen storage materials, such as the light metal hydrides and their complexes, is the focus of the most recent studies; however, several issues still remain unsolved  [4, [10] [11] [12] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, the coordinated Al species in Li-Al-H is different from that in Al-H. Grubisic demonstrated that for the other aluminum hydride clusters such as Al x H x+2 (3 \u2264 \u00d7 \u2264 8), the polyhedral structure of Al-H cannot be formed with six polymorphic modifications  [77] . Thus, it can be deduced that polymers Al-H x (x = 1, 2, 3 the coordinated Al species is six polymorphic modification) in an amorphous state was formed during the milling process. After milling for 3 h, LiAlCl 4 NMR peak disappeared (Fig.  7c ), thus, it is very likely that LiAlCl 4 as an intermediate product were entirely consumed in the reaction. Additionally, peak corresponding to the 6-coordinated Al changed significantly, which was due to the phase conversion of the intermediate products during extended milling. Thus, NMR can be used as an indicator of the mechanochemical reaction termination. Humphries and Hwang associated the resonance bands at \u02dc6.0 ppm with the \u03b1-AlH 3 phase  [78, 79] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEffect of TiF 3 on mechanochemical reaction\nSartori demonstrated that FeF 3 not only accelerated nucleation of the as-milled metal hydride  [63] , but also affected crystalline structure during cryo-milling processes. TiF 3 can act as a seed crystal for formation of \u03b1-AlH 3 . To investigate the influence of TiF 3 effect on the reaction rate of the mechanochemical reaction of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture and crystallization of the AlH 3 more clearly, we studied XRD patterns of products of mechanochemical reactions of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixtures with the presence of the TiF 3 powder at a 3:1:0.1 M ratio milled at 400 rpm with a BPR 200:1 in Ar at 10 MPa for 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 h (see Fig.  5 ). After milling for 0.5 h, LiH and AlCl 3 XRD peaks disappeared, however, complete conversion of the LiH/AlCl 3 mixture into AlH 3 and LiCl phases did not occur.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Using this approach, patients with myocardial infarction can be differentiated from those with unstable angina. The present study aims to develop an integrated model, based on the feature selection and classification, for the automatic classification of ACS.\nMethods: A dataset containing medical records of 809 patients suspected to suffer from ACS was used. For each subject, 266 clinical factors were collected. At first, a feature selection was performed based on interviews with 20 cardiologists; thereby 40 seminal features for classifying ACS were selected. Next, a feature selection algorithm was also applied to detect a subset of the features with the best classification accuracy. As a result, the feature numbers considerably reduced to only seven. Lastly, based on the seven selected features, eight various common pattern recognition tools for classification of ACS were used.\nResults: The performance of the aforementioned classifiers was compared based on their accuracy computed from their confusion matrices. Among these methods, the multi-layer perceptron showed the best performance with the 83.2% accuracy.\nConclusion: The results reveal that an integrated AI-based feature selection and classification approach is an effective method for the early and accurate classification of ACS and ultimately a timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, a tremendous performance from this classifier should not be expected.\n\nNaive Bayes\nApplying Naive Bayes classifier, each new sample is assigned to the most probable class based on the Bayes decision making. The probability functions of the classes are empirically estimated from the training data. In spite of the low computational complexity, this method has a relatively high performance  [20] .\n\nIterative dichotomiser-3\nDecision trees are powerful and effective approaches to create a classification model. This method is a flow-chart-like tree structure, where a tree is constructed by the \"if-then\" rules (i.e. A logical sequence of questions) extracted from the training data  [9, 21] . A new case can be classified by starting at the root of the tree and moving through it until a leaf is encountered. Decision trees have become one of the most widely applied methods among numerous classification approaches, because these are white box models with easy-to-interpret results. In addition, its construction does not need any domain knowledge or parameter setting and thus is appropriate for exploratory knowledge discovery  [22, 23] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nID3 is one of the major algorithms of decision tree which was used in this study.\n\nBagging-ID3\nBagging (Bootstrap aggregating) is a popular approach proposed by Bremen  [24, 25]  which is considered as an ensemble meta-algorithm to build classification models. This resampling-based technique can be incorporated into various classification algorithms or regression methods. This incorporation resulted in reducing the variance associated with the prediction models, and thereby improves the predictive performance of these models. Bagging consists of creating numerous bootstrap replicates of the learning set by drawing \"B\" simple random samples with replacement (bootstrap samples) from the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Then, the considered prediction model is applied to each \"B\" bootstrap sample (i.e. new learning sets). To construct the final model, the results (i.e. the \"B\" built models) subsequently are combined into an ensemble by averaging for regression and simple voting for classification  [26] [27] [28] . In fact, the true strength of bagging approach is for unstable models, such as decision trees and neural networks. Unstable models are sensitive to small alterations in the dataset.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUnstable models are sensitive to small alterations in the dataset. Hence, training the same model on two slightly different training sets might result in substantially different models (i.e. The models with different parameters similar overall accuracies)  [25, 29] . Thus, bagging can be a good solution to overcome this problem. In order to overcome unstably of the ID3, classifier bagging can be incorporated into the ID3 and emerge Bagging-ID3 classifier.\n\nFeature selection\nFeature selection is one of the important steps in a classification problem. In reality, there are usually many redundant features which do not have any contributions in discriminating classes. Moreover, redundant features increase the complexity of the classification algorithm. Thus, they may have an effect on the performance of the model and may decrease its accuracy as well. There are two main approaches for performing dimensionality reduction of high dimensional data  [18] . The first approach is feature extraction, which focuses on transforming the existing features into a lower dimensional space. Most feature extraction methods have been based on two major linear techniques: principal components analysis and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis  [16, 18] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Studies show different and inconsistent prevalence rates in Iran. This study aims to determine the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult through a meta-analysis approach.\nMethods: The present meta-analysis was conducted between January 2000-August 2019. Articles related to the subject matter were obtained by searching Scopus, Sciencedirect, SID, magiran, Barakat Knowledge Network System, Medline (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases. The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using I2 index and the data were analyzed in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.\nResults: In a study of 3948 individuals aged 50-90 years, the overall prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult was 8.2% (95% CI, 4.14-6.3%) based on meta-analysis. Also, in order to investigate the effects of potential factors (sample size and year of study) on the heterogeneity of severe depression in Iranian older adult, meta-regression was used. It was reported that the prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult decreased with increasing sample size and increasing years of the study, which is significantly different (P < 0.05).\nConclusion: Considering the high prevalence of severe depression in Iranian older adult, it is necessary for health policy makers to take effective control measures and periodic care for the older adult. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOther review, case-control, cohort, and intervention studies were excluded from the list of articles. The studies were then reviewed based on fourphase PRISMA (2009. STROBE checklist was used to review studies. This checklist consists of various methodological aspects, including study objectives, determination of appropriate sample size, type of study, sampling method, research population, data collection method, definition of variables and procedure, study data collection tool, study objectives, statistical tests, and findings. Accordingly, a maximum quality evaluation score of 32 was considered and articles with scores below 14 were excluded from the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA version 3), the heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I 2 test and probability of publication bias Funnel chart using Egger test and significance level 0.05 and also to investigate the effects of potential factors on heterogeneity of studies from Meta-regression test.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBackground\nOlder adult is an inevitable biological process that affects all living things and is associated with unpleasant experiences in some cases  [1] . The aging process refers to the gradual decline in the function of the body's systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, endocrine glands, and immune system  [2] . Social, economic, and scientific developments in recent years have increased life expectancy and reduced mortality rates, leading to an increase in the world's older adult population  [3] . The older adult population is estimated to be doubled during next 40 years in the world  [4] . Today, aging has become a major global phenomenon and according to WHO statistics, the number of older adult in Southwest Asian countries, including Iran, will reach 15% of the total population by 2030  [5] . Other reports suggest that the number of people aged \u226560 years will increase from 841 million people in 2013 to 1.2 billion people in 2025, with 70% of them living in developing countries and 8 out of every 10 older adult people in the world are expected to live in developing areas by 2050  [6] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIncreased rates of depression in the older adult, especially the severe type reported in this study, are often neglected, making it difficult to diagnose and treat the disease in a timely manner. This is an unfortunate reality because depression is a disorder for which effective treatments are available today. The results of interventional studies Legrand et al.  [35]  and Koshyar et al.  [36]  were indicated in the reducing depression: regular physical activity and appropriate diet were Reduced the level of depression, These studies reported that both outdoors and indoors 15-min selfpaced walks and Participating in enjoyable and pleasant exercises were associated with significant and positive affective, There is scientific agreement that exercise temporarily makes people feel more positively activated so that more frequent exercise may lead to a greater cumulative effect on positive affect and perhaps more opportunities to reduce negative thoughts and ruminative processes  [35, 36] . It is also worth noting that the reduced mental ability and the feeling of sadness is not part of the normal aging process and this mood state should be considered important  [34, 37] ; therefore, considering the foregoing, screening and secondary prevention measures by nurses and healthcare providers are of great importance.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This association is so conspicuous in the case of bees that other groups of potential pollinators, especially flies, have long been underestimated. However, visitors are not always pollinators. While the importance of flies in plant-visitor networks is now acknowledged, their pollination effectiveness has hardly been investigated. In this study, we assessed the pollination effectiveness of Geranium sylvaticum flower-visitors using single-visit seed set experiments, in a subalpine meadow where flies are predominant. We found that: (i) empidine dance flies were the most frequent visitors of G. sylvaticum; (ii) a single-visit by an empidine dance fly produced the same average number of seeds as a visit by a bee; (iii) large pollinators were more efficient than small pollinators irrespective of their identity. As a conclusion, large empidines were the main pollinators of G. sylvaticum. Considering the high diversity and abundance of flower-visiting fly species, such results showing their ability to be as effective pollinators as bees should encourage further studies to develop a better understanding on their role in plant-pollinator networks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs visits by large bees or empidines   Considering how frequently interactions between empidines and numerous flowering plant species have been reported in the literature since Darwin  [13, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , it is surprising that their role in the reproductive success of those plants had never been addressed. They are obligate floral-visitors with more than 2000 described species worldwide which, contrary to the commonly accepted assumptions that they are generalists and poor pollinators, could reveal high levels of specialization and the same pollination efficiency as bees. Their high abundance and diversity throughout the favourable season suggest that they are important pollinators in mountains and at high latitudes  [14] . Like empidine dance flies, numerous species of calliphorids, conopids, muscids, anthomyids, tabanids and many other fly families depend on nectar and pollen for feeding. In habitats where bees are unable to thrive, flies often represent the predominant biotic vector carrying pollen grains from one flower to another, and therefore the main potential pollinators. Funding.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFlies (Diptera) represent the most conspicuous group of flower-visitors and potential pollinators after bees  [5] [6] [7] , especially in cool to cold habitats of high altitude or latitude where wild bees become naturally scarcer  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, most studies including dipterans address only flower visitation frequencies, which King et al.  [15]  consider a poor proxy for pollinator effectiveness. Visitors are indeed not always pollinators, a visit being likely to enhance the reproductive success of a plant only when it results in conspecific pollen deposition on its stigma. Therefore, direct measures of pollinator effectiveness and plant reproductive success should be performed, respectively, through single-visit stigmatic pollen deposition and seed set after single-visit experiments  [16, 17] . To our knowledge, very few studies include such experiments on flower-visiting Diptera, although some of them challenge the common assumption that bees are the best pollinators: e.g.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nhoverflies can pollinate strawberries as efficiently as bees  [18] , and a blowfly (Calliphoridae) was shown to be as efficient as honeybees and other flower-visitors together in pollinating hybrid carrots  [19] . Moreover, the first study comparing syrphids with other Diptera found no differences in pollen-loads specialization  [20] . Those results cast light on the lack of knowledge about the role played by most flower-visiting fly families in the pollination of angiosperms. To assess the effectiveness of dipterans as pollinators of a wild plant relative to other foraging insects, we used Geranium sylvaticum L. and its flower-visitors as a model, in a subalpine environment where wild bees are scarce. Our objectives were: (i) to quantify the visitor cortege of G. sylvaticum; (ii) to assess the pollination effectiveness of the main flower-visitors using single-visit seed set experiments; (iii) to test whether pollination effectiveness was related to species identity or species traits, such as body size and visit duration.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Females may compensate for their loss of male fitness by reallocating resources from male function (pollen production and pollinator attraction) to female function (seeds and fruits), thus increasing seed production. Females may also benefit from their inability to self-fertilize if selfing and inbreeding depression reduce seed quality in hermaphrodites. We investigated how differences in floral resource allocation (flower size) between female and hermaphroditic plants affect two measures of female reproductive success, pollinator visitation and pollen receipt, in gynodioecious populations of Geranium richardsonii in Colorado. Using emasculation treatments in natural populations, we further examined whether selfing by autogamy and geitonogamy comprises a significant proportion of pollen receipt by hermaphrodites. Flowers of female plants are significantly smaller than those of hermaphrodites. The reduction in allocation to pollinator-attracting structures (petals) is correlated with a significant reduction in pollinator visitation to female flowers in artificial arrays. The reduction in attractiveness is further manifested in significantly less pollen being deposited on the stigmas of female flowers in natural populations. Autogamy is rare in these protandrous flowers, and geitonogamy accounts for most of the difference in pollen receipt between hermaphrodites and females. Female success at receiving pollen was negatively frequency dependent on the relative frequency of females in populations. Thus, two of the prerequisites for the maintenance of females in gynodioecious populations, differences in resource allocation between floral morphs and high selfing rates in hermaphrodites, occur in G. richardsonii. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSuch protandry suggests that avoidance of selfing has been a strong selection pressure in the evolution of G. richarsonii's floral biology and mating system. Selfing can depress fitness in both self-compatible and self-incompatible species due to inbreeding depression and interference between self-and outcross pollen, respectively (reviewed by  de Jong et al., 1993; Snow et al., 1996) .  Kearns (1990)  inferred that G. richardsonii was self-incompatible or required a minimum threshold quantity of pollen for successful self-fertilization based on a limited number of hand crosses. Recent hand pollination experiments (K. O'Malley, C. Williams, and M. Kuchenreuther, unpublished data) have shown that G. richardsonii does self and suffers inbreeding depression in fruit and seed set. Although autogamy appears rare in G. richardsonii, because of its large, asynchronous floral display, geitonogamy may contribute significantly to selfing in this species.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSimilarly high selfing rates have been found in hermaphrodites of other gynodioecious species (23-25% in Limnanthes douglasii-  Kesseli and Jain, 1984; 11-76% in Bidens-Sun and Ganders, 1986; 18-61% in Salvia pratensis, Van Treuren et al., 1993; 88-100% in Chionographis japonica-Maki, 1993; . 73% in Cucurbita foetidissima-  Kohn and Biardi, 1995; 68% in Schiedea adamantis-Sakai et al., 1997) . A puzzling result of the pollination experiments were the sometimes smaller estimates of pollen receipt on stigmas of unemasculated flowers than on emasculated flowers on unemasculated plants (U vs. E in autogamy experiment; C vs. U in geitonogamy experiment). A possible explanation for these results may be that the stamens, particularly the filaments, may act as a physical barrier to small pollinators contacting the stigmatic surface.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nGiven the large standard errors surrounding counts of pollen receipt, [Vol. 87 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY these figures only provide crude estimates of levels of autogamy and geitonogamy. They do suggest that selfing, primarily through geitonogamy, occurs at magnitudes sufficient to depress hermaphrodite fitness if selfing results in inbreeding depression. These estimates also appear to reflect actual levels of selfing occurring in the field. Genetic estimates of selfing rates, including geitonogamy, in open-pollinated hermaphrodites  (Ritland and Jain, 1981)  from four populations of G. richardsonii at RMBL ranged from 51 to 67% (mean \u03ed 61%) (K. O'Malley, C. Williams, and M. Kuchenreuther, unpublished data).  Agren and Willson (1991)  estimated that the selfing rates in two populations of Geranium maculatum were 60 and 73%, based on inbreeding depression.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, identifying epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs and characterizing their functional mechanisms in different cancer subtypes are still major challenges for cancer studies. In this study, we systematically analyzed the epigenetic alterations of lncRNAs at important regulatory elements in three breast cancer subtypes. We identified 87, 691, and 1,197 epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs in luminal, basal, and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, respectively. The landscape of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements revealed that epigenetic changes of the majority of lncRNAs occurred in a subtype-specific manner and contributed to subtype-specific biological functions. We identified six acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27ac)-dysregulated lncRNAs and three DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs (CTC-303L1.2, RP11-738B7.1, and SLC26A4-AS1) as prognostic biomarkers of basal subtype. These lncRNAs were involved in immune response-related biological functions. Treatment of the basal breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 with CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors downregulated H3K27 acetylation levels and caused a decrease in the expression of five H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs (LINC00393, KB-1836B5.1, RP1-140K8.5, AC005162.1, and AC020916.2) and inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells. One epigenetically dysregulated lncRNA (LINC01983) and four lncRNA regulators (UCA1, RP11-221J22.2, RP11-221J22.1, and RP1-212P9.3) were identified as prognostic biomarkers of the luminal molecular subtype of breast cancer by controlling the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation, and T cell migration. Finally, our results highlighted a profound role of enhancer-related H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs, DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs, and lncRNA regulators in breast cancer subtype carcinogenesis and their potential prognostic value. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nS2A ). These results suggest that lncRNAs with complex splicing patterns are more likely regulated by aberrant epigenetic modifications. In addition, we compared the expression level and expression variation of epi-lncRNAs with other lncRNAs to characterize the expression pattern of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess expression variation of genes among patients with breast cancer. lncRNAs showed substantially lower expression levels than did PCGs in all three breast cancer subtypes, which has been described in previous studies.  17  Interestingly, epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs displayed substantially higher expression levels and lower expression variation compared with other lncRNAs in all three breast cancer subtypes (p < 0.05). Consistently, we observed higher expression levels and lower expression variation of epigenetically dysregulated PCGs compared with other PCGs in the basal and claudin-low subtypes (p < 0.05; Figure  S2B ). These results suggest that epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs are stably expressed in breast cancer subtypes and may be suitable as potential biomarkers for breast cancer.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nepi-lncRNAs in the claudin-low subtype were mainly regulated by H3K27ac (78.27%) and H3K27me3 (14.98%) at enhancer elements (60.85%), which affected a large number of basic biological functions, including macromolecule metabolism, cellular macromolecule biosynthesis, and cellular protein modification processes (Figure  2C ). Overall, epi-lncRNAs in breast cancer subtypes were mainly associated with H3K27ac dysregulation (67.16%) within enhancer elements (Figure  2D ). However, lncRNAs with H3K27ac dysregulation affected different biological functions in different breast cancer subtypes, such as the necroptotic process in the luminal subtype, cell communication, cell proliferation, and immune system processes in the basal subtype, and macromolecule biosynthetic and protein modification processes in the claudin-low subtype (Figure  2D ). We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using Euclidean distance for breast cancer samples based on the expression of these lncRNAs to further characterize the important role of epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n18  Epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs at enhancer elements contributing to cancer subtype-specific functions The genomic distribution of epi-lncRNAs showed that abnormal histone modifications H3K27ac (47.91%), H3K4me3 (25.95%), and H3K4me1 (15.11%) within enhancers (77.77%) mainly contribute to dysregulation of lncRNAs in the basal subtype. Both H3K27ac-dysregulated lncRNAs and H3K4me1-dysregulated lncRNAs in the enhancer region are associated with regulation of cell cycle, immune system process, and cell communication based on guilt by association (Figure  2A ). epi-lncRNAs in the luminal subtype were mainly associated with H3K27ac (26.41%), H3K36me3 (25.90%), and H3K4me3 (19.49%) dysregulation at enhancer elements (53.46%), which mainly affected ripoptosome assembly involved in the necroptotic process (Figure  2B ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The first targeted therapy, sorafenib, prolonged the overall survival by months. However, resistance often occurs, largely limits its efficacy. Sorafenib was found to target the electron transport chain complexes, which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain sorafenib resistance and further facilitate tumor progression, cancer cells develop strategies to overcome excessive ROS production and obtain resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we investigated the roles of ROS in sorafenib resistance, and found suppressed ROS levels and reductive redox states in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells maintained greater functional and morphological integrity under the treatment of sorafenib. However, cellular oxygen consumption rate and mitochondria DNA content analyses revealed fewer numbers of mitochondria in sorafenib-resistant cells. Further investigation attributed this finding to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, likely caused by the accelerated degradation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC1\u03b2). Mechanistic dissection showed that upregulated UBQLN1 induced PGC1\u03b2 degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner to attenuate mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS production in sorafenib-resistant cells under sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, clinical investigations further indicated that the patients with higher UBQLN1 levels experienced worse recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, we propose a novel mechanism involving mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS homeostasis in sorafenib resistance, which may offer new therapeutic targets and strategies for HCC patients. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA lower mitochondrial volume is associated with the Warburg effect, which also contributes to tumor progression,  44  as well as being a critical metabolic characteristic of cell stemness restoration,  45  while both stemness maintenance and the Warburg effect contribute to sorafenib resistance.  46, 47  Another recent study  48  suggested that mitochondrial TXNRD3 confers drug resistance via a redox-mediated mechanism, further supporting the findings of our current study. In addition, the alterations of biological redox couples vary in different cell lines, suggesting a cell line-specific, but generally reductive reprogramming in sorafenib-resistant cells and OE-PGC1\u03b2 cells, compared with their controls. Mitochondrial biogenesis is a complex process.  21  Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the transcriptional family of PGC1, which is composed of PGC1\u03b1, PGC1-related coactivator, and PGC1\u03b2. These proteins interact with other transcription factors involved in mitochondrial gene expression to regulate genes encoding proteins Fig.  5  The role of UBQLN1 regulated PGC1\u03b2 degradation in sorafenib resistance.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n20  Recently, mitochondrial biogenesis was shown to be tightly linked to ROS production.  21  Studies found that the upregulation of mitochondrial content resulted in higher ROS levels under stress.  22, 23  Whether mitochondrial biogenesis-mediated ROS levels play a role in sorafenib resistance in HCC remains to be determined. In this study, we found alleviated ROS responses in sorafenibresistant HCC cells due to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. Mechanistic studies revealed that upregulation of UBQLN1 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells expedited the proteasome-mediated protein degradation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC1\u03b2), contributing to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation, finally inducing sorafenib resistance. These findings may provide a novel mechanism involving mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS homeostasis in sorafenib resistance, which may offer new therapeutic targets and strategies for HCC patients.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nDecreased ROS levels in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells\nTo mimic the biological process of sorafenib resistance in HCC patients, an in vitro model was established in this study, as described previously.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n30  Mitochondria and cellular homeostasis are accurately coordinated by mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the reduced mitochondrial content in resistant cells, we first evaluated mitochondria degradation. Mitophagy is a principle mechanism for mitochondria degradation and reduction of ROS stress.  31  We measured mitophagy levels in parental and resistant cells, and found that LC3II (reflects autophagic activity) levels were lower in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, with or without chloroquine (a classic inhibitor of autophagy that alters the acidic environment of lysosomes thus blocks the binding of autophagosomes to lysosomes; Fig.  3a, b ). Moreover, levels of the mitophagy-specific markers PARKIN and PINK were also reduced in resistant cells (Fig.  3c, d ).

These results indicated that mitophagy was decreased in resistant cells under sorafenib treatment, which is unlikely to explain the lower mitochondrial content in resistant cells.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion-anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep-charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion-anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof-of-concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium-based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 , and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDeveloping cost-effective energy storage systems is pivotally important in the implementation of intermittent renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind). Although lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in portable and automotive energy storage systems, the scarcity and uneven distribution of lithium element in Earths crust limit their large-scale applications. \n[1]  Non-lithium batteries such as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),  [2]  potassium-ion batteries (KIBs),  [3]  and aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs),  [4]  therefore, have attracted increasing research interests. However, the search for cation-intercalating cathode materials for these non-lithium rocking-chair batteries is challenging due to the larger ionic radius (e.g., Na + and K + ) or higher charge density (e.g., Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ) of post-lithium cations.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn this regard, it is of great significance to obtain further fundamental insights into the anion storage behavior for the sake of addressing the capacity bottleneck of graphite cathodes. In this work, we proposed an unconventional design strategy by employing locally ordered graphite carbon (LOGC) interconnected with disordered carbon as the anion-intercalating cathode, in order to overcome the capacity limit of defect-free graphite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the LOGC carbon materials with reduced layer size could effectively weaken the van der Waals interaction between adjacent graphene sheets and thus to reduce the anion-intercalating voltage attributed by the graphite expansion; meanwhile, disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion-anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. These merits eventually result in increased anion-storage capacity within the electrolyte electrochemical stability (EES) window. To validate this novel design strategy, commercial ketjen black (KB) with a typical LOGC structure was selected as a proof-of-concept cathode material for a potassium-based DIB (KDIB), while fully disordered activated carbon (AC) and fully ordered graphite were selected as the controlled cathodes.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor the calculations, we search the global minimum of each phase by enumerating the anion intercalation stage, anion arrangement, and initial graphite layer distance. Therefore, the blue dots on the convex hull represent the most stable anion intercalation configurations at each PF 6 \u00c0 content x, a species produced during the chargedischarge process. At x 0.5, we find at least three two-phase reactions upon anion intercalation into graphite, where the anion arrangement goes from stage VIII to IV to II. At x = 0.33, the formation energy of stage III is slightly above the convex hull, indicating a decomposition reaction into stage IV and II. While at 0.5 x 0.8, solid-solution reactions take place within stage II, until the final two-phase reaction between stage II and I at 0.8 x 1.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety. However, the poor processibility and relatively low ionic conductivity of Na+ and K+ ions limit the further practical applications of ISEs. PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na+ /K+ ion transfer is summarized. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/KIBs based on PEs are presented. Finally, some suggestions and perspectives are put forward to provide some possible directions for the follow-up researches. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[90]  To further improve the electrochemical properties of PEs, it is of significance to get fundamental insight into the migration mechanism and transfer kinetics of active ions in PEs. It is generally accepted that the Li + -ion migration in PEs is affected by the fracture/formation of coordination bonds in the segmented movement of polymer chains, which mainly occurs in the amorphous region of the polymer matrices.  [93]  For example, Li + ions first locate at the active site provided by the polar group of PEs (e.g., \ue0c6O\ue0c6 in PEO). Under the driving of the electric field, the local segmental motion of polymer chains induces Li + ions to move/leap from one coordination site to another adjacent active site, and thus realizes ion migration.  [62]  It is theoretically reasonable to infer that the migration of Na + /K + ions in PEs shares a similar mechanism with that of Li + ions, since Na + /K + ions have similar electrochemical activity with Li + ions. However, it is noteworthy that the migration process of different active ions in PEs is not only associated with the type of active ions (ionic radius, charge density, etc.)\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2. High cation migration number (T + \u2248 1). The cation migration number is a measure of the cation mobility in the PEs relative to the anion.  [91]  Reverse movement of anions without being deposited on the electrodes can cause concentration polarization, which results in increased internal impedances and reduced discharge voltages. Single ion conductive PE is used to limit the anion and increase the cation conductivity by covalently binding the anion to the polymer chain or adding an anion acceptor.  [204]  Therefore, how to restrict the migration Reproduced with permission.

[203]  Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. of anions in PEs is a key issue. However, note that different from in \"rocking-chair\" battery systems, in a DIB system, active ions include both cations and anions, which needs a comparable ion transfer kinetics for cations and anions. 3.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[99]  It has been demonstrated that ion migration in PEs is mainly carried out via the amorphous rather than crystalline regions. As a semicrystalline polymer, amorphous and crystalline phases coexist in PEO, which has been considered as one of the main reasons for low ionic conductivity of PEs.  [100, 101]  Many efforts have been devoted to limiting the crystallization level of PEO-based electrolytes, for example, the addition of nanofillers, blending polymers, screening of Na-salts, etc., and thus to increasing the amorphous phase and improving the ionic conductivity of PEO-based SPEs. Inorganic nanoparticles are widely used as nanofillers in PEs, which presents superiority in improving ionic conductivity over that without adding inorganic nanofillers.  [94, 102]  The improved effect can be ascribed to that nanoparticles form an associated network in the polymer and breach the ordered structure of PEO, which is conducive not only to improving the ionic conductivity but also to boosting their mechanical strength.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Dovefoot Geranium is a low-growing herb with pink flowers and sharply toothed leaves. Dovefoot Geranium is native to Eurasia and has been introduced to many habitats of the world. This species is very similar to G. robertianum but its palmate-like leaves and bilobed petals show differences. This plant is considered to be anodyne, astringent and vulnerary. We have no information on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Therefore, due to the importance of these plant species, we performed a combination of morphological and molecular data for this species. For this study, we used 132 randomly collected plants from 18 geographical populations in 4 provinces. Genetic diversity parameters were determined in these populations. STRUCTURE analysis and K-Means clustering identified 14 gene pools in the country and revealed isolation by distance among the studied populations. The Mantel test showed correlation between genetic and geographical distance. AMOVA revealed a significant genetic difference among populations and showed that 40% of total genetic variation was due to within-population diversity. The consensus tree of both molecular and morphological data identified divergent populations. These data may be used in future breeding and conservation of this important medicinal plant in the country. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDATA ANALYSES\n\n\nMorphological Studies\nMorphological characters were first standardized (Mean = 0, Variance = 1) and used to establish Euclidean distance among pairs of taxa  [23] . For grouping of the plant specimens, the UPGMA (Unweighted paired group using average) and Ward (Minimum spherical characters) as well as ordination methods of MDS (Multidimensional scaling) and PCoA (Principal coordinate analysis) were used  [23] . ANOVA (Analysis of variance) were performed to show morphological difference among the populations while, PCA (Principal components analysis) biplot was used to identify the most variable morphological characters among the studied populations  [23] . PAST version 2.17  [24]  was used for multivariate statistical analyses of morphological data.  \n\nKerman Kerman Kerman\nBandar-e-Abbas Bandar-e-Abbas Bandar-e-Abbas \n\nMolecular Analyses\nISSR bands obtained were coded as binary characters (presence = 1, absence = 0) and used for genetic diversity analysis.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis is particularly supported by STRUCTURE plot that identified 14 separate genetic groups within this populations and by consensus tree of both morphological and genetic data. Different mechanisms like isolation, drift, founder effects and local selection may act to bring about among population differentiation and therefore, populations differ in phenotypic traits and allelic composition  [36] . The present population divergence may be under influence of isolation-by distance across the distribution range of the studied G. molle populations. The dispersal of these populations might be constrained by distance and gene flow is most likely to occur between neighboring populations. As a result, more closely situated populations tend to be more genetically similar to one another  [43] [44] [45] . The populations, divergence may be accompanied by local adaptation. When we use multilocus molecular markers (such as SSR, AFLP, RAPD, ISSR, etc.) for population genetic studies we understand that these are neutral molecular markers (they are not directly acting as adaptive genes), but they may be linked to a gene or a genetic region with adaptive value  [26] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nParameter like Nei's gene diversity (H), Shannon information index (I), number of effective alleles, and percentage of polymorphism were determined  [25, 26] . Nei's genetic distance among populations was used for Neighbor Joining (NJ) clustering and Neighbor-Net networking  [26, 27] . The Mantel test was performe as implemented in PAST ver. 2.17  [23, 24] . For this, Nei genetic distance was determined for ISSR data, while Geographic distance of PAST was determined for geographical data. It is calculated based on the sum of the paired differences among both longitude as well as latitude coordinates of the studied populations. AMOVA (Analysis of molecular variance) test (with 1000 permutations) as implemented in GenAlex 6.4  [28]  and Nei,s Gst analysis as implemented in Geno-Dive ver.2 (2013)  [29]  were used to show genetic difference of the populations.

The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n20  \n\nInfluence of JP on bacterial diversity\nThe high-quality clean reads were >98.50% for all six samples, indicating a good sequencing depth for fecal microbiota gene analysis (Table  S1  \u2020). The flat curves of the base sequence and mass distribution demonstrated higher accuracy (Fig.  S1a \u2020 ). Using MEGAHIT software to assemble effective reads, the default length of KMER should be 21, 41, 61, 81, 99, and the length of contigs could exceed 600 in each group when the sum value reaches 90% of the total length of fragment (Table  S2  \u2020). Using the ReefSeq database in NCBI, fecal microbial genes were indexed and the species annotated using Meta-Othello. The species annotation and abundance information for each sample were counted, and a species abundance information table obtained in Fig.  2 . Among the classifiable sequences in different groups, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were represented the dominant lineages in the samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated.  24  Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\n\nPaper\nFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis.  20, 25  \n\nDe novo assembly and gene predictions\nOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPredicted ORFs \u2265 300 bp in length from all samples were pooled and combined based on \u226595% identity and 90% read coverage using CD-HIT to reduce the number of redundant genes for downstream assembly.

Many conventional computational methods for identifying N6-methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m6A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m6A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m6A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m6A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, an online prediction web server implementing the four proposed predictors has been built and is available at http://server.malab.cn/Gene2vec/. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2015a) , which suggested that sequence signaling is very important for m 6 A sites. Recently, a novel, singlebase-resolution technique, miCLIP-seq  (Ke et al. 2015; Linder et al. 2015) , was also established, which prompted a new wave of research on computational methods of m 6 A identification  (Xiang et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2016) . Notably, m 6 A sites have methylation-specific surroundings, with the topology of a DRACH (where D = A, G, or U; R = A or G; and H = A, C, or U) consensus motif and a GAC consensus motif localized near stop codons, in 3 \u2032 -UTRs, within long internal exons, and at 5 \u2032 -UTRs  (Meyer et al. 2012; Schwartz et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2016) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOther improved works in terms of prediction accuracy on the two data sets were also presented  (Chen et al. 2017b; Xing et al. 2017) . Recently, Zhou et al. established an m 6 A data set from published single-nucleotideresolution maps of human and mouse m 6 A sites  (Ke et al. 2015; Linder et al. 2015) . They then developed an m 6 A predictor named SRAMP  (Zhou et al. 2016) , which simply uses three sequence-derived features with Random Forest classifiers. Following this work,  Xiang et al. (2016)  improved the predictive performance by integrating multiple sequence features, including positional binary nucleotide sequence encoding, nucleotide pair spectrum encoding, positionspecific encoding, and k-mer nucleotide frequency encoding. These methods were used with conventional features in position and frequency statistics, with the sliding window being limited to a narrow region and focusing on only a single species. Additionally, there was a lack of independent testing, which resulted in overfitting.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n, 2018;; He et al. 2018) . However, in this context, there is a major problem regarding construction of the training data set. Specifically, low-quality negative samples cause low generalizability of the model, resulting in poor performance when applied to novel data. In addition, the compatibility of prediction methods in different species also remains a problem, so researchers cannot currently be certain that cross-species predictions are accurate. The yeast data set  (Schwartz et al. 2013)  and Arabidopsis data set  (Luo et al. 2014)  are two benchmark data sets for the computational prediction of m 6 A. Focusing on the Arabidopsis data set, Chen and coworkers first proposed a support vector machine-based method to identify m 6 A sites. Soon afterwards, they proposed a predictor called \"iRNA-Methyl\"  (Chen et al. 2015b ) on a near singlenucleotide resolution yeast data set. Chen and coworkers represented RNA sequences using \"pseudo-dinucleotide composition,\" which focuses on the physiochemical properties of RNA.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Some species are of medicinal importance while some are well known weeds. In arid and semi-arid regions, E. cicutarium has had some importance as a forage plant and is an important grazing plant and source of protein supplements to straw for ruminants in semi deserts and wastelands of the Middle East.

PCoA plot of populations based on morphological characters was in agreement with MDS plot of molecular data. These results indicated that geographical populations of E. cicutarium are well differentiated both in genetic content as well as morphological characteristics. Consensus tree based on morphological and genetic data separated some of these populations from the others suggesting the existence of ecotypes within this species. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAccording to ALI ESMAIL AL-SNAFI  (2017)  showed that Erodium cicutarium contained Tannin, catechins, gallic and elagic acids, sugars (glucose, galactose, fructose), amino acids (glycine, alanine, proline, histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, glutamic acid), vitamins K and C, and wide range of essential and volatile oils. Chromosome counts of 2n=20, 36, 40, 48, and 54 have been reported for the species. The most commonly reported counts from western Europe and non-native areas, where the species has become naturalized, have been n=10, 20; 2n=20, 40 (e.g.  WARBURG, 1938; HEISER and WHITAKER 1948; LARSEN, 1958) . The flowers of E. cicutarium subsp.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1986; HULTE\u00b4N and FRIES, 1986) . Although the species requires moisture from rainfall or irrigation for optimal germination, established plants are drought tolerant and can survive periodic arid conditions  (BLACKSHAW and HARKER, 1998a; BUSSO et al., 1998; BROOKS and BERRY, 2006) . In arid and semi-arid regions, E. cicutarium has had some importance as a forage plant on ranges in California and Arizona  (ANONYMOUS, 1939; BUSSO et al. 1998; GEORGE et al. 2006) ; and is an important grazing plant and source of protein supplements to straw for ruminants in semi deserts and wastelands of the Middle East  (AL-MASRI, 2007) . In Turkey, the species is gathered as a food plant in the Aegean region  (BILGIR, 1982) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMoreover, due to extensive morphological variability of this species in the country, there is possibility of having infra-specific taxonomic forms in this species. Therefore, we carried out population genetic analysis and morphometric study of 15 geographical populations for the first time in the country. Different methods of DNA fingerprinting have proved to be a useful tool with a wide range of applications in plant population studies, such as detection of genetic variation within and between populations, characterization of clones, analysis of breeding systems, and analysis of ecogeographical variation  (DAHLGREN, 1980) . For genetic study, we used the inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) method that displays insertional polymorphisms by amplifying the segments of DNA between two retrotransposons. It has been used in numerous studies of genetic diversity  (SMYKAL et al., 2011) .\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nPlant materials\nA total of 102 individuals were sampled representing 15 natural populations of E. cicutarium in East Azerbaijan, Lorestan, Kermanshah, Gilan and Ardabil Provinces of Iran during July-Agust 2018 (Table  1 ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The nondigestible plant polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Polysaccharides, the predominant functional composition found in jujube fruit, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in polysaccharides preventing carcinogenesis are still uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of jujube polysaccharides (JP) on intestinal microbiota, and the influence of JP on the gut flora structure was then analyzed using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis cancer mouse model, using high-throughput sequencing. Contrasted with control group, the addition of JP could ward off colon cancer by ameliorating colitis cancer-induced gut dysbiosis. In addition, there was a significant decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes post JP treatment. What's more, KEGG pathways of metabolic pathways, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and two-component system enriched the most differentially expressed genes after JP intervention for 13 weeks. These results suggested that JP showed prebiotic-like activities by positively modulating intestinal microbiota and affecting certain metabolic pathways contributing to host health. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of JP to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of jujube polysaccharides as promising prebiotic candidates for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n20  \n\nInfluence of JP on bacterial diversity\nThe high-quality clean reads were >98.50% for all six samples, indicating a good sequencing depth for fecal microbiota gene analysis (Table  S1  \u2020). The flat curves of the base sequence and mass distribution demonstrated higher accuracy (Fig.  S1a \u2020 ). Using MEGAHIT software to assemble effective reads, the default length of KMER should be 21, 41, 61, 81, 99, and the length of contigs could exceed 600 in each group when the sum value reaches 90% of the total length of fragment (Table  S2  \u2020). Using the ReefSeq database in NCBI, fecal microbial genes were indexed and the species annotated using Meta-Othello. The species annotation and abundance information for each sample were counted, and a species abundance information table obtained in Fig.  2 . Among the classifiable sequences in different groups, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were represented the dominant lineages in the samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution using the Agilent-2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of indexcoded samples was performed on a c-Bot Cluster Generation System according to manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated.  24  Quality trimming is an essential step to generate high confidence of variant calling. Raw reads were processed to generate high quality clean reads according to four stringent filtering standards: (i) removing reads with \u226510% unidentified nucleo-\n\nPaper\nFood & Function tides; (ii) removing reads with >50% bases having low quality scores of \u226420; and (iii) removing reads aligned to the barcode adapter. The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using CD-HIT software. The OTUs that reached a 97% nucleotide similarity level were used for further analysis.  20, 25  \n\nDe novo assembly and gene predictions\nOpen Reading Frame (ORFs) were predicted based on final assembly contigs using MetaGeneMark.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nPredicted ORFs \u2265 300 bp in length from all samples were pooled and combined based on \u226595% identity and 90% read coverage using CD-HIT to reduce the number of redundant genes for downstream assembly. The reads were re-arrayed to predict genes using BWA to count reads numbers. Finally, gene catalogues were obtained from non-redundant genes with gene reads counts >2. 30,31\n\nTaxonomical assignment and functional classification\nAfter read filtering, clean reads were used to generate taxonomic profiles using a k-Mer-based taxonomic classifier. This approach employs a novel data structure called l-Othello, which supports efficient querying of taxonomic information from NCBI, using reads k-Mer signatures of 31 bp in length.

The phase, photocatalytic hydrogen production, microstructure, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the fabricated photocatalysts were investigated. BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst has a larger ability for the hydrogen production in photocatalysis process than that of BiFeO3. The reason of the higher photocatalytic activity of BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalyst was revealed by the measurements of UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photocurrent curves and electrochemical impedance spectra. Moreover, the magnetic properties of BiFeO3 and BiFeO3:Gd3+ photocatalysts were also investigated to show the easy separation. These results in current work indicate that BiFeO3:Gd3+ is an excellent photocatalyst and has potential applications in photocatalytic hydrogen production. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nExcept for TiO 2 , various types of photocatalysts were reported in these years, such as titanate  [7, 8] , AM 2 O 4 (A = Cu and Zn, M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co)  [9, 10] , tantalite (niobate)  [11, 12] , sulphide  [13, 14] , ferrite  [15, 16]  and some oxide semiconductor  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . BiFeO 3 is a perovskite-type multiferroic compound, which shows potential applications in spintronics devices due to its high ferroelectric and magnetic phase transitions, as well as large remanent polarization at room temperature  [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, it shows excellently photovoltaic effect and photocatalytic activity because that it can absorb a wide range of sunlight corresponding to its small E g  [26] [27] [28] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor the applications in the photocatalyst field, one of advantages of BiFeO 3 is its excellently magnetic property. It is known that the separation of photocatalysts is essential after the photocatalytic process. Generally, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation are widely used in the separation process although they are complex and expensive  [29, 30] . But the separation process will be easy if the photocatalyst has the magnetism. It means that the photocatalyst can be separated easily by applying an exterior magnetic field. There are some reports for BiFeO 3 in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water  [27, 28, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] ]. Chen's work shows that the hydrothermally-synthesized BiFeO 3 nanocrystals have excellently photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation under visible light irradiation and the surface oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic activity effectively  [37] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction\nIn recent years, sustainable energy is paid more and more attention due to its characteristics of economy, environmental friendliness and social benefits  [1, 2] .

Nonetheless, its relatively long crystallization time and harsh synthesis conditions have strongly obstructed the enhancement of HP-MOFs space\u2013time yields (STYs) and the decrease in energy consumption. Herein, a simple and versatile method for preparing various HP-MOFs at room temperature was demonstrated, which had introduced surfactant as the template, whereas zinc oxide (ZnO) has been used as an accelerant. The resulting HP-MOFs showed multimodal hierarchical porous structures and excellent thermal stability. More importantly, the synthesis time was reduced dramatically to 11 min, with a maximal HP-MOFs STY of as high as 2575 kg m\u22123 d\u22121. Furthermore, the rapid formation process of HP-MOFs was examined through quantum chemistry calculation, and a feasible synthesis mechanism was also proposed. Notably, our synthesis strategy had shown a versatility, since other surfactants could also be used as the templates for the rapid room-temperature fabrication of diverse stable HP-MOFs. Importantly, the porosity of the HP-MOFs could be readily tuned through controlling the type of template. Moreover, gas adsorption measurement of HP-MOFs revealed high CH4 uptake capacity at 298 K due to the increase in surface area and pore volume. Our findings suggest that such method is applicable for the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of HP-MOFs on an industrial scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), self-assembled from metal ions (or metal clusters) and organic ligands, have attracted considerable attention during the last two decades owing to their fascinating physical and chemical properties, such as high specific surface areas, tunable structures and porosities, as well as designable functionality  [1] . Therefore, MOFs, which serve as the functional materials, have exhibited huge potential applications in diverse areas  [2, 3] , including gas storage  [4] , adsorption/separation  [5] , supercapacitor  [6] , drug delivery  [7] , sensing  [8]  and catalysis  [9] . Notably, porosity is an essential feature in MOFs, which plays a vital role in functionalization like the diffusion and mass transfer of substrates/products  [10, 11] . However, the pore sizes of the majority of MOFs have been reported to be within a micropore range (pore size \\ 2 nm) during the last few decades  [4, 12, 13] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBesides, a couple of new methods are also available, such as ionic liquids assisted synthesis  [22] , modulator-induced-defect-formation  [23]  and a spray-drying technology  [24] . Typically, HP-MOFs synthesized by these methods are characterized by the superiorities of tunable mesoporosity and abundant active sites  [25] . However, these approaches mostly require harsh experimental conditions and tedious downstream treatments (such as a long reaction time at high temperature and pressure and/or special apparatus)  [26, 27] , which is energy-consuming and may lead to pollution, a risk of explosion and a low production rate  [28] [29] [30] . For instance, the space-time yields (STYs, kg m -3 d -1 ) are usually below 300 kg m -3 d -1 for products synthesized within several hours  [28] . Recently, Huo groups reported the room-temperature synthesis of HP-MOFs (HKUST-1) with a high STY (2035 kg m -3 d -1 ) by controlling either the synthesis time or the copper source, for the first time  [31] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nConsequently, the primary application of MOFs has focused on small molecules, which has prevented the large molecules to approach or leave the interior active sites owing to the confinement of pore size  [14] . In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to develop efficient methods to synthesize hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) containing micropores and mesopores (or micropores, mesopores and macropores)  [15] . Specifically, the increased length of the bridging ligands is an apparent approach to obtain large pores in the resulting MOFs  [16] . However, it is inevitably associated with certain difficulties, such as extended ligands synthesis, smaller mesopore size (\\ 10 nm), reduced porosity, interpenetration, disintegration and instability of crystal frameworks  [17, 18] . On the other hand, HP-MOFs can also be synthesized through introducing mesopores and/or macropores into the structures of MOFs via the template strategy  [19, 20]  and post-synthetic modification  [21] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this paper, the parameter analysis method in signal processing and the meaning and characteristics of each parameter are introduced. Then, the waveform analysis method is introduced and the basic theory of wavelet transform and its spectrum analysis in waveform analysis method are mainly analyzed. The comparison between wavelet transform and Fourier transform is made: traditional Fourier transform signal processing methods can only be used to process transient stationary signals, and the transient non-stationary signals cannot be analyzed locally. The wavelet transform can take into account the characteristics of both the time and frequency domains, and it can also reflect the local signal well. Through the analysis of the signals in the process of concrete damage, it is found that the two signal processing methods mentioned above can well characterize the damage evolution of materials and damage precursors. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this regard, scholars from all over the world have carried out studies on waste minimization, multiple utilization and harmlessness from the perspectives of waste management methods  [11] , management mode  [12] , optimization process  [13] , recycling  [14] ,  [15] . Among waste, construction waste is the most important component of construction waste, including broken concrete blocks, bricks and so on  [16] . It is one of the most necessary research to reduce environmental pollution by secondary utilization after crushing. However, construction waste cannot be recycled and reused in a full sense  [17] ,  [18] . When it is damaged to a certain extent, it will not be reused. It can only be treated by landfill or open-air stacking. It is one of the important means to solve the problem at present, including effectively judging the damage degree of construction waste, reducing unnecessary secondary treatment and misjudgement of multiple utilization, and making comprehensive use of valuable components  [19] . As a common waste of construction waste, recycled aggregate concrete aggregate has a lot of research on the development and application all over the world  [20] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBased on this, the acoustic emission waveforms of fatigue crack propagation  [6] ,  [7] , the influence of acoustic emission sensors on the acoustic emission waveforms of fatigue crack propagation of thinwalled aerospace specimens  [8] , and the relationship between crop acoustic emission and disease stress are studied with the abnormal change propagation characteristics captured by the evolution of acoustic emission waveforms  [9] . In recent years, economic development has led to the growth of various types of construction, while the corresponding waste is also increasing. Construction waste, which most seriously affects the environment, has become one of the focuses of research. Secondary pollution is becoming more and more serious due to construction waste increasingly diversified and the impact of construction waste on the environment is permanent and cumulative. Since the 21st century, the amount of urban construction waste has gradually increased, and now it accounts for about 35% of the total amount of urban waste  [10] . For various reasons, most of the construction waste is directly transported to the suburbs without treatment and is disposed of by open-air stacking or landfill, which seriously threatens the safety of the ecological environment.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe recycled aggregate concrete is studied through a lot of experiments. It is found that the recycled aggregate concrete has high crushing index, low density, high porosity, enhanced water absorption, low aggregate strength and weak bonding ability. The shear strength and compressive strength test showed that the recycled aggregate perforated brick material showed obvious brittleness  [14] ,  [21] ,  [22] . By measuring the low modulus of elasticity of recycled coarse aggregate concrete relative to ordinary concrete, Etxeberria et al. analyzed the effect of material sequence in concrete production (made of recycled aggregate) on improving its splitting tensile strength  [23] . To some extent, these studies have played a positive role in the reuse of construction waste. However, in practical application, such as the increase of wall cracks has become the bottleneck of the development of this new construction material.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The concept of a smart city is introduced to improve the quality of city life. Smart cities are being developed to satisfy the need for the safety of its users\u2019 and secure journeys over in the urban scenario by proposing the smart mobility concept. At the same time, Vehicular adhoc network (VANET) comes under the type of mobile adhoc network (MANET), wherever the vehicles are treated as nodes in a network. The application of Big Data technologies to VANET gains useful insight from the massive quantity of operational data to enhance traffic management process like planning, engineering as well as operation. During the real-time processes, the VANET generates large data, and the VANET characteristics are mapped to Big Data attributes. Moreover, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed for routing in vehicular networks over Hadoop Map Reduce standalone distributed framework and over multi-node cluster with 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes. The simulation outcomes ensure that the processing time of the algorithm is significant decreases with a rise in the node count of the Hadoop framework. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn  (ADARAMOLA, 2018) , an investigation study is made to transmit data traffic efficiently in cities in the presence of various challenges. The selected metrics are the packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and routing overhead.\n\nProposed model\nThe examination in VANETs can be employed to enhance the transportation framework, provide chain management, in addition to logistics through estimating numerous parameters about the roadways, vehicles, as well as drivers. The collection of data needs sensors in the roadways as well as vehicles which learns the traffic level, climatic conditions, working of the vehicle, and reaction of drivers to the dynamic conditions. In a million miles of streets, billions of vehicles, as well as driver's data are, gathered in several years, the sheer count of data points is astonishing. It is just at this point, using modern Big Data technologies, i.e., a large amount of data can be investigated in shorter time duration for it to be valuable. Out of this massive selection of data, it is needed to construct adaptive methods to assist transportation organizations to decide on the selection of optimal routes with the best time to delivery, safety, cost, and fuel utilization.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWhen calculating traffic conditions during poor climatic conditions, logistics organization can provide an optimal path which allows best routes for proper time delivery. There is a requirement of creating models that may foresee regardless of whether accidents are probably going to happen due to the nature of street as well as driver reaction, in the long run prompting more secure streets. This research has uncovered various advantages such as high safety, low transportation cost, user-friendly, and predictable material deliverance for producing, that is particularly critical for modern just-in-time manufacturing. An individual application can be employed to create or generate different kinds of data which is established quickly and has to process rapidly. The conventional relational databases cannot handle this massive quantity of data, and there is a requirement of efficient methods to manage it. Hadoop is an open-source environment which processes the high volume of information  (Barlow, 2013) . At the point, when an organization requires saving of large measure of data, they have two choices: use a large machine by additional CPU, RAM, disk space and so forth otherwise discuss with database sellers for better solutions. But, each of the two choices has their issues, and there is a tradeoff over securing a big device.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA Hadoop cluster scales computation capacity, storage capacity as well as I/O bandwidth through the inclusion of commodity servers  (L\u20ac ammel, 2008) .

The tool pin geometry directly affects the generation of heat and the flow of internal materials during the FSW process. The effects of the FSW tool pin angle on heat generation and internal flow have not been quantitatively investigated in detail. In this manuscript, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was implemented to analyze the effects of pin angle on the thermo-mechanical action during the FSW process of AA5058 Al-Mg alloy. Experimental test results validate the thermal outcomes of the used model. The obtained results revealed that, when the pin angle is increased, the heat generation decreases while the mechanical action of the tool increases. The internal heat distribution at a higher pin angle is symmetrical. The higher mechanical action of the tool decreases the viscosity of the internal materials and increases stirring action (materials flow) around the pin. Furthermore, plastic flow near the tool increased stirring action and formed a larger stir zone in the joint area.\n \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this case, it is necessary to solve Navier-Stokes equations  [32] [33] [34] [35] .

The FSW tool had rotational movement, and the interior domain was set to move according to the welding tool speed. The interior domain had the same velocity as the welding tool by the velocity inlet side. The sidewalls, along with the top and bottom, had the same velocity as the velocity of the inlet. The outer plate of the workpiece was set at zero pressure to avoid the reverse flow at the pressure outlet.

One of the main solutions for increasing the available capacity is the predetermined plan for constructing a water circulation system to restore the existing water resources. For this objective, a combination model was conducted based on a stormwater management technique and environment landscape system (ELS) under drought conditions. A hydrological framework was established using the long-term meteorological information in central China to estimate the extreme values of surface water in each stress period. A data analysis system was generated at three meteorological points of the study area and the developed model was incorporated to simulate the behavior of the subsurface flow. Consequently, a growth simulation model was designed according to the soil structure and vegetation canopy cover to formulate a real-time plan for the restoration of ELS. Results showed that the proposed model could improve the water productivity in urban and environment consumptions. Furthermore, technical analysis confirmed the suitability and applicability of the developed plan in cities with water shortages. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPoint of view research papers confirmed the need for a calibration process but the calibration methods were different  (Kleidorfer et    \u0394V \u00bc P \u00fe S i \u00fe G i \u00c0 ETa \u00c0 I \u00c0 S 0 \u00c0 G 0 \u00b1 T (1) where \u0394V \u00bc storage capacity variation; P \u00bc precipitation; S i \u00bc surface water infiltration; G i \u00bc surface water infiltration; ETa \u00bc actual evapotranspiration; I \u00bc infiltration; S 0 \u00bc surface water seepage; G 0 \u00bc surface water seepage; T \u00bc tidal current.

Al-MOF has been extensively characterized using FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, FE-SEM, TG-DTA, and Brunauer \u2013 Emmett \u2013 Teller (BET) techniques. The prepared samples, which included large hexagons and triangular channels, had a pore size of about 20 nm and a surface area of about 1245.2 m2/g, according to the results. The mechanism of the formation of Al-MOF has been proposed based on density functional theory with B3LYP and 6\u201331 G (d,p) as the basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbits (HOMO) to the lowest unusable molecular orbit (LUMO) are also used to discuss chemical reactivity patterns in molecules. Al-MOF has demonstrated anticancer activity against human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines, suggesting that it could be a promising anticancer drug for clinical use. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAn interface can be used to transmit the load  [32]  . As a result, the VESTA software used HOMO-LUMO to determine the most likely mechanism of Al-MOF formation  [33]  . Using the Gauss-09 quantum chemistry package, kinetic and thermochemical data were estimated at the theoretical DFT level  [34]  . Since absolute values of the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of the molecule can be obtained by theoretical calculation, the enthalpy of the reaction and the Gibbs energy of each possible reaction are obtained by using these energy values  [35]  . The CA ineludible C = C, C -H, H -O, and C -O bonds must be taken into account during the interaction with the aluminium precursor. The optimization of appropriate molecules was carried out using the B3LYP theory by the 6-31 G set  [15]  . Gaussian 09 was used to make the estimates  [36]  . All optimized structures of S. hortensis were confirmed to have minimal energy compatibility.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDensity functional theory (DFT)\nDensity functional theory (DFT) (i.e., a ground-state theory used to determine the ground states of a quantum system in order to estimate relevant values, such as ground state energy) is an intriguing and powerful tool  [30]  . The particle density of a system with interacting N particles is used as the original value in DFT instead of the wave function  [31]  . Frontier orbital energy gap is the subtraction of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO). The Frontier orbital energy gap could be used to determine the interaction between different species. Harmonic vibrational waves were calculated using second-order analytical derivatives to confirm the convergence of minimums on the potential surface and to evaluate the zero-vibration contrast energy. As shown in Fig.  2  , in the finitecharge regime at one of the metal/molecule interfaces, the role of non-boundary modes is important, as these channels provide additional channels through which they can be used. An interface can be used to transmit the load  [32]  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe samples were heated upto 700 \u00b0C at the rate of 10 \u00b0C/min.

The desensitization phenomenon is well reproduced in numerical simulation using the JWL EOS and the Lee\u2013Tarver kinetic equation for modeling of the initiation of heterogeneous high explosives with as well as without shock front waves. The analysis of the wave processes occurring during the initiation of the acceptor HE charge has been carried out.

The detonation wave was initiated as a plane wave and propagated from the left to the right boundary of the Eulerian mesh. Boundary conditions on the left, right, and upper boundaries were defined in terms of AUTODYN as \"Flow out.\" The lower boundary was the symmetry axis. The most difficult problem in numerical modeling is selecting the most appropriate model and the equation of state parameters for materials used in the simulation. EOS parameters for inert materials were selected from the standard library with the exception of silicon carbide, for which we have selected a model most closely corresponding to the experimental results of paper  [7] .

Peculiarities of the wave processes in the gap test assemblies that can influence the results of sensitivity measurements have been studied. In particular, it has been established that precursor waves in gap test assemblies can influence the detonation transmission distance.

The experimental assembly is shown in Fig.  1 . Distances for reliable detonation transmission, as well as failure distances for acceptor HE charge initiation through water have been measured without any inert insert and for inserts made of PTFE, copper, and silicon carbide of varying heights. In total, the authors have conducted 27 experiments. Experimental detonation transmission and detonation failure distances are presented in Table  1 . Thus, it has been demonstrated that explosive loading of an acceptor HE charge by a precursor wave through a copper or ceramic insert leads to its significant desensitization.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Although, professional stock analysts and fund managers usually make subjective judgments, based on objective technical indicators, it is difficult for non-professionals to apply this forecasting technique because there are too many complex technical indicators to be considered. Moreover, two drawbacks have been found in many of the past forecasting models: (1) statistical assumptions about variables are required for time series models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), to produce forecasting models of mathematical equations, and these are not easily understood by stock investors; and (2) the rules mined from some artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as neural networks (NN), are not easily realized.\n\nIn order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model, using multi-technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Further, it includes four proposed procedures in the hybrid model to provide efficient rules for forecasting, which are evolved from the extracted rules with high support value, by using the toolset based on rough sets theory (RST): (1) select the essential technical indicators, which are highly related to the future stock price, from the popular indicators based on a correlation matrix; (2) use the cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA) and minimize the entropy principle approach (MEPA) to partition technical indicator value and daily price fluctuation into linguistic values, based on the characteristics of the data distribution; (3) employ a RST algorithm to extract linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset; and (4) utilize genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to get better forecasting accuracy and stock return. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with two types of performance evaluations, accuracy and stock return, and by using a six-year period of the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) as the experiment dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, RST and GAs). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBesides the technical analysis methods, many conventional numeric forecasting models have been proposed by financial researchers, such as Engle's  [17]  autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, Bollerslev's  [6]  generalized ARCH (GARCH) model, Box and Jenkins'  [7]  autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). In recent decades, many researchers have employed another approach to financial forecasting: artificial intelligence algorithms In 1990, Kinoto et al.  [29]  developed a prediction system for the stock market by using a neural network. Nikolopoulos and Fellrath  [32]  combined genetic algorithms (GAs) and a neural network to develop a hybrid expert system for investment decisions. Kim and Han  [27]  proposed a genetic algorithms approach in order to feature discretization and the determination of connection weights for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the stock price index. Huarng and Yu  [25]  applied a backpropagation neural network to establish fuzzy relationships in fuzzy time series for forecasting stock prices.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, genetic algorithms (GAs)  [2, 28]  are an effective and robust method for searching for proper solutions to the problems of very large spaces or dimensions in a variety of applications, and are particularly applicable in solving multiparameter optimization problems. In the stock market, ''unexpected events,\" which will turbulently influence stock price, will sometimes occur. Although RS methods can extract rules effectively from past stock data, the rules to express the ''unexpected events\" have very low support value, and they are usually ignored when forecasting the future. Also, the ''unexpected events\" in the future may not be similar to those of the past. Therefore, to meet the ''unexpected events,\" we use GAs to produce ''mutation rules,\" which are evolved from rules extracted from RS methods, to improve classification accuracy and forecasting profit. Consequently, to deal with the unpredictable variations contained in stock markets, GAs are suggested to refine the extracted rules to enhance forecasting performance. The program of the proposed model can be downloaded on the web page  [52] . 1 Some statistical distributions are presumed as a basis to construct mathematical models, but usually stock data do not follow a specific data distribution.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe rest of this paper is organized, as follows: Section 2 introduces the related works; Section 3 demonstrates the proposed model and algorithm; Section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed model and describes the findings; and Section 5 draws conclusions and proposes recommendations for future research.\n\nRelated works\nThis section reviews related works of technical analysis, cumulative probability distribution approach, minimize entropy principle approach, rough set theory, and genetic algorithms.\n\nTechnical analysis\nTechnical analysis is an attempt to predict future stock price movements by analyzing a past sequence of stock prices  [39] . It relies on charts and looks for particular configurations that are supposed to have predictive value. Analysts focus on investor psychology, which represents common investors' responses to certain price formations and price movements, to analyze the fluctuations of stock market. The price at which investors are willing to buy or sell depends on personal expectation. If investors expect the security price to rise, they will buy it; if investors expect the security price to fall, they will sell it. These simple statements are the cause for a major challenge in setting security prices, because they refer to human expec-tations and attitudes  [39] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Compared with the conventional neural network learning algorithm it overcomes the slow training speed and over-fitting problems. ELM is based on empirical risk minimization theory and its learning process needs only a single iteration. The algorithm avoids multiple iterations and local minimization. It has been used in various fields and applications because of better generalization ability, robustness, and controllability and fast learning rate. In this paper, we make a review of ELM latest research progress about the algorithms, theory and applications.

In particular, EM-ELMs can easily be extended to test some number of random candidates at each step and select the best of them, as SAOCIF does. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the cost of the computation of the optimal output-layer weights in the originally proposed EM-ELMs can be improved if it is replaced by the one included in SAOCIF. In addition, there are still a lot of applications about ELM in other areas. An improved ELM method was proposed for soft sensing modeling by  Chang et al. (2007) . By adding a kind of sorting neurons into the hidden layer of the single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), a new SLFN structure was proposed.

Discriminative feature sets are generated using B2DPCA to ascertain classification accuracy. Other notable contributions of the proposed work include significant improvements in classification rate, up to hundred folds reduction in training time and minimal dependence on the number of prototypes.

It is a process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups, where each group contains objects which are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and different from those of other groups. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data which have anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, bioinformatics, biology, recommendation systems and the clustering of text documents. Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of their convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based globalized search algorithm that uses the principles of the social behavior of swarms. PSO produces better results in complicated and multi-peak problems. This paper presents a literature survey on the PSO algorithm and its variants to clustering high-dimensional data. An attempt is made to provide a guide for the researchers who are working in the area of PSO and high-dimensional data clustering. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMarini and Walczak (2011)  proposed a discrete binary-coded implementation of the PSO algorithm to identify and select variables with a significant clustering tendency. In particular, to cope with the problems that can arise when performing variable selection on data sets with a high number of variables, and to account for the possibility of using the method also for purely exploratory purposes, an unsupervised approach was used, where the fitness was computed based on hierarchical clustering models. The characteristics of the method were shown on two simulated data sets and on a real megavariate data set coming from the analysis of genomic microarrays. They conclude that in all cases, PSO allowed them to explore different subspaces and to discover meaningful structures in the analyzed data. Based on these considerations, it is apparent that the use of PSO can represent a very promising option to deal with the problem of finding groups in a multivariate data set in a relatively straightforward and reliable way. This approach could be very useful to cope with biomarker identification in the fields of genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. Lotfi  Shahreza et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe outcome of the study clearly indicates that the proposed composite model and approach of this neural network clustering based PSO can be used as an attractive means for load characteristics to obtain the global load model for describing the nonlinear characteristics of the electric load. It will automatically produce the If-Then rules, whose premise parameters and consequent parameters are adjusted by using a Back-Propagation algorithm in combination with the least squares method. The simulation results also show the feasibility of the method.  Paterlini and Krink (2006)  introduced two algorithms for numerical optimization, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). DE is clearly and consistently superior compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) for hard clustering problems.  Abraham et al. (2007)  introduced a method for clustering complex and linearly nonseparable datasets, without any prior knowledge of the number of naturally occurring clusters. The proposed method is based on an improved variant of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.  Ahmadi et al (2007)  reported that, when the data set is large and has a high dimension, the time single swarm is incapable of exploring the entire solution space.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2003; Parsons et al. 2004) . Variable selection in clustering has been approached from different perspectives: density-based methods such as  (Agrawal et al. 1998; Chan and Hall 2010; Raftery and Dean 2006) , model-based methods such as  (Pan and Shen 2007; Wang ans Zhu 2008) , and criterion-based methods such as  (Witten and Tibshirani 2010; Raftery and Dean 2006) . Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of the convergence and the sensitivity to initialization values, etc. and they still require much investigation to improve performance and efficiency. Clustering methods such as the K-means algorithm, soft clustering based on mixed models, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering have been developed and have proven to be successful in many real world applications  (Kriegel et al. 2009; Luxburg 2007; Steinbach et al. 2003; Parsons et al. 2004; Zhou and Shi 2011) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It refers to a number of solution approaches that have been employed for CF such as mathematical programming, heuristic and metaheuristic methodologies and artificial intelligence strategies. A comparison and evaluation of all methodologies is attempted and some shortcomings are highlighted. Finally, suggestions for future research are proposed useful for CF researchers. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFinally, some additional components could be included in the future agenda for CF: researchers should focus more on multiple objectives rather than single objectives, the dynamic nature of the CF should be included when more comprehensive models are taken into account reflecting reality; more attention should be given to PSO and ACO as both seem promising methodologies for CF; uncertainty in part/machine utilisation could be studied by employing fuzzy theory; hybrid metaheuristics are powerful tools which should be employed more frequently for complex systems such CF.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt is worth noting that these papers were selected to be included in this review as their contribution towards CF covers a large spectrum of research directions over the last ten years. All papers have been classified based on different methodologies employed such as mathematical programming, heuristics/metaheuristics and artificial intelligence approaches and their contribution discussed. For the purpose of this section a comparison and evaluation of the CF formulations is carried out. Table  1  presents a numbered list of CF reference sources and Table  2  a comparison of these numbered sources based on major criteria. The latter involves major objectives and constraints included, solution approaches employed, maximum size of problem data solved, identification of whether the optimum value or deviation from the optimum solution is provided when largest problem solved and whether methodology has been compared to other existing methodologies and finally implementation tools adopted. Major objectives are identified as minimisation of intercellular movements, machine/load utilisation and numerous cost considerations such as: machine operating cost, machine modification costs, machine (re)configuration cost, subcontracting cost, machine setup cost, inventory holding cost, replacement costs of defective parts.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn order to be able to evaluate those methodologies and obtain overall performance criteria, i.e. applicability, practicability, there is still a need for objectively comparing them on benchmark problems. All CF approaches that have been proposed have been tested with a variety of problem sizes and in some cases compared with existing methodologies. An additional stage which would complement the process of evaluating results would be to use industrial data to test a proposed formulation's stability and ability for reconfiguration when real situations are encountered. The main focus of the CF problem is to group parts into part families and machines into machine cells when certain objective functions are taken into account. In the past, it has been suggested by  Selim et al. (1998) , that to achieve the goal of creating efficient manufacturing cells it is imperative to go beyond just grouping parts and machines by adding workers and tools as third and fourth dimensions to parts and machines respectively to meet industrial specifications. To the best knowledge of the authors the latter has not been examined during the last decade by any CF study, hence more attention should be given to utilising workers and tools.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this problem, the most popular performance measure is the top precision measure, and the most important component of a retrieval system is the similarity function used to compare a query image against a database image. However, up to now, there is no existing similarity learning method proposed to optimize the top precision measure. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel similarity learning method to maximize the top precision measure. We model this problem as a minimization problem with an objective function as the combination of the losses of the relevant images ranked behind the top-ranked irrelevant image, and the squared Frobenius norm of the similarity function parameter. This minimization problem is solved as a quadratic programming problem. The experiments over two benchmark data sets show the advantages of the proposed method over other similarity learning methods when the top precision is used as the performance measure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOur proposed algorithm MTPS exhibits shorter running time than others, except for the OASIS and OMKS, suggesting that MTPS provides a comparably efficient way against the problem, and shows a promising improvement space for the future work.\n\nIV.

The critical novelty of this work is it learns the similarity to maximize the top precision measure over the training set. We model the learning problem as a support top irrelevant database image weighting problem to obtain the optimal similarity function. The experiments over some benchmark databases show its advantages over other similarity learning methods. In the future, we will investigate to use some other similarity function as similarity measure instead of linear function, such as Bayesian network  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] , and also to develop novel algorithms of other machine learning problems and applications besides similarity learning, to maximize top precision measure, such as importance sampling  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] , portfolio choices  [18] ,  [19] , multimedia technology  [20] ,  [21] ,  [22] ,  [23] ,\n\nExcerpt 2: \n( 5 ) Thus the loss function for each (z i , x j ) i,j:yij =1 is, \u2113(z i , x j ; W ) = max 0, max k:y ik =0 s(z i , x k ) -s(z i , x j ) + 1 = max 0, max k:y ik =0 z \u22a4 i W (x k -x j ) + 1 .

INTRODUCTION\nIn the problem of content-based image retrieval, the two basic steps of the content-based image retrieval are image visual feature extraction, and the similarity calculation. Recently, the similarity learning problem has been a hot topic in the field of machine learning. This problem tries to learn a parameterized similarity function from a training set, so that a targeted performance can be optimized  [1] . To evaluate the performance of a retrieval system, common measures for retrieval performance are taken, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the top precision value  [2] ,  [3] ,  [4] . The top precision measure is defined as the portion of the top-ranked relevant images out of all the relevant database images. The top-ranked relevant images are further defined as the database images which are ranked before the first ranked irrelevant database image. Top precision is an important performance measure for retrieval problems, however, all the existing similarity learning methods ignore the performance measures, and the resulted similarity function cannot give an optimal performance measure of top precision.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this paper, we propose a novel image representation method by learning and using kernel classifiers. We firstly train classifiers using the one-against-all rule, then use them classify the candidate images, and finally using the classification responses as the new representations. The Euclidean distance between the classification response vectors are used as the new similarity measure. The experimental results from a large scale image database show that the proposed algorithm can outperform the original feature on image retrieval problem. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus we use the class memberships to construct the new representation of the image. Based on this new presentation, we could gain an accurate retrieval of images from a image database  [12] -  [14] . A kernel classifier is used to measure the membership of an image to a special image class. The number of images in each class is always tremendous, thus the training of kernel classifier may takes a long time  [15] -  [18] . To solve this problem, an efficient algorithm is needed. In this paper, we develope a new iterative algorithm to learn the kernel classifier, which is an efficient fast implementation of support vector machine (SVM)  [19] -  [21] . We try to develop the fast algorithm by using both the stochastic learning strategy  [22] -  [24]  and the support vector approximation technology  [25] ,  [26] . The developed classifier is fast and robust, which makes the learning from a large number of images possible. Because the training images are input into the algorithm one by one, thus it does not takes much memory, and it is also a online algorithm.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe write the objective function in  (3)  as O(\u03b1) = 1 2 \u03b1 2 2 + C 1 N N i=1 (f (x i ), y i ) = 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b1 + C 1 N N i=1 \u03b2 i 1 -y i \u03b1 K(\u2022, x i ) (5) \u03b2 i is defined as \u03b2 i = 1, if 1 -y i \u03b1 K(\u2022, x i ) \u2265 0 0, e l s e (6) We try to use the gradient descent method  [43] -  [45]  to update the classifier parameter \u03b1 in an iterative algorithm. However, for the hinge loss has no close form of derivative with regarding to \u03b1, thus we fix \u03b2 i as the previous one.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhen the training image number N is large, the computational cost could be very expensive. \u03b1 t = \u03b1 t-1 -\u03c4 t \u2202O(\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 \u03b1=\u03b1 t-1 = \u03b1 t-1 -\u03c4 t \u03b1 t-1 -C 1 N N i=1 \u03b2 t-1 i y i K(\u2022, x i ) = 1 -\u03c4 t \u03b1 t-1 -\u03c4 t C 1 N N i=1 \u03b2 t-1 i y i K(\u2022, x i ) (9) 1) Fast updating method: To accelerate the updating procedure, we develop a novel and efficient algorithm for this problem.

To prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve its color change sensitivity, it was immobilized with polyvinyl alcohol and a high-absorbance material. The color of the pH indicator changes from yellow to blue and finally purple to indicate spoilage, which can be easily detected by the naked eye. The asprepared pH indicator exhibited good response to pH changes on the surface of chicken breast meat, and no migration of the dye from the indicator onto the surface of the chicken was observed. This pH indicator exhibits excellent feasibility for real-time, direct-contact monitoring of the freshness and quality of various foods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(Incheon, Korea), and GE Healthcare UK Ltd. (Little Chalfont, UK), respectively. Deionized water was used as the solvent for PVA. A 15 \u03bcm polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was supplied by Soojoung Co., Ltd. (Gwangju, Korea). A highabsorbance pad with a three-layered structure of gauze/supersorbent polymer (polyacrylamide)/gauze was purchased from Yuhan Kimberly Co., Ltd. (Daejeon, Korea). Fabrication of pH indicator First, BCP was immobilized on a filter paper using the absorption method (9) by simply immersing the filter paper in 20 mL BCP/PVA/deionized water solution (0.03 g/10 g/90 mL) for 1 h at ambient temperature. Then, the BCP/PVA/filter paper was dried in an oven at 70 o C for 24 h. The filter paper impregnated with BCP and PVA was then cut to the desired shape and size and placed on the PET film.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs shown in Fig.  1 , the pH indicator in this study was designed as a three-layered structure with a super-absorbent pad, which was used to prevent direct contact of the dye with the chicken breast and to improve the color change sensitivity of BCP. The effectiveness of the pH indicator was examined by attaching it to the surface of chicken breasts stored at 4 and 10 o C. The indicator response was correlated with pH, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) content, bacterial growth, and changes in the surface color of the chicken breast. This color-based pH indicator was successfully prepared and tested for the visual monitoring of the real-time freshness of chicken breast in direct contact mode.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials BCP (dye content 90%) as the dye, 98.0-99.5% hydrolyzed PVA (average molecular weight: 17,500 g/mol) as the binder, and filter paper (Whatman TM Filter Paper No. 42; Whatman plc, Maidstone, UK) as the indicator carrier were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MI, USA), OCI Co., Ltd. (Incheon, Korea), and GE Healthcare UK Ltd.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs expected, the as-prepared pH indicator shows good response to pH change on the surface of the chicken breast and accumulation of VBN species during storage. Furthermore, there are no visual differences in color changes between the samples stored at 4 and 10 o C, i.e., the visual color of the pH indicator changes only according to pH on the surface of the chicken breast. No migration of the dye from the indicator onto the surface of the chicken breast is detected after 10 days of storage. This indicates that the BCP dye is successfully entrapped within the highabsorbance materials and filter paper in our system, and that the asprepared pH indicators do not show migration problems in our product-indicator direct-contact system. The pH-responsive color change of the as-prepared indicator shows excellent response to pH change on the surface of the chicken breast and the VBN contents, which are strongly correlated to the proliferation of spoilage microorganisms. Thus, the quick and direct detection of chicken breast spoilage by the pH indicator attached to its surface is highly feasible using the pH responsive freshness indicator developed in this study.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[26] [27] [28]   The unique shape and easily controlled dimensions (from tens to hundreds of nanometers) of molecular bottlebrushes render them particularly useful as molecular building blocks for generating nanostructured materials by (  1 ) single-molecule manipulation to create well-defined nano-objects, (2) solution self-assembly to produce larger aggregates with different morphologies, and (3) melt self-assembly to fabricate periodic nanomaterials with large domain spacings. In each of these applications, the peculiar properties of bottlebrush copolymers enable the synthesis of previously inaccessible materials in a controlled and predictable fashion. The molecular templating method based on bottlebrush copolymers combines excellent dimensional control of solid templating methods and scalability of self-assembly approaches to provide a robust platform for the construction of 1D nanoobjects with tunable dimensions (Figure  2 ). A molecular bottlebrush can be viewed as a covalently preassembled cylindrical polymer micelle.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNew synthetic methods for the preparation of more sophisticated bottlebrushes can lead to the development of highly compartmentalized nanoparticles that can address ongoing problems in drug delivery, catalysis, and molecular separations.

Core-shell bottlebrush copolymer templates have also been used to generate magnetite  31  and CdSe 32 nanoparticle arrays, and CdSe  33  and silica  34  nanowires. Porous nanostructures can be produced by peripheral crosslinking and subsequent core removal of core-shell bottlebrushes (Figure  2b ). Wooley et al. used molecular brushes with a polyisoprene core and a poly(acrylic acid) shell to generate hollow spherical nanocages.  35  Our group has developed a method for the synthesis of organic nanotubes with wellcontrolled dimensions from multicomponent molecular bottlebrushes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We recognize that MendNano is a dynamic model though many aspects in the publication appear to rely primarily on steady state assumptions. As the authors of MendNano, we are sure that Cohen et al. are more familiar with their model than anyone else. Generalizations on our part may be due to limited space. Second, our statement regarding MendNano\u2019s capabilities was not that the model cannot be used to look at different land uses or water types, but rather that from the published works, we were under the impression that only one\ntype can be considered at a time. We did not consider nor state that dissolution is independent of particle size. Rather that, as a screening tool, we chose to limit the complexity required by introducing particle size distribution not unlike other existing models and most MFA models. This necessitated simplifying the calculations so that the amount of data necessary to run the model was manageable. In addition, we felt that modeling dissolution patterns at the individual particle scale when trying to represent a much larger region would not be efficient.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe dissolution equation was written to focus on the loss of the nanoparticle, which is why C is concentration of nanoparticle and not dissolved ion, so the negative is not a typo. In regard to atmospheric dry deposition, we again elected throughout the model not to incorporate a distribution of particle sizes because nanoFate is meant to be a screening level tool. The referenced equation relies on Stoke\u2019s Law5 and is used in nanoFate to calculate deposition of both ENMs associated with aerosols and individual or small aggregates of ENMs of a specified particle size. Particle radius is therefore accounted for in the calculation of both wet and dry deposition in Rp (particle radius), and as with other models that use this equation, if the particles are of varying sizes, then there will be some variability in the predictions. This equation is a reasonable simplification of a rather complex process, which may be improved when better models of atmospheric deposition (wet and dry) of nanoparticles are developed. The primary reason for not explicitly considering multiple particle sizes is due to a lack of experimental data to parametrize the model with realistic particle size distributions for each environment.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAmong other limitations, the fact that, at the time, we did not have realistic distributions of ENM size at the point of release to the environment made it difficult to include particle size in a screening level model. The goal was to holistically and mechanistically consider the most significant processes without making the model too difficult to use. These simplifications are common in environmental modeling and acceptable if clearly communicated and justified scientifically.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, until recently, few studies have examined associations between physical activity and health in young children. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between physical activity and selected health outcomes in children younger than 6 yr.\nMethods: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies examining the associations between physical activity and adiposity/weight status, bone health, cardiometabolic health, and cognition in children younger than 6 yr.\nResults: Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and served as the basis for this systematic review. For weight status/adiposity, 12 of 15 studies found negative associations between physical activity and one or more measures of the outcome. For bone health, 10 articles based on four studies were identified, and nine studies showed stronger bone in more active children. For cardiometabolic health, three studies were identified and findings were limited and inconsistent. For cognition, two systematic reviews were identified and findings were limited. For all four health outcomes, evidence of dose-response relationships and effect modification by demographic factors was very limited.\nConclusions: There is strong evidence indicating that higher amounts of physical activity are associated with better indicators of bone health and with reduced risk for excessive increases in weight and adiposity in children 3 to 6 yr. Evidence was too limited to support conclusions regarding the effects of physical activity on cardiometabolic health and cognition. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe study designs, methods, and findings of these studies are summarized in Table  2 . Three of the four studies focused on preschool children (baseline ages 3 to 5)  (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35)  and one study focused on infants  (36) . The dose of physical activity was defined and measured differently among the studies and included recreational gymnastics participation (months)  (28) (29) (30) , device-measured daily activity (min)  (31) (32) (33) (34) , and bone-strengthening physical activity (sessions)  (27, 35, 36) . All studies used state-of-the-art imaging (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)) to measure bone outcomes and appropriate statistical modeling to control for growth. All studies examining children ages 3-5 years showed statistically significant stronger bone in the more active children. The benefit differences were greater than expected via measurement error and large enough (almost always >3%) to indicate meaningful biological improvements.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAll of the studies included in this review employed prospective, longitudinal study designs. However, methods for measurement of physical activity were highly variable. Also, the studies were quite variable in terms of children's age range, years of follow-up, measurement of weight-related outcomes, and analytic procedures. Not withstanding these differences, the studies were consistent in reporting that higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower levels of weight and/or adiposity in younger children. Twelve of the 15 studies found negative associations between physical activity and weight and/or adiposity  (12-16, 18, 20-25) . While these studies were consistent in observing benefit with higher amounts of physical activity, limitations in study design and variability in methodologies across the studies precluded identifying a particular dose of physical activity that was needed to provide benefits.\n\nBone health.\nThe literature search provided eight papers, with two additional papers added by committee members. These 10 papers represented four studies, two of which had prospective longitudinal study designs and two of which were randomized controlled trials  (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, similar to the evidence for body weight and adiposity, the differences in physical activity measures prevented the assignment of a specific dose of physical activity needed for bone health benefits.\n\nCardiometabolic health.\nVery few studies have examined the association between physical activity and indicators of cardiometabolic health in children younger than age 6 years. The literature search resulted in the identification of three prospective cohort studies that included outcomes related to serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, respiratory symptoms, and blood pressure  (37) (38) (39) . One study reported that physical activity appeared to have an indirect association with blood lipids and lipoproteins in 3-4 year old children, through its relationship with lower levels of body fatness and higher levels of fitness  (37) ; while another study reported an inverse association between physical activity and diastolic blood pressure in 5-7 year-old children  (39) . A final study reported that physical activity at 2 years of age was not related to respiratory symptoms such as wheezing or shortness of breath at 3-4 years of age  (38) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

One of the many fundamental mathematical discoveries of Ostrowski  [1]  is the following classical integral inequality associated with the differentiable mappings: is the best possible. Ostrowski inequality has applications in quadrature, probability and optimization theory, stochastic, statistics, information, and integral operator theory. During the past few years, a number of scientists have focused on Ostrowski-type inequalities for function of bounded variation, see, for example,  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ,  [12, pp. 468-484] . Until now, a large number of research papers and books have been written on Ostrowski inequalities and their numerous applications. On the other hand, many studies have recently been carried out in the field of q-analysis, starting with Euler due to a high demand for mathematics that models quantum computing q-calculus appeared as a connection between mathematics and physics.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn 2013, Tariboon and Ntouyas introduced the D q a -difference operator  [20] . Recently, in 2020,  Bermudo et al.  introduced the notion of D q b derivative and integral  [21] . Many well-known integral inequalities such as H\u00f6lder inequality, Hermite-Hadamard inequalities, Ostrowski inequality, Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality, Gruss inequality, Gruss-Ceby\u0161ev inequality, and other integral inequalities have been studied in the setup of q-calculus using the concept of classical convexity.

One way to achieve a sustainable future in urban areas and remote communities is to use the independent renewable energy systems. Meanwhile, solar energy is one of the most common sources of energy generation that has attracted of the world. The present study provides the comprehensive examine the performance of two parabolic dish collector and flat-plate collector from energy, exergy, Enviroeconomic and Exergoenviroeconomic view of points. To examine the performance of solar systems, the climatic conditions of two different cities in Asia (Beijing and Tehran) have been used. In addition, the performance of the systems is investigated under different parameters and using different working fluids and MWCNT nanoparticle. It was found that the both solar systems have better overall performance in Tehran than in Beijing. Moreover, in the months when the solar collector has lower exergy efficiency, its use in Tehran compared to that Beijing has a better exergy performance than other months. In addition, the lowest and highest Levelized Cost of Energy are belong to dish collector (in Tehran with water) and flat plate collector (in Beijing with Dowtherm Q), respectively. For Tehran, LCOE of dish collector increases more than 5.5-fold when using water/MWCNT nanofluid instead of water. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMWCNT has extraordinary thermal properties and can be widely used industrially and commercially as a new generation of refrigerants and thermal operating fluids. The use of these nanofluids in thermal systems can increase the efficiency and significantly increase the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient in equal Reynolds. This group of nanofluids in different base fluids such as ethylene glycol and water with suitable stability can be provided. The physical properties of the nanofluid should be determined based on the nanoparticle and base fluid physical properties. These properties include viscosity, density, thermal conductivity and specific heat  Ehyaei et al. (2019) . The physical properties of nanofluids can be obtained using the following equations  (Khanjari et al. 2016; Loni et al. 2017; Zadeh et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn addition, the impact of the use of nanofluids on the performance of systems is investigated. Dowtherm Q is a synthetic organic HTF containing a mixture of alkylated aromatics and diphenylethane. Compared to hot oils, it represents better thermal consistency and significantly better low-temperature pump ability.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy testing the system performance with different fluid and nanofluid, they showed that the performance of the system improved by 6.8% when using nanofluid. In addition, the average annual capacity of storage system was 4kWh/day. A similar study was performed by  Tong et al. (2019)  with various nanofluids. The results showed that the exergy and energy performance of the FPC system improved by 57% and 20%, respectively, when Al 2 O 3 nanofluid was used.  Pavlovic et al. (2018)  examined the performance of PDC system by different nanofluids and corrugated and smooth spiral absorber. They concluded that the best performance of the system is achieved when thermal oil is used as the base fluid and copper as the nanoparticle. In a similar study,  Loni et al.

Both positive social interactions and stress are known to induce OXT secretion, but the relative influence of either of these triggers is not well delineated. Choir singing is an activity known to improve mood and to induce feelings of social closeness, and may therefore be used to investigate the effects of positive social experiences on OXT system activity. We quantified mood and salivary OXT and cortisol (CORT) concentrations before, during, and after both choir and solo singing performed in a randomized order in the same participants (repeated measures). Happiness was increased, and worry and sadness as well as salivary CORT concentrations were reduced, after both choir and solo singing. Surprisingly, salivary OXT concentrations were significantly reduced after choir singing, but did not change in response to solo singing. Salivary OXT concentrations showed high intra-individual stability, whereas salivary CORT concentrations fluctuated between days within participants. The present data indicate that the social experience of choir singing does not induce peripheral OXT secretion, as indicated by unchanged salivary OXT levels. Rather, the reduction of stress/arousal experienced during choir singing may lead to an inhibition of peripheral OXT secretion. These data are important for the interpretation of future reports on salivary OXT concentrations, and emphasize the need to strictly control for stress/arousal when designing similar experiments. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis hypothesis was based on two lines of reasoning: (i) an earlier study reporting an increase in salivary OXT concentrations (139% of basal) after 30 min of choir rehearsal, including 10 min of warm-up exercises and repeatedly singing the pop-song ''California Dreaming''  (Kreutz, 2014) ; and (ii) reports of other positive social experiences resulting in OXT secretion, such as intense parent-child interactions, massage, gossiping with friends, and loving interactions between participants and their dogs  (Grewen et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2006; Feldman et al., 2010; Beetz et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Tsuji et al., 2015; Krause et al., 2016; Lebowitz et al., 2016; Brondino et al., 2017) . Of course, it may be that positive bilateral interactions or the powerful intimate bond between parents and their children, romantic partners, or dogs and their owners are needed to trigger the OXT system to a quantifiable extent-aspects that are missing from choir singing.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOXT has been proposed to represent the biological link between the intense social experience of choir singing and its positive psychosocial effects  (Chanda and Levitin, 2013; Kreutz, 2014) . However, previous studies reported inconsistent results, i.e., increased or decreased salivary OXT concentrations  (Kreutz, 2014; Fancourt et al., 2016)  and stable plasma OXT levels  (Keeler et al., 2015)  in response to choir singing. Similarly, some studies found that choir singing resulted in reduced activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as reflected by lower levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and CORT in plasma  (Beck et al., 2000; Keeler et al., 2015)  and saliva  (Fancourt et al., 2016) , whereas others could not confirm this in saliva samples  (Kreutz et al., 2004; Kreutz, 2014) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is possible that increases or decreases in stress/arousal, rather than social experience, drives salivary OXT concentrations. In other words, singing may cause an increase (or a decrease) in stress signals from the brain stem and/or amygdala to the hypothalamus, resulting in the activation (or quiescence) of the HPA axis and the OXT system. If this is true, it can be expected that CORT responses resemble OXT responses to singing. This was indeed the case in previous studies:  Kreutz (2014)  reported an increase in both OXT and CORT concentrations after choir singing (but note that the reported CORT values were supraphysiologically high), whereas  Fancourt et al.

While this process is critical to all multicellular organisms, the proteins that form gap junction channels are not conserved. Vertebrate gap junctions are formed by connexins, while invertebrate gap junctions are formed by innexins. Interestingly, vertebrates and lower chordates contain innexin homologs, the pannexins, which also form channels, but rarely (if ever) make intercellular channels. While the connexin and the innexin/pannexin polypeptides do not share significant sequence similarity, all three of these protein families share a similar membrane topology and some similarities in quaternary structure. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Gap Junction Proteins edited by Jean Claude Herve. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe connexins form a closely related family exhibiting extensive amino acid identity and similarity within their transmembrane and extracellular domains. The similarities in their extracellular loops can be described by two connexin signatures (PS00407 and PS00408,  http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00341 ). Differences and similarities in the connexin sequences have been used to define connexin subfamilies  [7, 30] , and sequence comparisons between different species have been used to identify orthologs  [18] . Currently, five connexin subfamilies are recognized (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5 or GJA, GJB, GJC, GJD, and GJE) (Table  1 ). A wide range of genetic diseases have been mapped to mutations of the connexin encoding genes (including deafness, neuropathies, cataracts, skeletal abnormalities, and skin diseases) (reviewed in  [9, 31, 37, 38, 46, 48, 53, 55] ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMembrane topology of a connexin/innexin/pannexin.

The connexins, innexins and pannexins contain an invariant proline residue in the second transmembrane domain. This proline forms part of a motif (PXXXW) that is conserved between vertebrate pannexins and most innexins. The connexins, innexins, and pannexins are all multi-member families; within the families, sequence differences between members confer unique channel and regulatory properties. Both connexins and pannexins participate in several processes including propagation of calcium waves, inflammation, memory consolidation and neurodegeneration. Knowledge of the sequences and structures of the connexins, pannexins, and innexins is facilitating elucidation of their individual, shared, and complementary roles in physiology and pathophysiology.

In this study, we investigated the role of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel-mediated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in purinergic-mediated disassembly of adherens and tight junction complexes in early tubular injury.\nMethods: Human primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTECs) and clonal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were treated with Transforming Growth Factor Beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) \u00b1 apyrase, or ATP\u03b3S for 48 h. For inhibitor studies, cells were co-incubated with Cx43 mimetic Peptide 5, or purinergic receptor antagonists Suramin, A438079 or A804598. Immunoblotting, single-cell force spectroscopy and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assessed protein expression, cell-cell adhesion and paracellular permeability. Carboxyfluorescein uptake and biosensing measured hemichannel activity and real-time ATP release, whilst a heterozygous Cx43+/- mouse model with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) assessed the role of Cx43 in vivo.\nResults: Immunohistochemistry of biopsy material from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed increased expression of purinergic receptor P2X7. TGF-\u03b21 increased Cx43 mediated hemichannel activity and ATP release in hPTECs and HK2 cells. The cytokine reduced maximum unbinding forces and reduced cell-cell adhesion, which translated to increased paracellular permeability. Changes were reversed when cells were co-incubated with either Peptide 5 or P2-purinoceptor inhibitors. Cx43+/- mice did not exhibit protein changes associated with early tubular injury in a UUO model of fibrosis.\nConclusion: Data suggest that Cx43 mediated ATP release represents an initial trigger in early tubular injury via its actions on the adherens and tight junction complex. Since Cx43 is highly expressed in nephropathy, it represents a novel target for intervention of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CKD. Video Abstract In proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), tight junction proteins, including zona occuludens-1 (ZO-1), contribute to epithelial integrity, whilst the adherens junction protein epithelial (E)-cadherin (ECAD) maintains cell-cell coupling, facilitating connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and the direct transfer of small molecules and ions between cells. In disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) binds to its receptor and recruits SMAD2/3 signalling ahead of changes in gene transcription and up-regulation of Cx43-mediated hemichannels (HC). Uncoupled hemichannels permit the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in to the extracellular space (\u2191[ATP]e), where ATP binds to the P2X7 purinoreceptor and activates the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inflammation results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibrosis and tubular injury. A major consequence is further loss of ECAD and reduced stickiness between cells, which can be functionally measured as a decrease in the maximum unbinding force needed to uncouple two adherent cells (Fmax). Loss of ECAD feeds forward to further lessen cell-cell coupling exacerbating the switch from GJIC to HC-mediated release of ATP. Reduction in ZO-1 impedes tight junction effectiveness and decreases trans-epithelial resistance (\u2193TER), resulting in increased paracellular permeability. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPeptide 5 is a 12 amino acid peptide which targets the 2nd extracellular loop of Cx43  [52] , it has been proven successful in blocking Cx43 hemichannels when delivered topically, intraocularly  [53] , into cerbebrospinal fluid and systemically  [52] . Multiple approaches have been used to confirm target applicability and specificity and all have yielded similar and significant benefits across different injury models. The ability of Peptide 5 to block hemichannel activity, ATP-release and ultimately disassembly of the adherens/tight junction complex in our model system, was assessed by carboxyfluorescein dye uptake, ATP-biosensing and Fig.  8  Cx43 +/-mice exhibit minimal disassembly of the adherens and tight junction complex. Quantification of immunohistochemical staining determined an increase in N-cadherin (a & c) and decrease in ZO-1 (b & d) expression in wildtype (WT) UUO compared to WT sham controls. In Cx43 +/-(UUO) mice, expression of both markers was partially restored to near basal levels.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHuman renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were incubated with TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/mL) \u00b1 Peptide 5 (25 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Co-incubation of hPTECs with TGF-\u03b21 and Peptide 5 restored ECAD expression (Fig.  7a ) from 31.5 \u00b1 9.2% to 108.9 \u00b1 17.1%; NCAD expression (Fig.  7b ) from 280.5 \u00b1 16.7% to 154.7 \u00b1 10.6%; Claudin-2 expression (Fig.  7c ) 65.3 \u00b1 5.4% to 100.9 \u00b1 10% and finally ZO-1 expression (Fig.  7c ) from 59.63 \u00b1 3.1% to 91.6 \u00b1 12.8% as compared to low-glucose control.

Dye uptake increased in TGF-\u03b21-treated HK2 cells to 609.4 \u00b1 46% compared to unstimulated control (Fig.  6a  & b ), whilst co-incubation with Peptide 5 reduced uptake to 163 \u00b1 10.2%. Co-incubation with scrambled peptide failed to blunt the TGF-\u03b21 response (671.5 \u00b1 29.5%, Fig.  6a  & b ).

This family of membrane proteins is the molecular constituent of gap junction channels and hemichannels that provide pathways for direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm and inside-out exchange, respectively. Both types of Cx channels are permeable to ions and small signaling molecules allowing astrocytes to establish dynamic interactions with neurons. So far, most pharmacological approaches currently available do not distinguish between these two channel functions, stressing the need to develop new specific molecular tools. In astrocytes two major Cxs are expressed, Cx43 and Cx30, and there is now evidence indicating that at least Cx43 operates as a gap junction channel as well as a hemichannel in these cells. Based on studies in primary cultures as well as in acute hippocampal slices, we report here that Gap19, a nonapeptide derived from the cytoplasmic loop of Cx43, inhibits astroglial Cx43 hemichannels in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting gap junction channels. This peptide, which not only selectively inhibits hemichannels but is also specific for Cx43, can be delivered in vivo in mice as TAT-Gap19, and displays penetration into the brain parenchyma. As a result, Gap19 combined with other tools opens up new avenues to decipher the role of Cx43 hemichannels in interactions between astrocytes and neurons in physiological as well as pathological situations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPeptides mimicking CL sequences have been frequently used as control peptides for gap junction work, since it was shown that these do not inhibit gap junctional coupling  (Evans and Leybaert, 2007) . Although this specificity has already been reported for the cardiac system  (Wang et al., 2013b)  we think that it is important to validate this property for the nervous system. Indeed, this is particular relevant for the astrocytes because Cx43 hemichannels contribute to \"gliotransmission\" and can thus be involved in neuroglial interactions that participate to the control of neuronal activity and survival (see  Giaume et al., 2013) . In line with this, we found that Gap19 did not inhibit gap junction coupling in astrocytes as measured with dye transfer assays. At the same time, however, Gap19 strongly inhibited Cx43 hemichannels as exemplified by ATP release and dye uptake assays. Finally, we provide evidence that the TAT version of Gap19 is able to cross the intact blood-brain barrier indicating that this peptide can be used to block astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity when applied through a vascular route.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTAT-Gap19 PEPTIDE\nTAT-Gap19 (YGRKKRRQRRR-KQIEIKKFK) was synthesized by Pepnome Inc. (Hongkong, China) at a purity of 95%. It was dissolved in PBS and aliquoted/stored as a stock solution of 10 mM.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS\nThe data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m., with \"n\" denoting the number of independent experiments. Two groups were compared by student's t-test and two-tail p-value. In experiments where the effects of different treatments were assessed on normalized data, non-parametric ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. Tests with significance of p < 0.05 were followed by a Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc test using the GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (San Diego, CA, USA). Unless stated otherwise, significance as compared to control condition based on the raw data (before normalization) was assessed by two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFinally, the effects of Gap19 on hemichannel activity reported here are similar to those previously described for Gap26 and Gap27 that also blocks hemichannel activity in astrocytes induced by LPS or pro-inflammatory treatments in culture astrocytes (see  Retamal et al., 2007; Froger et al., 2010)  and in acute brain slices treated with the amyloid peptide  (Orellana et al., 2011) . have also published that carbenoxolone blocks hemichannel activity induced by a calcium free solution  (Rouach et al., 2008, Supplementary Data Figure S5) . The in vivo injection experiments demonstrate that TAT-Gap19 can be detected in the brain tissue, based on immunostaining for the TAT moiety of the peptide (Figure  4 ). This observation indicates that TAT-Gap19 can successfully cross the blood-brain barrier, which is expected as a result of the presence of the TAT membrane translocation motif. We did not quantify the immune signal in terms of estimates of the concentration attained.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We investigated the ability of injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a preclinical model.\nMethods: Twenty-four inbred Wistar Furth rats were divided into three groups. As a control, Group A underwent sham operation. Group B had sphincterotomy and repair of both anal sphincters plus saline injections. The study group (Group C) underwent sphincterotomy and repair followed by intrasphincteric injections of syngenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. A further group (Group D) of outbred Wistar rats treated with mesenchymal stem cells and immunosuppressive therapy also was evaluated. At 30 days, histologic and morphometric analysis and in vitro contractility testing was performed.\nResults: A significant decrease of muscle tissue was observed at the site of repair after sphincter injury. However, in Groups C and D, histologic examination demonstrated new muscle fibers and morphometric analysis revealed a significantly greater muscle area fraction than in Group B (P < 0.05). Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells injection improved contractility of sphincters strips compared with Group B (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between Groups C and D.\nConclusions: In our experimental model, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells injection improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after injury and repair. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells may represent an attractive tool for treating anal sphincter lesions in humans. Investigations into the biologic basis of this phenomenon should increase our knowledge on underlying mechanisms involved in sphincter repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n42, 43  Thus, additional studies will be necessary in the future to examine and compare different stem cells proposed to anal sphincter repair after injury.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides an experimental basis for potential future clinical application of stem cells therapy for anal sphincter injuries. Stem cells could be injected at the moment of surgical repair or percutaneously by ultrasonographic guide in selected injured areas and improve the regeneration and the healing of damaged anal sphincters. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm and expand our preliminary results before attempting this in the clinical setting.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA nal incontinence is a disabling condition that affects a large number of patients and may have devastating effects on quality of life. \n1, 2  The mechanism of continence is complex and involves many structures and pathways. Disruption of the anal sphincters is one of the most common causes of anal incontinence and may occur as the result of obstetric injury, anorectal surgery, or trauma.  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Sphincter repair is the operation of choice in patients with damaged anal sphincters, and clinical series have reported a relatively good success rate after treatment. However, the initial symptomatic improvement is not always maintained with time and long-term outcome remains unsatisfactory.  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  Many reports have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (MSC) can differentiate into mature cells of many tissues.  15, 16  In particular, injected MSC engraft and form multinucleated myotubes in skeletal muscle under appropriate stimuli, i.e., injury, contributing to muscle regeneration.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[17] [18] [19] [20]  Thus, MSC injection may represent a new attractive treatment option for anal sphincter lesions. Moreover, experimental injury of detrusor muscle and urethral sphincter has been successfully treated with stem cells injection as a potential therapy for urinary incontinence.  [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  To our knowledge, no previous report on the use of stem cells for the treatment of anal incontinence is present in the surgical literature. We developed an experimental rat model of anal sphincters injury treated with primary surgical repair and investigated the contribution of injected MSC on the regeneration and the healing of damaged sphincters using histologic and functional studies.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis study was approved by the local ethics committee and all procedures were conducted in accordance with the European legislation and with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals established by the National Institutes of Health. Twenty-four male inbred Wistar Furth rats (weight range, 250-300 g) from Charles River Laboratories (Lecco, Italy) were used and divided into three groups of eight animals each.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A statistically significantly higher number of these cells was found within the epidermis in necrobiosis lipoidica compared with granuloma annulare and normal skin. The numbers were similar to those seen in sarcoidosis and tuberculous reactions in the skin, which raises the possibility of an immune pathogenesis for necrobiosis lipoidica. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOnly one of our cases had diabetes mellitus. In granuloma annulare the primary event is also thought to be collagen degeneration. Electron microscopy shows degeneration of elastic and collagen fibres in necrobiotic areas.'*^''' Vascular changes are few.\"* A cell-mediated immune reaction has been implicated with the demonstration of increased numbers of T helper/inducer lymphocytes within the granulomatous infiltrate, an increased number of 0KT6 positive Langerhans cells within epidermis and dermis, and increased HLA-DR antigen and interleukin 2 receptor expression.' ^ The increased numbers of S100 positive cells in granuloma annulare lends some support to these findings, but the numbers are higher in necrobiosis Hpoidica and other known type IV delayed hypersensitivity reactions.\"^ In conclusion, an increase in the number of epidermal dendritic Sioo positive cells above the basal layer, as well as implicating a cell mediated immune-reaction, may provide an adjunct to histological means of distinguishing between necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNone of the eight patients with granuloma annulare were known to be diabetic.\n\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough clinically different, the similarity of the histological features of granuloma annulare and necrobiosis lipoidica raises the possibility of a common pathogenesis. We have determined the dendritic S100 protein positive subset of the Langerhans cell population in the epidermis in these two conditions. There was a significantly higher number of Sioo positive dendritic cells within the epidermis, above the basal layer, in necrobiosis lipoidica compared with both normal skin and granuloma annulare. In the latter the numbers of cells were elevated, but not to a significant level above normal. This suggests that the pathogenesis of the two conditions may be different. We have found that the numbers of Sioo positive epidermal dendritic cells are elevated to a similar level to that seen in necrobiosis lipoidica in sarcoidosis, positive Kveim test biopsies, tuberculous leprosy and other tuberculous reactions (unpublished data).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThere was no disparity between the histological and clinical diagnoses in any of the cases. All showed the recognized features of collagen degeneration, some having palisaded granulomas. In the majority, the full thickness of the biopsy that included the tower reticular dermis was involved by the lesions. Dendritic cells were seen positively stained, lying between keratinocytes, within the epidermis (Fig.  i ). There was an increase in numbers of epidermal dendritic Sioo positive cells in both granuloma annulare (mean 80) and necrobiosis lipoidica (mean 24 5), compared with normal skin controls (mean 37) (see Table  i} . The numbers were higher in necrobiosis lipoidica than granuloma annulare (o 001 > P > 0 0005); but there was no statistical difference between granuloma annulare and the control group (015 > P>oio).  Of the seven patients with necrobiosis lipoidica one had diabetes mellitus and the number of SIOO positive dendritic cells within this patient's biopsy was in the same range as the remaining six.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) and other antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were tested for by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. Positive results for Scl 70 antibodies were obtained in 77% of cases of diffuse scleroderma and 44% of acrosclerosis. ACA and Scl 70 antibodies were found to be mutually exclusive. If acrosclerosis cases positive for anticentromere antibodies are excluded, the percentage of acrosclerosis cases positive for Scl 70 was 63%. ACA were found to be a marker of a benign, abortive subset of acrosclerosis with almost no cutaneous involvement (CREST), whereas Scl 70 did not discriminate between acrosclerosis and diffuse scleroderma. On HEp-2 cells Scl 70 positive sera gave a characteristic, fine speckled, almost homogeneous nuclear staining pattern. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDISCUSSION\nScl 70 antibody was found to be a specific serological marker of systemic scleroderma. In our series it was detected at a much higher frequency than reported in previous publications  (Tan et al., 1980; Catoggio et al., 1983) , but comparable results have been reported recently by  Takehara, Moroi and Ishibashi (t985) .

In our series, this gap is filled, in a part, by the RNP and anti-nucleolar antibodies. The value of tests for Scl 70 antibody and ACA may well prove to lie also in their prognostic role, in predicting whether patients with acrosclerosis will, in time, develop into true diffuse scleroderma or remain as cases of acrosclerosis with minimal cutaneous involvement. This is supported by more than 10 years of retrospective study on 16 cases of diffuse scleroderma, diagnosed originally as acrosclerosis, and later as transitional form; 12 of these 16 (75\",,) were positive for Scl 70 antibody. Follow-up studies are needed to determine whether cases of acrosclerosis that are positive for Scl 70 antibodies are at greater risk of developing frank diffuse scleroderma.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis was diluted t: 128 to contain 5 units/ml.\n\nRESULTS\nScl 70 antibody appeared significantly more frequently in diffuse scleroderma (77\",, of patients) than in acrosclerosis (44\",,) {P < 005; Table  i ).

Thus, Scl 70 appears to be highly specific of systemic sclerosis. Patients with acrosclerosis positive for ACA were invariably negative for Scl 70 (Table  3 ). Conversely, patients with acrosclerosis negative for ACA were found to be positive for Scl 70 in 63\"(, cases, whereas in acrosclerosis patients as a whole Scl 70 antibody was present in 44\",, ofthe cases (Table  1 ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These include TGF-\u03b1, a-FGF, b-FGF, PDGF, TGF-\u00df, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, NGF, TNF-ct, ILla, IL-l\u00df, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and MCSF.[citation 24]\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The Biology of Skin Grafts \nAbstract: Background: Skin grafting is commonly used to treat nonhealing wounds. However, how skin grafts help to heal wounds is not entirely known. Why epithelium from grafted skin is able to migrate and cover these wounds, while epithelium at the edge of nonhealing wounds is unable to, is a long unanswered biologic question.\nObservations: The recent use of cultured epithelial allografts has rekindled interest in the biology of skin grafts. Replaced, even in chronic wounds, by recipient epithelium, cultured epithelial allografts appear to work by providing a potent stimulus to healing imparted by the graft itself. Based on this, we have reassessed how skin autografts help to heal wounds and hypothesize that, in a similar fashion, autografts may work not only by replacing tissue but also by providing a stimulus for healing.\nConclusions: We suggest that skin grafts may work not only as tissue replacement but as pharmacologic agents that provide a stimulus for healing. We believe that, someday, it may be possible to augment the stimulatory properties of donor skin to speed healing of the recipient wound. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nToward that end, Beele and coworkers22 were recently successful in treating chronic leg ulcers with repeated cultured epi\u00ac dermal allografts, suggesting that repeated \"doses\" are needed in some patients to aid in wound healing. They noted healing from the edge with each successive graft. It is possible that traditional skin grafting using the patient's own skin without in vitro expansion may work, in part, due to growth factors supplied by the patient's own healthy donor skin. The donor skin transplanted to a nonhealing chronic wound may bring with it factors or the capacity to elaborate factors ab\u00ac sent or deficient in the recipient area. Possibly, the stratum corneum, which is known to act as a reser\u00ac voir,23 or other cells in the grafted tissue, may act as a transport for needed endogenous \"growth factors.\" It is well known that acute wounds produce growth fac\u00ac tors that stimulate healing.24 These factors supplied by the newly grafted skin may significantly contribute to the eventual healing of the wound. In addition, the newly grafted skin may serve to stimulate matrix for\u00ac mation or the release of inflammatory mediators.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, cultured allografts do not ultimately survive transplantation. However, they do seem able to pro\u00ac vide a potent stimulus to healing when placed on a wound. Interestingly, in chronic wounds previously refractory to treatment, the use of cultured kerati- nocyte allografts causes rapid healing even in the face of graft failure. Leigh and coworkers6 felt that host reepithelialization seen after allografting was caused by soluble \"growth factors,\" and this was clinically ap\u00ac parent by \"an effect on the edge of the ulcer which starts to grow in rapidly.\"6 Other authors8,19 have noted this so-called edge effect, and some have also ex\u00ac pressed the idea that the epithelial cells elaborate growth factors responsible for the rapid reepithelial\u00ac ization of the wounds.20,21 If, as it appears, growth fac\u00ac tors are in some way responsible for the rapid healing of chronic ulcers after cultured epithelial allografting, then perhaps \"dosing\" of these growth factors with re- peated grafts may be important.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt appears that the donor tissue is responsible for bringing with it an angiogenesis factor. Grafts taken from highly vascular donor sites heal better than those taken from sites with relatively poor vascular supply, once again suggesting a donor-dependent process.26 Recently, in work done on pigs, whose skin is histologically similar to human skin, Blair and coworkers27 found that using \"diced\" skin grafts were as effective in healing large wounds as mesh grafting.27 This is in\u00ac teresting because, when using \"diced\" grafts, their ori\u00ac entation is lost (ie, epidermis up or down). Similarly, in microskin grafting used in China, orientation of the autografts may be lost without affecting the clinical outcome.28,29 Perhaps donor skin carries with it a \"dose pack\" of factors that are released whether the graft takes or even if it is upside down. Gilmore and Wheeland30 observed that several patients who had partial healing of chronic venous ulc\u00e9rations after a single skin graft healed completely with additional grafting treatments. These results may also be ex\u00ac plained by the \"dose pack\" idea.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The location of the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. relative to the ostium of the celiac trunk was identified on the aortic wall. Following this, the locations of the ostia of the renal aa. on the internal wall of the abdominal aorta were examined relative to the ostia of the arteries mentioned earlier. The ostium of the superior mesenteric a. was usually localized on the inferior-fight side of the ostium of the celiac trunk. The mean value of the distance between the ostia was 17.9 mm. The ostium of the right renal a. was more cranial than the ostium of the left renal a. (53.3%). However, the ostia of both right and left renal aa. were at the same level in three cases (10%). Locations of the ostia of the renal aa. were usually on the lateral and anterolateral regions of the aortic wall. This study was carried out in order to contribute to selective angiography and surgical interventions for the removal and transplantation of organs, particularly of the kidney. Our results are compared with previous similar studies in man.  \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(16%). Bauer and Robbins reported that the ostia of the renal aa. were localized on the lateral and anterolateral walls of the aorta in 79 and 15.4% of cases, respectively  [3] . However, Odman and Ranniger found the incidence of a lateral location of the renal aa. to be 55.7%  [10] . Our findings were more compatible with the findings of Odman and Ranniger, since the incidence of lateral and anterolateral locations were 48.3% and 31.6%, respectively. According to Odman and Ranniger, the ostium of the right renal a. was located more on the anterior wall and that of the left renal a. on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta. These authors also reported that renal aa. originating from the anterior wall had a more cranial position near the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. [ 10]. We found that renal ostia on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta had a cranial, but ostia on the anterolateral wall a caudal position.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis result accounted for the more cranial position of the right renal ostium in relation to the left renal ostium. Extreme (anterior or posterior wall) locations of renal ostia on the aortic wall have been reported to be related to developmental variations of the mesonephric aa.  [2, 5, 7] . Although the distance between the ostia of the superior mesenteric a. and the celiac trunk differed in many cases, locations of the renal ostia did not exhibit significant differences. We believe that, for the success of catheterization in selective angiographic procedures, the following anatomical guidelines should be kept in mind: \u2022 The ostium of the right renal a. is usually located on the lateral wall of the abdominal aorta and has a more cranial position than the left. It is nearer to the superior mesenteric ostium and approximately 14 mm distal to it. \u2022 The location of the ostium of the left renal a. is similar to that of the fight; however its distance from the superior mesenteric ostium is approximately 17.5 mm distal to it.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs shown in Table  1 , the ostium of the right r e n a l a. was c l o s e r to the ostium of the superior mesenteric a. than the left. Thus, the ostium of the right renal a. had a cranial location in 53.3% of cases. However, the ostium of the left renal a. was located cranially in 36.6% of the cases. In the remaining 10%, both renal aa. were at the same level. In order to evaluate the distances of the right and left renal ostia from the superior mesenteric and celiac ostia, a p a r a m e t r i c t w o -s a m p l e analysis test was done. There was no statistically significant difference between Vel r and Vcr r (p > 0,05), however the difference between Vmlr and Vmr r was found to be significant (p < 0,05).

We re-examine a breccia pipe in the Bushveld Complex to investigate the role of volatile fluid overpressure in its emplacement. This 10-m-diameter breccia pipe was emplaced vertically in the anorthosite of the Upper Critical Zone of the Bushveld Complex and contains blocks of Bushveld anorthosite, norite, and pyroxenite, apparently derived from lower in the stratigraphy. The blocks are commonly elongate, and are tightly packed within an ultramafic pegmatite groundmass. Ultramafic pegmatitic dikes radiate bilaterally from the pipe. Microprobe analyses of plagioclase in the breccia pipe blocks reveal that these grains are unzoned and have higher anorthosite content (~An85) than host rock plagioclase (~An75), indicating that the breccia pipe blocks were transported considerable vertical distances. Whole-rock major- and trace-element data show enrichment in fluid-soluble incompatible elements, supporting the role of volatile fluids in the formation of the pipe. A model is examined in which the segregation of a fluid phase from interstitial liquids in the cumulate section below the breccia pipe leads to the development of sufficient overpressure for its explosive emplacement. Fluid overpressure can develop by compaction and during crystallization of plagioclase-saturated silicate liquids as fluids exsolve from the solidifying interstitial liquid. If fluids separate faster than they can escape from the crystal pile, significant overpressures can develop. The minimum fluidization velocity which would be required to emplace blocks of the size and density found within the breccia pipe is found to be 10\u2013110 m/s. The crystallization model predicts the development of about 400 bar of overpressure, an amount calculated to be sufficient for pipe emplacement. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFluid saturation in the interstitial liquid of the crystal pile occurs after volatile concentrations are increased in the liquid as the result of the crystallization of anhydrous phases. The net volume change on crystallization is usually negative  (Peterson 1987) , leading to a net contraction but, when fluids are exsolved and plagioclase crystallizes, the net volume change is positive and a crystallization overpressure develops. This overpressure is in addition to any overpressure from derived compaction in the crystallizing pile. Thus, as seen in Fig.  12 , the base of the chamber comprises solid degassed cumulates, with no porosity. This region is overlain by a region of crystal mush, wherein exsolving fluids migrate upwards along a pressure gradient to a fluid saturation front within the mush zone (crystals and liquid). Overpressure develops beneath the fluid-saturation front, leading to the eventual explosive emplacement of the breccia pipe and the possible release of volatile components back into the main magma chamber.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nBecause the Lower and Critical zones are characterized by modal layering, it is likely that different bulk-rock compositions will have different solidus temperatures -some lithologies will be more permeable to fluid transport than others. Fluids are likely to collect in those rocks which have significant residual porosity. These gas-rich regions may be interconnected via pegmatitic channel ways and fractures. Conversely, rocks with low permeability can act as ''caps'' preventing the escape of fluids. When an escape channel does develop, the fluid escapes violently. The presence of ring fractures suggests the exposed host rock (as with the blocks themselves) was significantly solidified such that the fracturing was not annealed subsequent to pipe formation. This suggests that the fluid-source region was gasrich and silicate-liquid poor.\n\nConclusions\nThis study supports earlier contentions that exsolved fluids can create significant overpressures in a solidifying crystal pile  (Burnham 1979; Boudreau 1992) . Furthermore, we add to the growing body of work supporting the importance of exsolved fluids migrating upwards as they harvest and concentrate any PGE which may be present in layered intrusions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThus, for overpressure to develop, the combined crystallization expansion of plagioclase and exsolution of water is required to overcome the crystallization contraction of the other crystallizing phases. Furthermore, the isochoric P-T plot of fluid-saturated magmas demonstrates that an overpressure of about 400 bar can be generated. Plagioclase-saturated liquids develop overpressures immediately, because plagioclase is the first mineral to crystallize, but less overpressure is developed. The requirement that plagioclase joins the liquidus for crystallization overpressure to develop is significant because the breccia pipe is located stratigraphically about 800 to 1,000 m above where plagioclase first appears as an abundant interstitial mineral: it is a modest but obvious increase in the amount of interstitial plagioclase which marks the base of the Lower Critical Zone. Thus, the model results are consistent with our geochemical data: the plagioclase analyzed from pipe blocks has an average An content which does not disagree with an origin near the base of the Lower Critical Zone.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Because the liver is susceptible to toxin- or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth. Specifically, in response to injury, quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and undergo DNA replication to promote liver regrowth. Despite the elucidation of a number of regenerative factors, the mechanisms by which liver injury triggers hepatocyte proliferation are incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that eosinophils stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and toxin-mediated injury. Liver injury results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to promote the proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Surprisingly, signaling via the IL-4R\u03b1 in macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue repair, is dispensable for hepatocyte proliferation and liver regrowth after injury. Instead, IL-4 exerts its proliferative actions via IL-4R\u03b1 in hepatocytes. Our findings thus provide a unique mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInterestingly, signaling via the IL-4R\u03b1 in myeloid cells is not required for mediating the regenerative actions of type 2 cytokines in injured liver. Rather, type 2 cytokines stimulate liver regeneration, in part, via activation of the IL-4R\u03b1 on hepatocytes.\n\nResults\nEosinophils Are Recruited to the Liver After Hepatic Injury. To identify potential immune cells that participate in liver regeneration, we examined the immune cell repertoire of regenerating livers. Injury induced by partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) led to a dramatic increase in the recruitment of innate immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Figs. S1 A and B, and S2), which coincided with the onset of hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the content of adaptive immune cells did not change significantly in these models of liver injury (Figs. S1 C and D and S2).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, our work has elucidated a direct mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 signals via the hepatocyte IL-4R\u03b1 to stimulate liver regeneration. In broad terms, these findings suggest that activation of type 2 immunity is integrally linked to reparative and regenerative programs in tissues, thereby exemplifying the host's protective strategy of tolerance against tissue damage  (8, 32) . In support of this idea, we recently reported that eosinophil-derived IL-4 facilitates muscle regeneration  (11) . Last, the ability of IL-4 to induce cell cycle progression in hepatocytes and protect against toxin-mediated injury has potential clinical implications for augmenting liver growth and regeneration in patients with liver disease. Our studies differ in a number of important ways from a recent report that demonstrated a role for IL-4 in liver regeneration  (23) . First, using homozygous KN2 mice that lack IL-4 (24), we failed to detect any differences in liver's regenerative response to injury. A substantial defect in liver regeneration was observed in IL-4/IL-13 knockout mice, which suggests that functional redundancy between IL-4 and IL-13 accounts for these discrepant results.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1  E and F and Fig.  S3C ). Moreover, this impaired regenerative response of \u0394dblGATA mice to partial hepatectomy or CCl 4 -mediated injury was associated with complete absence of liver eosinophils (Fig.  S4  A and B). These results highlight a previously unappreciated role for eosinophils in inducing hepatocyte proliferation after injury and implicate eosinophil-derived factors in the orchestration of liver regeneration. Eosinophils Recruited to Injured Liver Secrete IL-4. Among the factors secreted by eosinophils, IL-4 has been implicated in both wound repair and liver regeneration  (8, 12, (19) (20) (21) . We thus evaluated the competence of eosinophils for IL-4 secretion in injured liver. After CCl 4 -induced liver injury, eosinophils, which can be distinguished by their expression of sialic acid-binding Ig receptor (Siglec-F)  (15) , were the predominant cell type competent for IL-4 secretion (Fig.  2A  and Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The Catalog includes 1751 curated publications of 11 912 SNPs. In addition to the SNP-trait association data, the Catalog also publishes a quarterly diagram of all SNP-trait associations mapped to the SNPs' chromosomal locations. The Catalog can be accessed via a tabular web interface, via a dynamic visualization on the human karyotype, as a downloadable tab-delimited file and as an OWL knowledge base. This article presents a number of recent improvements to the Catalog, including novel ways for users to interact with the Catalog and changes to the curation infrastructure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis association between the degenerative disease and inflammation pathways has since been verified in other studies and is now showing promising results as a therapeutic target  (2) .

Unlike single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease, complex diseases are usually the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, each of which increases susceptibility to the condition. In the absence of a single causative variant, GWAS aim to identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with a gene or other regulatory element that might contain a causal variant contributing to a condition's aetiology. GWAS are non-candidate genedriven and use a whole-genome approach in large studies of up to hundreds of thousands of individuals investigating traits such as disease, response to drug and anthropometry  (1) . The importance of GWAS in advancing scientific understanding of disease mechanisms and providing starting points for the development of medical treatments is well established. One of the first GWAS identified a polymorphism in complement factor H, part of complement-mediated inflammation, in a study on age-related macular degeneration.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nthe category 'liver enzyme measurement' has a similar number of traits on the diagram as the much broader category 'cardiovascular disease'. The visualization and ontology in combination allows users to access rich genomic information pertaining to a trait by a simple query for trait name, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, using the hierarchy, e.g. all nervous system disease, and the diagram links to Ensembl for RSIDs, allowing access to genomic context, and population level information.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe present the GWAS Catalog, supporting infrastructure and new query, curatorial and visualization tools. The mapping of complex phenotypic traits to the Experimental Factor Ontology facilitates cross-study comparisons within the Catalog as well as the integration of Catalog data with other resources. It also supports the generation of a semantic web technology-driven interactive visualization of the GWAS Catalog data and offers community access. A number of improvements to data holdings, extraction processes and data access are planned based on recruitment of community feedback.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These include nanobainite steel [citation 36].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: The role of retained austenite on tensile properties of steels with bainitic microstructures \nAbstract: In high-carbon, silicon-rich steels it is possible to obtain a very fine bainitic microstructure by transformation at low temperatures (200\u2013300\u00b0C). This microstructure consists of slender ferrite plates, with thicknesses of several tens of nm, in a matrix of retained austenite. Whereas strength is mainly provided by to the fine scale of the ferrite plates (stronger phase), ductility is mostly controlled by the retained austenite (softer phase). Further improvement in ductility is achieved by strain induced transformation of austenite to martensite, the so called TRIP effect. In order to take full advantage of this effect, the mechanical stability of the austenite, i.e., its capability to transform to martensite under strain, must not be too low nor excessively high.\nTwo main aspects of the mechanical stability of the retained austenite, morphology and chemical composition, have been studied to determine the role that these play on the ductility behaviour of the bainitic steels studied. It is suggested that the chemical composition has the strongest effect on the ductility of these new high strength alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFigure  4  represents the strength vs. total elongation for bainitic steels from the literature  [23] [24] [25]  and for those studied in this work. It can be clearly seen that the tensile properties reported in this work has never before been achieved in bainitic steels. It has been suggested  12)  that in this type of low temperature bainitic microstructures the main strengthening mechanism is intimately related to the very small thickness of the ferrite plates and to its high dislocation density. The former gives the largest contribution, up to 1.6 GPa, while a maximum of 500 MPa is estimated to be provided by the dislocation density.  26)  On the other hand, ductility seems to be controlled by the amount of retained austenite, which is the softest phase present in the microstructure.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRegarding total elongation, significant differences are found between both steels. In alloy 1 increasing the test temperature produces an increase of the total elongation by 17 percentage units, while for the Co-Al alloy the increase is less than 2 percentage units, see Table  4 . Following the evolution of the incremental work hardening in Fig.  9 , it is possible to assure that in both alloys retained austenite becomes more stable when compared with the room temperature experiments. After an initial rapid increase to high n values and subsequent decrease, both alloys exhibit, at about 0.045 of true plastic strain, a minimum prior to a continuous increase. These results confirm that the retained austenite in alloy 2 is indeed mechanically too stable, which inhibits taking full advantage of its beneficial effect on ductility.\n\nConclusions\nHigh-carbon, silicon-rich steels with bainitic microstructures obtained by transformation at very low temperatures (200-300 C) were tested in order to characterise their mechanical properties. The obtained microstructures exhibit an extraordinary combination of tensile properties, which has never before been achieved in bainitic steels.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n17.  because of its higher C concentration, and, moreover, because it contains about 1.01 mass% Al of which alloy 1 lacks, see Table  1 .

Yield strengths (YS) are greater than 1.2 GPa and ultimate tensile strengths (UTS) are ranging from 1.77 to 2.2 GPa.

The microstructures obtained by transformation at 300 C exhibit a total elongation close to 30% for both alloys, very high values when compared with those obtained by transformation at 200 C, where the elongation is reduced to 4.6 and 7.6% for alloys 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Consequently, we developed new formalisms from known acid and Mg2+ dissociation constants by which the observed chemical shift of Pi, deltaPi, and the peak height ratio of the beta- and alpha-ATP resonances, hbeta/alpha, could be related to free [Mg2+] by simultaneous solution of: [equation: see text] We found that hbeta/alpha changed 2.5-fold as free [Mg2+] varied from 0.25 to 1.5 mM, providing a more sensitive and accurate measure of free cytosolic [Mg2+]. In working rat heart perfused with glucose, free [Mg2+] was 1.0 +/- 0.1 from hbeta/alpha and 1.2 +/- 0.03 from measured [citrate]/[isocitrate] but 0.51 +/- 0.1 from deltaalphabeta. Addition of ketone bodies to the perfusate decreased free [Mg2+] estimated from hbeta/alpha to 0.61 +/- 0.02 and 0.74 +/- 0.11 by [citrate]/[isocitrate] but the estimate from deltaalphabeta was unchanged at 0.46 +/- 0.04 mM.

Earth system science for global sustainability: grand challenges \nAbstract: nan \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInsights into how best to attain such international policies can be drawn from innovations at local and regional levels, which are important laboratories for assessing how diverse carbon policies affect economic and social development at multiple scales. Just as countries seek to harmonize public sector research, economic incentives for emerging industries, and public policies to stimulate growth of new competitive industries, a mix of incentives will be needed to generate ideas and technologies to address global change in the context of sustainable development. In particular, we need focused efforts, coupled with careful assessment, on such issues as the potentials and risks of geoengineering strategies (including exploration of local to global institutional arrangements needed to oversee them) and options to meet competing demands for scarce land and water over the next half-century.\n\nA Call to Action\nThese grand challenges provide an overarching research framework to mobilize the international scientifi c community around a focused decade of research to support sustainable development in the context of global environmental change. This will require new research capacity, including efforts to attract young scientists, particularly in developing countries. Research dominated by the natural sciences must transition toward research involving the full range of sciences and humanities. A more balanced mix of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research is needed that actively involves stakeholders and decision-makers.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMost current efforts to build state-of-theart whole-Earth system models depart from sophisticated geophysical kernels (coupled atmosphere-ocean models based on exact dynamical equations like Navier-Stokes) that are to be complemented by equally powerful tools (once they become available) representing other parts of the planetary makeup. But, for instance, there is no marine-biosphere model available that will match the standards of the fl uid-dynamics-based simulators of the atmosphere within the next 5 years, and the situation seems to be even worse when it comes to simulation of economic, social, and cultural processes. Thus, alternative approaches need to be explored, such as distributed simulators, where available models for all relevant Earth system compartments are virtually assembled from institutions around the world, even if those sectoral models differ heavily in predictive power, or an ensembles approach, where a given Earth system module would be represented by an entire set of credible realizations. Research is also needed to assess the potential impact of environmental changes on regional economic conditions, food security, water supplies, health, biodiversity, and energy security.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nGlobal change exposes gaps in social institutions for managing emerging problems. Modern systems of governance are much more effective in addressing national and local problems over time scales of years to decades than in addressing global problems that will affect future generations more strongly than current generations. Addressing problems of global change will require a step change in research on fundamental questions of governance, economic systems, and the assumptions, beliefs, and values underlying human behavior. This must involve close integration of social and biophysical sciences. We must understand how more effective environmental governance can be established at a time of weakening confi dence in traditional forms of governance. It is insuffi cient to identify necessary reforms in policies and institutions; research must explore how to catalyze adoption of those reforms. Encourage innovation (and mechanisms for evaluation) in technological, policy, and social responses to achieve global sustainability. We need to improve our understand-ing about how to strengthen incentives for technology, policy, and institutional innovation to respond to global environmental change. For example, there is need for transformative changes in the world's energy system, including efforts at an international level (e.g., establishing a global cap-and-trade system or a global tax on carbon).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We assess the biophysical option space for feeding the world in 2050 in a hypothetical zero-deforestation world. We systematically combine realistic assumptions on future yields, agricultural areas, livestock feed and human diets. For each scenario, we determine whether the supply of crop products meets the demand and whether the grazing intensity stays within plausible limits. We find that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without deforestation, even at low crop-yield levels. Within the option space, individual scenarios differ greatly in terms of biomass harvest, cropland demand and grazing intensity, depending primarily on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human diets. Grazing constraints strongly limit the option space. Without the option to encroach into natural or semi-natural land, trade volumes will rise in scenarios with globally converging diets, thereby decreasing the food self-sufficiency of many developing regions. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRecent studies suggest that providing sufficient food without cropland expansion is possible  17  , for example, by increasing yields above the current rates  18  , based on higher agricultural inputs and associated with massive trade volumes  19  . In contrast, other studies argue that low-input farming systems, such as organic agriculture, are vital for safeguarding important ecosystem services  [20] [21] [22]  . Whether and under which conditions low-input or organic agricultural systems are able to feed the world is fiercely debated  23, 24  , warranting further investigation  25  . In the context of studies assessing the strategies of land-based climate-change mitigation, the future development of human diets  26, 27  and efficiency gains in global livestock systems  [28] [29] [30] [31]  have been identified as crucial. However, because of their large feed requirements, efficiency gains in livestock systems that are based on the enhanced use of croplandderived concentrate feedstuff can also aggravate land competition for food production  8, 28, 32  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nUnsurprisingly, vegan diets and diets with a low share of livestock products (for example, the VEGETARIAN variant) show the largest number of feasible scenarios, in line with other studies  19, 33, 40  , representing pathways that also make it possible to avoid the otherwise virulent grazing constraints and significantly reduce the option space. Other factors, such as high yields or intensive livestock systems, do not show such a strong effect on the number of feasible scenarios and do not necessarily reduce cropland demand or grazing intensity because the land-sparing effect can be annihilated by rich diets (Figs  3  and 4  and Supplementary Figs  3 4 5 6 ). These findings underpin the insight of other studies that stress the importance of demand-side measures for sustainability  26, 27, 33, 41  . A vegan or vegetarian diet is associated with only half the cropland demand, grazing intensity and overall biomass harvest of comparable meat-based human diets. Furthermore, a decreasing share of livestock products in human diets could also be associated with health benefits, particularly in the industrialized regions  40, 42  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe explore the individual role of supply-side measures (including cropland output intensification and cropland expansion), efficiency measures in the livestock system (increases in feed-conversion ratios) and demand-side measures (quantitative and qualitative changes in the human diet). For each of these parameters, we collected published forecasts for 2050 and incorporated them into a consistent biomass balance model (BioBaM; Supplementary Methods)  38, 39  to assess their combined effects. For each scenario which is a unique combination of individual variants of five parameters (Fig.  1 ), it calculates biomass demand and supply balances-for the globe and for 11 world regions-along with the average grazing intensity and regional biophysical trade balances. We assessed the feasibility of 500 scenarios. 'Feasibility' was defined as a situation in which global food demand is matched by cropland supply, and livestock grazing intensity stays within ecological thresholds. Trade is assumed to balance deficits of regional production and consumption for all feasible scenarios, assuming no trade barriers exist. The option space is defined as the sum of all feasible scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a large range of options exist to feed a no-deforestation world.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Combined with their antigen presentation capacity, this powerful functionality enables pDCs to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. pDCs combine features of both lymphocytes and classical dendritic cells and display unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and IFN production. In the decade since the identification of the pDC as a distinct immune cell type, our understanding of its molecular underpinnings and role in immunity has progressed rapidly. Here we review select aspects of pDC biology including cell fate establishment and plasticity, specific molecular mechanisms of pDC function, and the role of pDCs in T cell responses, antiviral immunity, and autoimmune diseases. Important unresolved questions remain in these areas, promising exciting times in pDC research for years to come. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHowever, E2-2 likely represents only one of several transcription factors and other regulatory molecules (e.g., microRNAs) that collectively regulate different aspects of the pDC development and expression program. Some of the players are known, including pDCenriched transcription factors Irf8 and SpiB. Both genes represent direct targets of E2-2 (32), although their own binding targets and precise role in pDC development and/or function remain to be established. Others, such as the highly pDC-enriched transcription factor Runx2 (25) and other candidates, must be characterized from scratch. Finally, it should be of interest to elucidate the epigenetic events (e.g., chromatin modifications) that accompany pDC commitment, maintenance, and activation.\n\nA Novel pDC-Related Dendritic Cell Subset\nA simple linear view of E2-2-driven pDC development recently became more complicated, as a novel pDC-related cDC subset in mice was identified using Cx3cr1 as a marker  (60) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe Plasticity of pDC Cell Fate\nIt has recently become clear that the terminally differentiated state of many cell types is actively enforced by genetic mechanisms. Thus, the removal of a single transcription factor may cause the loss of lineage identity and the transdifferentiation into an alternative cell fate. A dramatic example is the conversion of adult ovaries into testes after somatic loss of the ovary-specific transcription factor FoxL2  (61) . The ultimately differentiated immune cell lineage, T cells, were recently shown to convert into NK-like cells after the deletion of Bcl11b  (62) . We have tested whether the pDC lineage shows similar plasticity by deleting E2-2 from mature pDCs in vivo  (57) . We found that E2-2-deficient mature pDCs spontaneously differentiate into cDC-like cells, acquiring a cDC phenotype, morphology, antigen-presenting capacity, and expression profile. Such differentiation is consistent with the rapid (within one week) disappearance of peripheral pDCs after E2-2 deletion  (32) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nA similar but less pronounced drift toward the cDC phenotype was observed in E2-2 +/-pDCs, likely underlying the depletion, aberrant phenotype, and impaired function of pDCs in E2-2 +/-mice and human patients  (32) . Thus, continuous E2-2 expression is required to maintain the lineage identity of pDCs and to prevent their spontaneous differentiation into cDC-like cells. These results demonstrate that the pDC cell fate is reversible in principle and raise the question of whether such lineage plasticity may occur in real life. Notably, the cDC-like cells derived from E2-2-deficient pDCs express CD8 yet preferentially upregulate CD8 - cDC-enriched genes, resembling the alternative CD8 + cDC subset  (60) . Although the latter cDC subset is likely derived from early stages of pDC development rather than from mature peripheral pDCs, it may represent a common outcome of a natural or genetically induced pDC-to-cDC conversion (Figure  1 ). Another potential instance of such conversion may occur after pDC activation and is discussed below.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Currently, there is great interest in research into human transcriptional regulation. However, surprisingly little is known about these regulators themselves. For example, how many transcription factors does the human genome contain? How are they expressed in different tissues? Are they evolutionarily conserved? Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation. Much remains to be explored, but this study provides a solid foundation for future investigations to elucidate regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse mammalian biological processes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis resulted in a highconfidence data set of 1,391 genomic loci (~6% of the total number of protein coding genes) that encode TFs, which we will focus on for the remainder of this Analysis article, and a further 216 loci representing possible TFs (see Supplementary information S3 (.txt file) for the data set). estimates of the coverage of our approach range from 85% to 94% (Supplementary information S1 (PDF)) suggesting an upper bound of ~1,700-1,900 TFcoding genes in the human genome. Despite the care that we have taken in compiling this data set, there are a few possible sources of inaccura cies. Our method depends heavily on the content of the InterPro database, and the ability of the search algo rithms to detect these domains in protein sequences. The repertoire should be updated when new InterPro entries for newly discovered DNAbinding domains, or refinements of existing ones, and more sensitive search methods become available.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThis group of proteins mapped to 1,960 human genomic loci in the ensembl Genome Browser database (release 51)  32  . Next, we manually inspected each locus and grouped them according to our confidence in their TF func tionality (Supplementary information S1 (PDF); the full data set is found in Supplementary information S3 (.txt file)): at the highest level, probable TFs have experi mental evidence for regulatory function in any mam malian organism or have an equivalent protein domain arrangement; possible TFs contain nonpromiscuous InterPro DNAbinding domains that are never found in nonTFs, but for which we do not have further func tional evidence; and unlikely TFs comprise predicted genes, genes containing promiscuous InterPro DNA binding domains or genes with an established molecular function other than transcription (such as nucleoporins, threonine phosphatases or splicing factors). Finally, we also included 27 curated probable TFs from other sources, such as GO or TRANSFAC  33  ; these TFs contain undefined DNAbinding domains, and were therefore missed using the above procedure.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs most of these TFs have not been experimentally characterized for regulatory function, we evaluate their tissuespecific expression, genomic distribution and evolutionary conservation. Together, these results provide a solid foundation for further systematic characterization of human TFs in their bio logical context, through traditional molecular approaches and also using genomics techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, proteinbinding microarrays and highthroughput SELEX.\n\nIdentifying the TF repertoire\nTo identify the repertoire of TFs in the human genome we define a class of proteins that binds DNA in a sequencespecific manner, but are not enzymatic or do not form part of the core initiation complex. First we assembled a list of DNAbinding domains and families from the InterPro database (release 17). For each entry we examined the description and associated literature to assess their sequencespecific DNAbinding capabili ties, which resulted in an accurate list of 347 domains and families (Supplementary information S1 (PDF), S2 (.txt file)).

Many of the structural matrix materials that are currently utilized at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, such as solution deposited, high-k dielectrics and commercial photoresists, exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the 8\u201312 \u03bcm spectral range which represents a significant challenge to developing transmissive, three-dimensional (3D) metamaterials operating in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectral region. In this paper, we present new, low loss photopatternable polymer dielectrics as well-suited matrix materials for fabricating LWIR-metamaterials. These materials are synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees followed by a thiol-ene coupling reaction to cross-link the remaining olefin groups. After cross-linking, the olefin LWIR-absorption band is minimized and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the material increases. Thick layers of the polymer (>3 \u03bcm), which acts as a negative photoresist, can be deposited easily using a spin coating technique to develop planarizing layers with photopatternable vias. A demonstration on the low loss nature of the polymer dielectrics was carried out by incorporating the polymer into an all-dielectric, infrared metamaterial. Thus, the material is ideal for both lithography and fabrication of 3D metamaterial structures operating in the LWIR spectral region. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nLow loss photopatternable polymer dielectics appear to be a promising solution. However, off-the-shelf commerically available photoresist polymers also exhibit vibrational absorption bands in the optical regime.  27  An ideal polymer dielectric would have losses comparable to polyethylene but have the additional benefits of a resist in that it is compatible with 3D fabrication techniques, photopatternable, and high temperature process tolerant.  28  We have identified a route to a tunable matrix material which satisfies each of these requirements in the thermal infrared spectral region (8-12 mm).  29, 30  The materials are synthesized using the ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene followed by a partial hydrogenation to remove most of the IR absorbing olefin groups in the 8-12 mm range (Scheme 1). Photopatterning of these materials can then be achieved using the remaining olefin groups via a thiol-ene coupling reaction. After cross-linking, the olefin IR-absorption band is minimized and the T g of the matrix material increases.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nused in microfabrication such as polyimide and benzocyclobutene based polymer (BCB).  27  \n\nPhotopatterning\nThe optimal polymer material was tested next for microfabrication compatibility. Preliminary experiments determined that an adhesion layer was required to ensure that thick films (>1 mm) remained adhered to the silicon substrate during UV exposure. The adhesion layer was deposited by spin casting a layer of non-hydrogenated polynorbornene containing dithiol and photocross-linking via thiol-ene reaction to generate a thin film (28 nm). Next, a solution of partially hydrogenated polynorbornene (18.2%), cross-linker, and photoinitiator was prepared under the same conditions used to make the freestanding films and spun cast onto the wafer (see experimental). The film was irradiated (405 nm, 20 mW cm \u00c02 ) using a mask aligner at a total power of 6,000 mJ cm \u00c02 . The film was then developed in toluene for 5 min to remove the non cross-linked polymer and maintain the exposed regions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n6 ). As expected, the addition of the polymer to the wafer led to an upward shift in wavelength for both electric and magnetic resonances. This is due to an overall increase in the permittivity/refractive index of the resonator system. Finally, an absorption feature was observed at 10.3 mm which is consistent with the peak in the measured extinction coefficient for blanket polynorbornene film. This peak is associated with a small amount of unreacted olefin remaining in the polymer. Ultimately, though, the polymer had little influence on the overall metamaterial loss due to a lack of strong absorptions in the 8-12 mm spectral range. This is in contrast to commercially available photopatternable polymers that have much higher losses.  22, 27  \n\nConclusions\nIn summary, novel low loss photopatternable polymer dielectric materials were synthesized by partially hydrogenating polynorbornene to varying degrees and using the thiol-ene coupling Fig.  6  Cross-section view of an all-dielectric infrared metamaterial taken using SEM (left) and transmission spectra for the same metamaterial before and after adding the optimum polymer material (right).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The geochemistry of the brine suggests that abiotic brine-rock reactions may occur in this system and that the rich sources of dissolved electron acceptors prevent sulfate reduction and methanogenesis from being energetically favorable. The discovery of this ecosystem and the in situ biotic and abiotic processes occurring at low temperature provides a tractable system to study habitability of isolated terrestrial cryoenvironments (e.g., permafrost cryopegs and subglacial ecosystems), and is a potential analog for habitats on other icy worlds where water-rock reactions may cooccur with saline deposits and subsurface oceans. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe permanent ice cover of Lake Vida (Antarctica) encapsulates an extreme cryogenic brine ecosystem \n(-13 \u00b0C; salinity, 200) . This aphotic ecosystem is anoxic and consists of a slightly acidic (pH 6.2) sodium chloride-dominated brine. Expeditions in 2005 and 2010 were conducted to investigate the biogeochemistry of Lake Vida's brine system. A phylogenetically diverse and metabolically active Bacteria dominated microbial assemblage was observed in the brine. These bacteria live under very high levels of reduced metals, ammonia, molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), and dissolved organic carbon, as well as high concentrations of oxidized species of nitrogen (i.e., supersaturated nitrous oxide and \u223c1 mmol\u2022L -1 nitrate) and sulfur (as sulfate). The existence of this system, with active biota, and a suite of reduced as well as oxidized compounds, is unusual given the millennial scale of its isolation from external sources of energy.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMore recently, discoveries of life and associated processes in deep terrestrial subsurface ecosystems (9) provide compelling evidence of subsurface life that in some cases is fueled by nonphotosynthetic processes. Our knowledge of geochemical and microbial processes in aphotic icy environments remains mostly unknown, however, especially at subzero temperatures. Lake Vida is located in Victoria Valley, the northern most of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica (Fig.  S1 ). Initial studies of Lake Vida's thick ice cover described a -11.6 \u00b0C, wet, saline (estimated 245, practical salinity scale) ice at 15.8 m (10). This brine has been isolated by the thick lake ice cover and underlying 800-970 m of permafrost  (11, 12) , prohibiting input of ground water or of annual glacial melt and associated nutrients. 14 C-dating of organic matter sampled at 12 m in the lake ice cover suggests that the brine has been isolated for more than 2,800 y  (10) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWith the LVBr H 2 levels as high as they are, regardless of their source (abiotic or biogenic production), this H 2 could at least supply readily utilizable energy to combat depurination and racemization processes in this harsh ecosystem  (42) . LVBr microbial life is reasonably diverse, maintains cellular rRNA, and retains the ability to synthesize proteins at very low levels. We contend that metabolism in this encapsulated brine ecosystem may last for a prolonged period, well in excess of its \u223c2,800 y of existence.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nField Sampling Campaign. Expeditions to Lake Vida resulted in successful extraction of ice cores (16.5 m in 2005, 20 and 27 m in 2010) and collections of brine that entered the borehole at a depth of \u223c16 m (see Table  S1  for station coordinates). We followed a carefully designed sampling approach in both field campaigns to ensure clean access  (14) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[citation 17].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Controlling fast transport of cold trapped ions \nAbstract: We realize fast transport of ions in a segmented microstructured Paul trap. The ion is shuttled over a distance of more than 10(4) times its ground state wave function size during only five motional cycles of the trap (280 \u03bcm in 3.6 \u03bcs). Starting from a ground-state-cooled ion, we find an optimized transport such that the energy increase is as low as 0.10\u00b10.01 motional quanta. In addition, we demonstrate that quantum information stored in a spin-motion entangled state is preserved throughout the transport. Shuttling operations are concatenated, as a proof-of-principle for the shuttling-based architecture to scalable ion trap quantum computing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor the energy self-neutral shuttling, a sharp kick is used to stop the motion. This is realized by applying a voltage pulse on a nearby electrode segment, being active for only one update sample of the waveform generator (400 ns). The kick delay time, \u03c4 k , between the last voltage update of the transport and the stopping momentum kick is scanned. This effectively changes at which phase in the motional period the force is applied, thus either adding to or removing motional energy. The transport back to segment A is performed adiabatically, such that this part contributes only negligibly to the final excitation. The result is presented in Fig.  3b , where both a positive and a negative voltage kick amplitude is shown, displaying a shift of half a cycle with respect to each other. The amplitude of the voltage kick is calibrated by minimizing the energy transfer at the kick delay time corresponding to the minimum. The self-neutral transports displays an excitation as low as the pair-neutral ones, but allows even faster shuttles.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTransport of neutral atoms have also been performed using magnetic  [10]  or optical  [11]  techniques. Because quantum gate operations require ions close to the motional ground state and fast transport inherently creates motional excitation, the challenge is to develop transport protocols that guarantee sufficiency small energy transfer. In this work we demonstrate shuttling operations that are highly non-adiabatic while the final state of the ion is close to the motional groundstate. We also show that quantum information stored in both the motional and the spin degree of freedom is preserved through the shuttling. During a shuttling operation, the ion motion in the harmonic trapping potential is excited when the acceleration is sufficiently strong. This motional excitation is a harmonic oscillation, characterized by a well defined phase, thus allowing it to be canceled out by proper management of the forces involved during or after the transport. We experimentally demonstrate two methods of canceling the acquired motional excitation. One method uses two shuttles, where the transport to the destination generates the same net momentum transfer as the transport back, but is applied 180 \u2022 out of phase with respect to the secular oscillation of the ion (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1b ). We refer to this as the pairwise energy-neutral transport. For the second scheme, the self-neutral transport we apply a sharp counter-\"kick\" to the ion at the end of a single transport operation, stopping its motion (Fig.  1c ). This case of single-sided transport allows even faster shuttling and can be sequentially repeated since it is energy selfneutral, making it the preferred building block for scalable quantum information protocols. The experiments are carried out in a micro-structured segmented Paul trap  [12] , where the trapping voltage applied to each electrode segment is controlled by an FPGA-based arbitrary waveform generator that allows high resolution for both timing and voltage, while having low noise ( 10nV/ \u221a Hz at the trap frequency). Further noise reduction at high frequencies is done with a \u03a0-type filter having a cut-off frequency of 300 kHz. The axial trap frequency is \u03bd ax = \u03c9 ax /2\u03c0 = 1.41 MHz, while the radial trap frequencies are \u223c 3 MHz. The transport is carried out by varying the voltages on the segments, such that the minimum of the trapping potential is moved towards the final location in time steps of 400 ns.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Therefore, specific crystallographic symmetries or lattice parameters can only be achieved using specific nanoparticles as building blocks (and vice versa). We present six design rules that can be used to deliberately prepare nine distinct colloidal crystal structures, with control over lattice parameters on the 25- to 150-nanometer length scale. These design rules outline a strategy to independently adjust each of the relevant crystallographic parameters, including particle size (5 to 60 nanometers), periodicity, and interparticle distance. As such, this work represents an advance in synthesizing tailorable macroscale architectures comprising nanoscale materials in a predictable fashion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMoreover, a comparison of the modeled phase diagram and the experimental data demonstrated greater than 90 % agreement between the two; i. e. over 90% of the crystal structures obtained experimentally were correctly predicted by the phase diagram as being the most stable arrangement of particles. Because each of the SNA-NPs used to assemble these superlattices is functionalized with a large number of DNA strands, it is possible to put multiple DNA sequences on a single nanoparticle. Therefore, the fifth rule of DNA-programmed assembly is: SNA-NPs can be functionalized with more than one oligonucleotide bonding element, providing access to crystal structures not possible with single element SNA-NPs. For example, a SNA-NP that is functionalized with linkers containing self-complementary sticky ends would be predicted to form an fcc lattice as its thermodynamic product, as per rule 1. However, if this SNA-NP were also functionalized with a second type of DNA linker that contained a sticky end complementary to the sticky ends of a different SNA-NP, additional DNA linkages could be created.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt is therefore the key hypothesis of our efforts in SNA-NP assembly that, because the driving force for crystallization is the formation of duplex DNA linkages: The most stable structure will maximize the number of duplex DNA connections between particles. The simplicity of this hypothesis allows us to understand the behavior of the SNA-NPs in the context of assembly so well that we have been able to develop a set of design rules for the process of crystal formation  [17] . Like Pauling's rules for atoms, these rules explain the relative stability of different lattices as a function of their DNA and nanoparticle building blocks. However, unlike Pauling's rules, this rule set allows one to predict the stability of crystal structures before they are ever synthesized. Therefore, one can direct the formation of a desired crystal structure by controlling different aspects of the building blocks, such as nanoparticle size, nanoparticle shape, DNA length, or DNA sequence  [17] . The first rule in DNA-mediated assembly is: SNA-NPs of equal hydrodynamic radii will form an fcc lattice when using self-complementary DNA sequences, and a bcc lattice when using two SNA-NPs with complementary DNA sequences (Fig.  1 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSince the development of the SNA-NP conjugate in 1996, the Mirkin group, along with others, have taken major strides in being able to utilize this structure as a building block in the synthesis of ordered arrays of nanoparticles. Although early attempts yielded materials that exhibited no long range ordering, short-range ordering and interparticle distance control was demonstrated in subsequent years  [35] . Long-range ordering and crystalline materials were achieved for the first time in 2008 by altering the SNA-NP design to utilize DNA linker strands to connect the nanoparticles  [36] . These linkers consisted of three basic regions: a recognition sequence complementary to the DNA sequence physically attached to the nanoparticle, a spacer sequence used to control the length of the DNA linker, and a short sticky end presented at the hydrodynamic radius of the SNA-NP. Hybridization interactions between sticky ends on adjacent SNA-NPs allow the nanoparticle to link to one another. Because each SNA-NP can be attached to tens to hundreds of DNA linker strands (depending on the nanoparticle core size)  [24] , each nanoparticle can form tens to hundreds of DNA connections to adjacent particles.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Defocus parameters are estimated by fitting a model of the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF) to an image's amplitude spectrum. Here we describe modifications to the algorithm which make it significantly faster and more suitable for use with images collected using modern technologies such as dose fractionation and phase plates. We show that this new version preserves the accuracy of the original algorithm while allowing for higher throughput. We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nEstimating the electron microscope's objective lens defocus and astigmatism from micrographs is of great importance in the three-dimensional reconstruction of biological specimens (reviewed by  Cheng et al., 2015) . Many programs are available for this purpose. Of those, CTFFIND3  (Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003)  is widely used and thought to perform well under a range of circumstances  (Marabini et al., 2015) . We present an updated version of this program, called CTFFIND4, which aims to match the quality of results obtained with CTFFIND3 and to do so significantly faster.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdapted from Figure  3  of  Mindell and Grigorieff (2003) . Diagnostic image from micrograph #1 of set #7 of the CTF challenge, output by CTFFIND4 using runtime parameters detailed in Table  3 . The 2-dimensional CTF (CTF fit ) is overlayed onto the preprocessed amplitude spectrum (A d ) up to the radius corresponding to g max . Figure  3 : Image E generated from the CTF fit to micrograph #1 of set #7 of the CTF challenge. At every pixel (corresponding to a spatial frequency vector g), this image records n, the number of preceding CTF extrema (Equation  11 ). Here this value is color-coded, so that pixels at spatial frequencies before the first extremum of the CTF, which have value 0, are displayed in dark blue. Pixels that have 35 or more preceding CTF extrema are shown in dark red. . One would normally solve this by increasing N d , but we restricted ourselves to previously-used parameter values for this experiment (see caption to Table  3  for more details).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe reasoned that this feature, intended mainly to avoid artefacts in the Fourier transform due to sharp features such as photographic film labels or pieces of dust, was no longer necessary, since the vast majority of datasets are no longer recorded on film, and since features such as film labels can be removed by cropping the micrographs with any of the common image processing packages. In fact, we had noticed that when no features such as film labels were present in the input image, and when only some regions of the micrograph contained carbon film, CTFFIND3's algoritm would often discard those regions. This reduced the amplitude of Thon rings and we hypothesized it might also reduce the accuracy of defocus parameter estimates, though we did not test this. In any case we did not see a need to maintain such a feature in new versions of CTFFIND. To test whether including all areas of the input image in the computation of the spectrum would hinder CTF fitting when dealing with photographic films, we also processed set #5 from the CTF challenge  (Marabini et al., 2015) , which consisted of 17 digitized films including film labels.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Among the four vulture species breeding in the western Palaearctic, the species showing the steepest population decline, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, is a long-distance migrant wintering in Africa. However, the flyways and wintering areas of the species are only known for some populations, and without knowledge of where mortality occurs, effective conservation management is not possible. We tracked 19 juvenile Egyptian Vultures from the declining breeding population on the Balkan Peninsula between 2010 and 2014 to estimate survival and identify important migratory routes and wintering areas for this species. Mortality during the first autumn migration was high (monthly survival probability 0.75) but mortality during migration was exclusively associated with suboptimal navigation. All birds from western breeding areas and three birds from central and eastern breeding areas attempted to fly south over the Mediterranean Sea, but only one in 10 birds survived this route, probably due to stronger tailwind. All eight birds using the migratory route via Turkey and the Middle East successfully completed their first autumn migration. Of 14 individual and environmental variables examined to explain why juvenile birds did or did not successfully complete their first migration, the natal origin of the bird was the most influential. We speculate that in a declining population with fewer experienced adults, an increasing proportion of juvenile birds are forced to migrate without conspecific guidance, leading to high mortality as a consequence of following sub-optimal migratory routes. Juvenile Egyptian Vultures wintered across a vast range of the Sahel and eastern Africa, and had large movement ranges with core use areas at intermediate elevations in savannah, cropland or desert. Two birds were shot in Africa, where several significant threats exist for vultures at continental scales. Given the broad distribution of the birds and threats, effective conservation in Africa will be challenging and will require long-term investment. We recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nyears, however, there has been increasing awareness that events during migration or on wintering grounds can affect populations of migratory animals \n(Newton 2004 , Studds & Marra 2005 , Both et al. 2006) . Identifying migration routes, stopover areas and wintering areas for migratory species that are declining is therefore necessary for designing effective conservation strategies that can address threats operating outside breeding areas  (Wilcove & Wikelski 2008) . The decline of long-distance migrants has been most apparent for passerines and smaller-bodied birds but there is evidence that long-distance migratory raptors are also declining  (Hoffman & Smith 2003) . Among the four vulture species that breed in the western Palaearctic, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is the only longdistance migrant that travels to wintering regions in sub-Saharan Africa  (Porter & Beaman 1985 , Meyburg et al. 2004 , Garc \u0131a-Ripoll es et al. 2010) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDuring this time, winter movement ranges were large and included multiple centres of activity, in which birds remained for several weeks before exploring alternative areas. The average core 50% utilization distribution was 28 000 km 2 , but ranged from < 5000 to  > 90 000 km 2 among individuals (Table  3 ). Winter movement ranges (100% minimum convex polygon) were more than an order of magnitude larger (> 310 000 km 2 ), with similarly large varia-tion among individuals (Table  3 ). Wintering regions ranged from southwest Yemen to Nigeria, with core wintering areas in southern Chad and Sudan (Fig.  3 ). Head length (cm) Log(probability of successful migration)/2 The habitat in core ranges in which juvenile vultures spent 50% of their time differed from the habitat encountered in winter movement ranges. Our random forest model explained 81.9% of the variation in the data and successfully classified locations as core wintering locations. Elevation and landscape type were the most important variables distinguishing core locations from those available in movement ranges (Table  4 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nStart of autumn migration was defined as the first day on which birds travelled over 100 km, the end of autumn migration was defined as the first day south of 22\u00b0N latitude when a bird reversed its course or remained stationary. Migration distance was the cumulative distance between all subsequent locations during the migration period, and migration speed was the migration distance divided by the number of days spent migrating  (Alerstam 2003) . The wintering period was defined as the time between the end of autumn migration and the onset of spring migration, and we used all locations from that time period to estimate a movement range for each individual. For the birds still alive after 2 years, the onset of spring migration was defined as the date when the first northward movement was initi-ated that ultimately took the bird north of 22\u00b0N. The winter movement range was calculated as the minimum convex polygon of 100% of the winter locations to be comparable with a previous study  (Meyburg et al. 2004) , and the home-ranges were calculated as the 95% and 50% kernel utilization distribution (Garc \u0131a-Ripoll es et al. 2010).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This device achieves a dynamic range of 10(7), single-nucleotide-variant detection below one copy per 100,000 wild-type sequences and the discrimination of a 1% difference in chromosome copy number. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nINTRODUCTION\nAdvances in basic research and molecular diagnostics capabilities are intimately coupled to the development of ever more precise and sensitive measurement technologies. Quantitative (q)PCR is the current gold standard for DNA measurement and genetic diagnostics but remains poorly suited to measurements of absolute concentration, has a limited precision (~20%), and presents difficulties in reliably detecting low-copy-number templates due to nonspecific amplification and competitive side reactions. qPCR measurements are thus inadequate for demanding applications such as early detection of cancer and monitoring of residual disease  [1] , analysis of single-cell gene expression  [2] , and the diagnosis of fetal genetic disorders using small allelic imbalances in circulating DNA.\n\nTHEORY\nA promising solution to such measurement problems is digital PCR  [3] , a single-molecule counting technique. Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample at limiting dilution followed by PCR amplification and endpoint detection to identify the presence or absence of template molecules in each reaction. All performance metrics of digital PCR, including sensitivity, precision and dynamic range, improve with the total number of digital reactions performed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAfter PCR thermocycling, the devices were scanned at 0.5 micron per pixel (Figure  1d ) and analyzed using a custom image analysis software written in C for automated segmentation of chambers (Figure  1e ). \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nHere we present a valve-free microfluidic digital PCR device that performs a million single molecule PCR reactions in uniform arrays of pl volume chambers having densities up to 440,000 reactions cm -2 (Figure  1a ). Our device uses surface tension to achieve partitioning of the sample into a uniform array of pl-volume sub-reactions. The sample is injected into a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) device featuring a bifurcating channel network, having a cross-section of 3 \u00b5m x 3 \u00b5m, that connects to linear arrays of 10 pl (20 \u00b5m \u00d7 20 \u00b5m \u00d7 25 \u00b5m) \"dead-end\" chambers. The reagent solutions are then pushed in the device until complete filling and partitioning of the chambers is achieved by flushing an immiscible fluorinated oil that preferentially wets the channel walls, displacing the remaining aqueous phase (Figure  1c ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nReliable discrimination of 2% and 3% enrichment was obtained reproducibly using sub-arrays of 100,000 chambers, while 1% enrichment was only well-resolved using full 1,000,000 chamber arrays.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn addition to enabling new measurements in biomedical research and diagnostics, the high assay density in our device has important implications for the adoption of digital PCR as a routine analytical tool. Thus, we contend that megapixel digital PCR or similar high-density formats will ultimately replace real-time qPCR as the standard analytical tool for absolute DNA measurement.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In particular, the remarkable device efficiency is strongly influenced by the perovskite crystallinity and the film morphology. Here, we investigate the perovskites crystallisation kinetics and growth mechanism in real time from liquid precursor continually to the final uniform film. We utilize some advanced in situ characterisation techniques including synchrotron-based grazing incident X-ray diffraction to observe crystal structure and chemical transition of perovskites. The nano-assemble model from perovskite intermediated [PbI6]4- cage nanoparticles to bulk polycrystals is proposed to understand perovskites formation at a molecular- or nano-level. A crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic crystallisation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these in situ dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation and transformation from the molecular to the microstructure over relevant temperature and time scales is successfully demonstrated. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1 . For the traditional spincoating technique  21  , most of the deposition solution is ejected during rotation and the subsequent thermal annealing process begins with the intermediated complex film, hindering the capture of the whole crystallisation process. The in situ printing experiment was conducted in the helium atmosphere to reduce the air scattering. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 M lead acetate (Pb(Ac) 2 ) and 1.2 M methylammonium iodide (MAI) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). A PEDOT:PSS-coated silicon wafer was used as the sample substrate. Different substrate temperatures were adjusted to control the kinetics of crystallisation. A series of 2D GIXD images at different stages of drying are shown in Fig.  1  and Supplementary Fig.  2 . In a starting solution, the mixed precursors are essentially point scatters dissolved in DMF, where the liquid scattering from DMF dominates, with a diffuse reflection at qB1.5 \u00c5 \u00c0 1 being evident.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe 60 \u00b0C-processed thin film with smaller size droplets were still not continuous. At 80 \u00b0C, the film showed slightly enlarged droplets, many of which merged together to form larger domains. When the heating temperature was increased to 100 \u00b0C, a highly regular, banded topography with a period of B2 mm was seen (Supplementary Figs  10  and 11 ). The height variation of this periodic structure at the surface, that is, the amplitude, was B200 nm (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). At the centre of these banded structures, a plateau consisting of nanoscopic crystallites was also observed. These structures are very much akin to spherlitic textures seen in semi-crystalline polymers and metals  [35] [36] [37]  , where a radial growth of crystals emanates from a nucleus, and as the crystals grow outward, the growth fronts impinge on each other, arresting the crystallisation, forming the polygonal textures. The sizes and shapes of the polygonal structures are dictated by the areal density of nucleation  35  . The higher the nucleation density, the smaller the textures.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nT molecular-or nano-scale. The temperature-dependent crystallisation process also makes effects on the final film morphology. The time evolution of the film morphology under in situ heating is obtained by the compound optical microscope. The formation of periodic patterns during the growth process is observed which could be attributed to a competition between the linear growth of the crystals and a depletion of crystallisable material. The crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic nucleation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation from molecular to microstructure is successfully demonstrated.\n\n\nResults\nPerovskites crystallisation and structure transformation. All GIXD measurements were performed on beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Sources of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with critical methods to obtain the perovskites structure formation and crystal growth in real time. To in situ monitor the whole evolution process at the very beginning with the precursor solution, a compatible mini-slot-die printer  20  was integrated with on-line GIXD, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Imaging of fluorescent proteins (FPs) using red excitation light in the 'optical window' above 600 nm is one potential method for visualizing implanted cells. However, previous efforts to engineer FPs with peak excitation beyond 600 nm have resulted in undesirable reductions in brightness. Here we report three new red-excitable monomeric FPs obtained by structure-guided mutagenesis of mNeptune. Two of these, mNeptune2 and mNeptune2.5, demonstrate improved maturation and brighter fluorescence than mNeptune, whereas the third, mCardinal, has a red-shifted excitation spectrum without reduction in brightness. We show that mCardinal can be used to non-invasively and longitudinally visualize the differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes in living mice with high anatomical detail. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFusion gene construction\nmCardinal cDNA was PCR amplified with a 5\u2032 primer encoding an AgeI site and a 3\u2032 primer encoding either a BspEI (C1) or NotI (N1) site for C-terminal and N-terminal fusions (with regards to the FP), respectively. The purified and digested PCR products were ligated into similarly digested pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-N1 cloning vectors to create pmCardinal-C1 and pmCardinal-N1. A cDNA fragment encoding each protein domain was PCR amplified with primers containing the appropriate restriction enzyme sites and ligated into pmCardinal-C1 or pmCardinal-N1. To prepare fusions at the N-terminus of mCardinal, the following digests were performed: human non-muscle \u03b1-actinin (GenBank accession number NM_001130005.1, source: Tom Keller, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, U.S.A.), EcoRI and NotI; human calnexin (NM_001746.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nLentiviral constructs expressed in MuSCs were hLIG-EF1\u03b1-mCardinal-IRES PV -luciferase2 and pLL3.7-EF1\u03b1-mCardinal-IRES EMCV -Clover-P2A-luciferase2.

Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Ni\u00f1o years record larger than average atmospheric CO2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric CO2 and climate change. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n), they would show a significant reduction of carbon uptake, primarily driven by the ocean stratification, and reduced ocean thermohaline circulation  [28] [29] [30] . Terrestrial models also investigated the effect of CO 2 and climate, always agreeing on the positive response of land carbon storage to atmospheric CO 2 increase (the so-called fertilization effect), but not reaching consensus on the terrestrial ecosystem response to the associated climate change. Some earlier studies found an enhanced terrestrial productivity  [31]  while later studies found the opposite  [32, 33] . The third assessment report of IPCC concluded that, by mid-twenty-first century, climate change would reduce the land carbon uptake by 21% to 43% and the ocean carbon uptake by 6% to 25%, relative to CO 2 only driven uptakes  [34] . This IPCC range was very conservative, as further discussed below. Nevertheless, all these studies gave a clear signal to the climate modelling community: one cannot simulate future climate change assuming atmospheric CO 2 can be known, a priori, from the CO 2 emissions trajectory.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe climatepermafrost carbon gain is hence very uncertain; as the RCP8.5 emissions are about 2000 GtC for the twenty-first century, the permafrost carbon release, 50-250 GtC, translates into a gain ranging between 2.5% and 12.5%. CO 2 fertilization, i.e. the increase of terrestrial plants productivity as a response to atmospheric CO 2 increase, remains one of the major source of uncertainty in the CMIP5 ESMs carbon cycle projections  [40] . Although the basic process is relatively well understood: elevated CO 2 stimulates plant photosynthesis, increasing biomass production and hence carbon uptake, the quantification at the global scale remains poorly constrained. There are no long-term global observations of photosynthesis yet that could be used to evaluate models responses. In addition, the induced carbon sink does not only depends on the rate of increase of photosynthesis, it also depends on the residence time of carbon in biomass and soils, delaying the increase in heterotrophic decomposition. Surprisingly, CMIP5 ESMs showed a very wide range of residence time and hence global vegetation and soil carbon estimates  [61, 62] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor example, we have a reasonably good understanding of the global ocean and land carbon sinks, but the attribution of these sinks to CO 2 , increase, change in climate, atmospheric deposition of nutrients, or changes in land management cannot be directly measured. Nevertheless, there is hope that remote sensing of atmospheric CO 2 could provide better spatial and temporal coverage of atmospheric CO 2 and hence carbon sinks, allowing the attribution of their spatial-temporal patterns to their drivers, in a similar way that attribution of climate change. Benchmarking of carbon cycle models is now possible, several datasets can be used to constrain global carbon cycle models, both for the land and the ocean  [61, 63] . Although they cannot directly constrain the carbon cycle sensitivities, they can help evaluate to ability of models to simulate the mean state of the system, such as gross fluxes and reservoirs. Finally, there are numerous other biological processes that can be affected by climate change, and potentially induce a feedback on the human induced warming, such as N 2 O emissions, isoprene and ozone chemistry, fires and aerosols emissions.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We show that the singularity corrections for treating these divergencies depend only on the total number and the positions of k points and on the lattice vectors, in particular, the unit cell volume, but not on the particular positions of atoms within the unit cell. The method proposed here to treat the singularities constitutes a stable, simple to implement, and general scheme that can be applied to systems with arbitrary lattice parameters within either the EXX Kohn-Sham or the HF formalism. We apply the singularity correction to a typical symmetric structure, diamond, and to a more general structure, trans-polyacetylene. We consider the effect of the singularity corrections on volume optimizations and k-point convergence. While the singularity correction clearly depends on the total number of k points, it exhibits a remarkably small dependence upon the choice of the specific arrangement of the k points. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIII. RESULTS FOR DIAMOND AND TRANS -POLYACETYLENE\nThe applicability of the presented approach for treating the divergencies is now demonstrated by applying it to two cases, diamond and trans-polyacetylene, using different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals: the Slater-Dirac (exchange-only LDA) referred to as Dirac exchange in the following, the complete exchange-correlation LDA in the parametrisation of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN), 8 the combination of Dirac exchange plus Perdew86 9 (P86) correlation (P86 being VWN correlation plus a gradient correction), the EXX (exact-exchange only), and finally the combination of EXX with P86 correlation. The pseudopotentials were generated using the pseudopotential generation code of Engel,  26  which is based on the Troullier-Martins norm-conserving scheme.  27  In all cases the pseudopotentials were generated using consistently the same functionals for exchange and correlation as for the plane wave calculations. Relativistic effect are not included.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nEXX methods therefore are free of Coulomb self-interactions. As a result EXX band structures and in particular band gaps are strongly improved compared to those from LDA or GGA methods. Indeed for medium gap semiconductors EXX methods yield band gaps 2 which are very close to the experimental ones  11  despite the fact that the correlation potential needs to be neglected or approximated by conventional LDA or GGA functionals, and despite the fact that the KS band gap does not account for the derivative discontinuity  12, 13  of the band gap at integer electron numbers. A second first-principles approach besides the family of density-functional methods is the Hartree-Fock (HF) method.  14, 15  Recently, there has been an increasing interest in HF methods for solids as basis for higher level approaches like, e.g., M\u00f8ller-Plesset,  16, 17  coupled cluster  18  or multireference configuration interaction  19  methods. Both in the EXX and in the HF formalism the exchange energy contains divergent terms.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe reduction of the total energy from EXX to EXX-P86 is of the same order as the reduction from Diracexchange only to the Dirac exchange plus P86 correlation. However, the lattice constant minimum of the EXX-P86 is shifted to a much lower value than any other of the combinations of functionals. The reason for this maybe the reintroduction of self-interations, through the P86 correlation function. In any case, the poor performance of the combination EXX-P86 is not surprising because the P86 correlation is not meant to be used with the EXX, but rather with the LDA or GGA exchange in order to exploit error cancelations between exchange and correlation. Therefore, development of correlation functionals that do not depend on such error cancelations and thus are well-suited for combination with the EXX is highly desirable. The EXX energy optimised lattice equals 3.555 \u00c5 [see Fig.  3 ]. It becomes natural now to evaluate the band structure at the EXX energy minimum. Figure  4  shows the band structure at this EXX energy minimum.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The resulting fusion gene products have attracted considerable interest as diagnostic and promising therapeutic targets. So far, oncogenic FET fusion proteins have been regarded as strong transcription factors that aberrantly activate or repress target genes of their DNA-binding fusion partners. However, the role of the transactivating domain in the context of the normal FET proteins is poorly defined, and, therefore, our knowledge on how FET aberrations impact on tumor biology is incomplete. Since we believe that a full understanding of aberrant FET protein function can only arise from looking at both sides of the coin, the good and the evil, this paper summarizes evidence for the central function of FET proteins in bridging RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFUS has been demonstrated to bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs  [15] . EWS might have similar sequence specificity since it was demonstrated to bind strongly to both poly G and poly U, but not to poly A and poly C RNA, homopolymers  [16] . Although it is only the zinc finger domain of FUS that makes physical contact with the GGUG motif, all three RGG boxes together with the RRM contribute to this activity  [15] . Intriguingly, a recent study identified strong binding of FUS to human telomeric RNA  [17]  and to small low-copy-number RNAs tethered to the promoter of cyclin D1  [18] . Nothing is known about the RNA binding specificity TAF15.\n\nA Role for FET\nProteins in RNA Transcription. The FET N-terminal domain (NTD) resembles the activation domain of certain transcription factors such as SP-1 rich in glutamine and proline residues.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe Oncogenic Function of FET Fusion Protein.\nThe predominant type of FET gene aberrations is that of fusions to various transcription factor genes by which the FET RNAbinding domain is replaced by the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor (Table  2 ). FET fusion proteins are capable of transforming cells in culture dependent on the cellular context. EWS-ETS fusions, for example, transform NIH3T3 and bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells, but not human or rat primary fibroblasts, mouse embryonic stem cells, or embryonic fibroblasts  [102, 103] . The phenotype of tumors obtained in immunodeficient mice after transplantation of EWS-ETS-transformed NIH3T3 cells clearly differs from that obtained after transformation with other EWS-transcription factor fusions and resembles that of Ewing's sarcoma  [104, 105] . In the xenograft model, the amino terminal portion of EWS, as well as FUS (and presumably also TAF15), is functionally interchangeable in the fusion protein, while the transcription factor moiety determines the tumor phenotype  [7] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntriguingly, the RNA binding activity of FUS was reported to act as a sensor for DNA damage and to elicit transcriptional repression; as exemplified for cyclin D (CCND1) promoter regulation, DNA damage was demonstrated to induce the expression of single-stranded, low-copy-number ncRNA transcripts tethered to the 5 regulatory regions of CCND1 which recruit FUS and allosterically modify it to bind to and repress CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities  [18] .

Comparison with earlier work on noncrystalline solids shows that they all have the same conductivity within a factor of 5 over the entire temperature range investigated, with the same characteristic plateau around 10 \u00b0K, and that their conductivity varies as Tn, n\u223c1.8, below T = 1 \u00b0K. Furthermore, the average phonon mean free path is large by comparison with the phonon wavelength, about 10\u22124 cm at 2 \u00b0K and decreasing as T\u22124 at larger T, suggesting a Rayleigh-type scattering mechanism. Such a mean free path can be quantitatively explained by approximating the glassy structure with that of a crystal in which every atom is displaced from its lattice site. Then every atom scatters like an interstitial atom, or\u2014even simpler\u2014like one that is missing at its regular lattice site, with a scattering cross section determined by the missing mass (isotopic defect). The specific heat of amorphous SiO2, GeO2, and Se has been found to vary as AT+BT3 between 0.1 and 1 \u00b0K, with A = 10 erg/g\u00b0K2 within a factor of 2. This departure from the Debye specific heat may be characteristic of the glassy state, as all earlier measurements of other glasses [polystyrene, glycerol, Lucite (PMMA)] indicate a similar anomaly. Its origin is not clear. Impurities or surface effects through adsorbed gases are unlikely because of the many samples and experimental techniques used in different laboratories. We have tried to attribute the anomaly to low-lying electronic states, motional states of ions, trapped atoms or large groups of atoms, or one-dimensional vibrations within a three-dimensional solid, so far without success. At the present time, the only independent evidence for these excitations appears to be in the low-temperature thermal conductivity at T < 1 \u00b0K described above. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA summary of the chemical composition of glasses can be found in Ref. 6. phonon mean free path / is defined by where E is the thermal conductivity, C\" the specific heat of the plane lattice waves, and v the Debye sound velocity, /at1 'K is found tobe of order 10 lcm in glasses, i. e. , 100times the wavelength of the domi- identical. Even noncrystalline solids with completely different chemical compositions, such as s 14-1v varnishes 18 Se 12 and Geoa 19 all have very similar conductivities (Fig.  3 ).

' Their conductivities are consid- erably smaller below 1 'K than those of the noncrys- talline solids, they depend on the sample, and they usually vary more rayidly with temperature. The dependence of the conductivity on the crystallinity of polyethylene has been studied by  Salinger.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe thermal conductivity of noncrystalline dielectric solids differs markedly from that of crystalline ones. ' As an example, Fig.  1  shows the conductivities of crystalline and vitreous silicon dioxide. In crystals, the conductivity increases with decreasing temperature because the anhar- monic umklapp processes become less frequent, and hence the phonon mean free path increases. Eventually, the mean free path becomes comparable to the sample dimensions, and the conductivity goes through a maximum and then decreases as the specific heat decreases. The conductivity of crystals depends very much on the material, and in ad- dition any disturbance of the lattice periodicity lowers the conductivity in a sometimes very characteristic way, as shown in Fig.  1 , for example. In noncrystalline solids, the conductivity is several orders of magnitude smaller than in crystals, it decreases monotonically with decreasing tempera- ture, and furthermore it is independent of the chem- ical composition: In Fig.  2 , the conductivity of vitreous silica~' 7 is compared with that of silica- based glasses containing large amounts of other oxides.  '  The conductivities are practically surfaces.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis anomaly may also be responsible for the thermal conductivity below 1 'K. Its origin is yet un- known. r=C\"md yZ, (2) 200 where C\"m and E are the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the sample, respectively, and d is a characteristic length, typically a diameter of the sample. For the noncrystalline samples used in this investigation, this v was less than 0. 1 sec at the lowest temperatures, and increased to approx- imately 1 sec at 1 K. For the crystals, v was even shorter. The largest source of error was random building vibrations transmitted to the sample, causing random temperature fluctuations and hence uncertainties in the determination of the sample temperature while the sample temperature returned to that of the bath following a heat pulse. These fluctuations caused a maximum error of 20% in the specific heat below 0. 1 'K, but were negli- gible above 0. 2'K. As a test of our technique, we measured the specific heat C\"of single crystal Rl)81 and 8101 (Flg. 7).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis eventually will lead to wrong results in the bulk and we strongly recommend all other DFs \u0351in particular, BLYP, revPBE, and B97-D at the semi-local level\u0352 together with DFT-D3 for water-related problems. The most striking conclusion from the analysis of the statistical benchmark data is the enhanced accuracy of the new version for the very important and difficult tripeptide folding test set \u0351PCONF, see Refs. 98, 112, and 113\u0352 with all DFs. In Fig.  9  we compare ten conformational energies with the old and new methods for selected DFs and note in passing that deviations for most uncorrected functionals are so large \u0351MAD=2-5 kcal/ mol\u0352 that the curves would not fit within the chosen energy scale. As pointed out previously,  58  theoretical peptide folding without dispersion corrections makes absolutely no sense! Generally, the MAD values for DFT-D3 are about a factor of 1/2 lower compared to DFT-D2 \u0351see also Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSimilar to the case of the alkaline metal systems, also here DFT-D2 strongly overbinds yielding adsorption energies of 28-30 kcal/mol and relatively short interplane distances \u03fd2.9 \u00c5. This is at least in part corrected with DFT-D3 and both functionals yield more realistic distances \u0351which unfortunately is experimentally not known\u0352 and a binding energy of about 22 kcal/mol which compares better with the experimental value of 13 kcal/mol. Consideration of vibrational zero-point energies would bring theory and experiment in even closer agreement. Note also that the differences between the two functionals nicely diminish with DFT-D3  compared to DFT-D2 which has been also observed for other test systems. The correctly reduced dispersion energy in DFT-D3 compared to DFT-D2 results from both, the increased cutoff radius of Ag \u03511.665 versus 1.49 \u00c5\u0352 and a reduced C 6 coefficient \u0351269 versus 428 a.u.\u0352. Note, that neither a silver containing system nor any metal surface-related problem has been included in the fit set for the determination of the DF specific parameters.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n98. If one considers the large average binding energy of 82.0 kcal/mol, the DFT-D3 results can be regarded as mostly very accurate and an MAD value of about 2 kcal/mol for PW6B95 is close to the accuracy of the reference values \u0351and to remaining basis set incompleteness effects\u0352. For all 11 DFs the average MAD decreases from 7.8 \u0351DFT\u0352 to 5.2 \u0351DFT-D2\u0352 and 4.3 kcal/mol for DFT-D3. Only for PBE and PBE0 which have a clear overbinding tendency already without any correction, \u0351both\u0352 versions worsen the results. Note, however, that these two DFs without correction do not give the right answer for the right reason: they simulate the effects of dispersion \u0351that become more important as the size of the system increases\u0352 by overbinding of each hydrogen bond.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n4 ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of complete healing (albeit non-autonomous) of a high field-effect mobility conjugated polymer after mechanical damages.

Our obtained device yield is 100%, along with good switching performance (Fig.  3b-e ). Furthermore, most of the devices exhibited field-effect mobilities in the range of about 10 -1 cm 2 V -1 s -1 with > 10 5 on/off current ratio (Supplementary Fig.  29 ). In specific, the highest value obtained for the mobility is 0.6 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , while the average mobility was 0.28 cm 2 V -1 s -1 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIncreasing the non-conjugated moiety content within the backbone also improved the solubility in polar solvents such as THF and DMF. The synthetic procedures for precursors, monomers and polymers are detailed in the Supplementary Information. Molecular weight, polydispersity index, monomers and polymer characterization are all detailed in the Supplementary Information. All results are from polymers with number average molecular weight M n over 14 kDa and with a polydispersity below 4. Polymers with low M n values showed less improvement in stretchability.

They were subsequently transferred to PDMS elastic substrates. The thin-film annealing temperature was found to affect stretchability.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe thin-film annealing temperature was found to affect stretchability. Significantly less improvement was observed for samples annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min. Therefore, annealing for 10 min was used for all films.

The case of Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas (EFCAs) in China is telling [citation 22].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Securing natural capital and expanding equity to rescale civilization \nAbstract: In biophysical terms, humanity has never been moving faster nor further from sustainability than it is now. Our increasing population size and per capita impacts are severely testing the ability of Earth to provide for peoples' most basic needs. Awareness of these circumstances has grown tremendously, as has the sophistication of efforts to address them. But the complexity of the challenge remains daunting. We explore prospects for transformative change in three critical areas of sustainable development: achieving a sustainable population size and securing vital natural capital, both in part through reducing inequity, and strengthening the societal leadership of academia. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nTaken together, these efforts span the globe and target a full suite of ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water supply, flood control, coastal protection and enhancement of scenic beauty (and associated recreation/ tourism values)  67, 68  . The ecosystem service investments being made in China today stand out in their ambitious goals, scale and duration. Prompted by massive droughts and flooding in 1997-1998, China implemented several national forestry and conservation initiatives to address the nation's growing environmental crises, involving approximately 120 million households and investing approximately 700 billion yuan over 2000-2010  69  . China is currently also undertaking a first national assessment of ecosystem services, spanning a wide range of ecosystems, services and scales. Perhaps most ambitiously, China is establishing a new network of 'ecosystem function conservation areas' (EFCAs; Fig.  3 ). EFCAs are being zoned so as to focus conservation and restoration in places with high return on investment for public benefit; at the same time, high-impact human activities are being zoned to sustain or enhance natural capital values.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese initiatives have dual goals: to harmonize people and nature by securing critical natural capital, and to alleviate poverty. Specifically, the government aims to protect ecosystems and their biodiversity for flood control, hydropower production efficiency, irrigation supply, more productive agriculture and tourism. In addition, it aims to open non-farm sectors, increase household income and make land-use practices more sustainable in rural areas  70  . Although these initiatives represent a massive scientific and policy undertaking, there is still little understanding of the local costs of implementation, or their effects on poor and vulnerable populations in or near the target areas. The EFCA model represents a new paradigm for integrating conservation and human development, but for this policy innovation to have wide applicability, it will be important to assess and improve local livelihoods  71  .\n\nGender and gender equity in sustainability\nAs evidence for the value of community-based resource management has accumulated  72  , a special role for women in environmental sustainability has begun to emerge. Cross-national studies reveal a strong association between high levels of deforestation and impaired \n\nRESEARCH REVIEW\nhealth for women, increased household labour and reduced income  73  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn theory, if institutions recognize the values of ecosystem services, then we can greatly enhance investments in the natural capital that generates them and foster human well-being at the same time. In practice, we are still in the early stages of developing the scientific basis, and the policy and finance mechanisms, for integrating natural capital into land use and other resource decisions on large scales. Relative to other forms of capital, assets embodied in ecosystems have been poorly understood and scarcely monitored, and are undergoing rapid, unchecked degradation  [56] [57] [58]  . Natural capital and the ecosystem services that flow from it are typically undervalued-by governments, businesses and the public-and recognized only upon their loss  [59] [60] [61] [62]  . The urgent challenge today is to move from theory to real-world honing and implementation of ecosystem service tools and approaches to resource decisions taken by individuals, communities, corporations, governments and other organizations  63  . A great diversity of efforts to implement the ecosystem services framework has emerged worldwide (Box 1). Collectively, they represent a promising shift towards a more inclusive, integrated and effective set of strategies  [64] [65] [66]  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Obstacles blocking wider adoption of FIB-SEM include slow imaging speed and lack of long-term system stability, which caps the maximum possible acquisition volume. Here, we present techniques that accelerate image acquisition while greatly improving FIB-SEM reliability, allowing the system to operate for months and generating continuously imaged volumes > 106 \u00b5m3. These volumes are large enough for connectomics, where the excellent z resolution can help in tracing of small neuronal processes and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming human proofreading effort. Even higher resolution can be achieved on smaller volumes. We present example data sets from mammalian neural tissue, Drosophila brain, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to illustrate the power of this novel high-resolution technique to address questions in both connectomics and cell biology. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe probe current was set at ~4 nA and working distance at ~3 mm with imaging speed of 4 MHz. The x-y pixel size was 8 nm for both systems unless noted. SEM images were acquired for every 2 nm of material removal. After the final image series were registered using IMOD  (Kremer et al., 1996)  or SIFT plug-in of Fiji  (Schindelin et al., 2012) , every four consecutive images were binned down to one, forming an image stack with isotropic voxels of 8 \u00c2 8 \u00c2 8 nm 3 . The gallium FIB column was operated at 30 keV. A 7-nA probe current was selected for milling with the FEI Magnum column, while a 13-or 27-nA probe current was used in a Zeiss NVision40. A repeated line scan of 0.1 mm pixel and 1-MHz frequency was applied. A 10 Hz PID closed-loop algorithm written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controlled the line scan position relative to the specimen block-face.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe trimming is usually guided by optical inspection under a microtome and X-ray tomography data obtained by a Zeiss Versa XRM-510. The limited block-face size ensures a complete removal of the block-face material, rather than forming a trench in the sample.

The probe current was set at ~3 nA and working distance at ~4.5 mm with imaging speed of 1.25 MHz. Images acquired on a Zeiss Merlin system (hybrid with 90 degree mounted FEI Magnum FIB) used slightly different conditions: landing energy was 1.2 keV with 0.6 keV electron beam energy with a sample bias of 0.6 kV.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBased on the automated segmentation and human proofreading speed and error rate, we determined that a voxel sampling of 8 nm was optimal for our Drosophila connectomics studies.

For low-voltage (~1 keV) SEM's operating with 0.1-10.0 nA on the primary beam, the resolution is a function of current  (Reimer, 1993) .

A triple point was found in each compound below 100 MPa. By pressurization, the low pressure phases disappeared at the triple point in the chloride and bromide while a new high-pressure phase appeared in the iodide. The pressures and temperatures of the triple points are 75.1 MPa, 175.7 K for CH3NH3PbCl3, 43.2 MPa, 152.9 K for CH3NH3PbBr3, and 84.8 MPa, 176.2 K for CH3NH3PbI3. All the boundaries between the cubic and tetragonal phases are upward convex and that of the iodide has a maximum at about 120 MPa. Other phase boundaries are essentially straight lines in the measured pressure and temperature ranges. By the use of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the transition volumes were calculated from the slopes of the phase boundaries and the transition entropies obtained in a previously published calorimetric experiment (J. Phys. Chem. Solids51, 1383 (1990)). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe heating rate was 0.6-0.9 K min-I. The Pna2, -I4/mcm transition of the crystal occurred at higher temperatures with increasing pressure. On further pressurization, the peak split into two at around 85 MPa. The two peaks separated further at higher pressures. This indicates that the triple point exists at about 85 MPa, above which a new phase appears. Thus, the triple points were found in all of the three MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals below 100 MPa. The experimental DTA curves of MAPbBr, and MAPbI, in the high temperature region are shown in Figs  4  and 5 , respectively. The heating rates were 0.7-1.0 and 0.7-0.8 K min-' for MAPbBr, and MAPbI,, respectively. An endothermic peak due to the I4/mcm -Pm3m transition was observed in both samples.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nthe authors \n[5]  and the structures determined by Poglitsch et al.  [3]  are summarized in Table  1 . The bromide has two tetragonal phases. One of them corresponds to the tetragonal phase of the chloride and the other to that of the iodide. In a recent paper  [5] , we reported calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I), where MA represents the methylammonium ion, CH,NH: . All the phase transitions were of the first order. The large transition entropies indicated that the phase transitions are of the order-disorder type. The entropy values were interpreted with structural models in which each MA ion is disordered with respect to the orientations of the C-N axis itself and around the C-N axis. In the present paper, we investigate the pressure dependence of the phase transitions of MAPbX, (X = Cl, Br, I) by using a high pressure DTA.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nOur purpose is to determine the p-T phase diagrams of the three halides and thereby to obtain \n\nEXPERIMENTAL\nThe sample preparation of MAPbX, is the same as described in the previous paper  [5] .

The temperature difference between the two wells was measured by a copper<onstantan thermocouple encapsulated in a stainless-steel sheath and was recorded on a strip chart as a function of temperature.

In most cases when noninvasive imaging is not used, studies assume a consistent baseline condition in rats that lack visible differences. While performing a series of traumatic brain injury studies, we discovered mild spontaneous ventriculomegaly in 70 (43.2%) of 162 Wistar rats that had been obtained from 2 different vendors. Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, including MR angiography and diffusion tensor imaging, were used to evaluate the rats. Multiple neuropathologic abnormalities, including presumed arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, cysts, white matter lesions, and astrogliosis were found in association with ventriculomegaly. Postmortem microcomputed tomography and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Diffusion tensor imaging showed significant decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in multiple white matter tracts (p < 0.05). These results could impact the interpretation, for example, of a pseudo-increase of axon integrity and a pseudo-decrease of myelin integrity, based on characteristics intrinsic to rats with ventriculomegaly. We suggest the use of baseline imaging to prevent the inadvertent introduction of a high degree of variability in preclinical studies of neurologic disease or injury in Wistar rats. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMR techniques including T 2 -weighted, T 2 *-weighted, DTI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (in subset of animals) were performed to diagnose the abnormality in vasculature and white matter. Postmortem micro-CT and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were also performed to verify the imaging findings and inspect the spontaneous anomalies in the CNS of the ventriculomegaly Wistar rats. The presence of these spontaneous ventriculomegaly patterns may be associated with abnormal vasculature, including aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Baseline scans are critical to exclude animals with ventriculomegaly and AVM anomalies to ensure consistent and reliable animal models of CNS diseases.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nAnimal and Ventriculomegaly Rating Scale\nEight-week-old Wistar rats purchased from Charles River (n = 134, female) and Harlan Laboratories (n = 28, including 22 female and 6 male) were examined. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at our institution. Anatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAnatomical T 2weighted MRI was first applied to characterize each animal's baseline condition. Each animal's baseline brain MRI studies were reviewed independently by 3 investigators assessing the scans for any ventricular dilatation, asymmetrical ventricles, aqueduct stenosis, arachnoid cysts, cyst-like lesions, hyperintense lesions and otherwise unidentified bright objects. Animals without brain anomalies on baseline MRI were considered normal. The volume of ventricles or the hyperintense CSF compartments were quantified using National Institutes of Health ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) software and normalized to the volume of brain section at the same slices for cross comparison over each animal. A CSF compartment rating scale was applied to evaluate the ventricular and cystic abnormalities.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe inhalant anesthetic was delivered to the animal through a custom-made nose cone. Throughout MR scans, warm water was circulated under the animals to keep them warm at 37\u00b0C; a steady respiratory rate was monitored using a pressure sensor (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY), and maintained at 40 to 50 breaths/minute by isoflurane/oxygen mixture. For the baseline scan, high-resolution RARE MRI was first performed on every rat to acquire the anatomical T 2 -weighted images (TR 3.8 s, TE 15 ms, RARE factor 8, field of view [FOV] 2.56 \u00d7 2.56 [cm], matrix 256 \u00d7 256, in-plane resolution 100 \u00d7 100 [\u03bcm] with 0.5-mm thickness, number of excitation [NEX] 4, scan time 8 minutes).

The solvents used were \u03b3\u2010butyrolactone (BL), propylene carbonate (PC), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the salts included and . Cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes was correlated to their surface chemistry and morphology in the various solvent systems. The effects of both water and oxygen contamination were rigorously studied. It was found that the presence of oxygen in solutions considerably increased the cycling efficiency of the lithium electrode. This effect correlates well with the influence of the presence of oxygen on the surface morphology of lithium electrodes in solutions. The presence of water increases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in PC, and decreases cycling efficiency of Li electrodes in ethers. These results are discussed in light of the surface chemistry of lithium electrodes in the various solvent systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAfter cycling, the residual lithium was dissolved galvanostatically (same current density). We found that the initial deposition also has a limited efficiency which is quite similar to the average cycling efficiency. Therefore the average cycling efficiency could be calculated from the following equation X = [qe -(Xql -qr)/N]/qc  [1]  where 100X is the cycling efficiency (%), N is the number of cycles, qe, ql, and qr are the charges involved in a single deposition process (half cycle), initial loading (massive lithium deposition), and final diseharge (after cycling) respeetively. The potential of the working electrode (vs. Li/Li + reference electrode) was continuously reeorded during the whole experiment. The final dissolution process was interrupted when the working electrode potential exceeded 1V vs. Li/Li +. Typical measurements of working electrode potential changes during cycling efficiency experiments are illustrated in Fig.  2 .

An initial amount of lithium (several coulombs per cm 2) was deposited on a nickel or copper electrode. Then, 10-30% of this initial amount was discharged (Li dissolution) and recharged (Li deposition) periodically, galvanostatically. In most cases the number of cycles was 5-15 and the current density was 0.5 mA/cm 2 or 1 mA/cm 2, which is the same current density applied to lithium samples that were prepared for spectroscopic measurements.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAll the LiC104 salt solutions studied in this work have quite a poor lithium cycling efficiency. It should be noticed that the values of Table I are s o m e w h a t lower than cycling efficiency values of same solvents that appear in the literature  (20) (21) (22) . There are two major reasons for these differences: 1. The values of Table  I  were obtained from experiments in which lithium was deposited on nickel or copper substrates. Naturally, lithium deposition on a lithium substrate is expected to have a higher efficiency, since adherence of Li deposits to lithium substrate is better  (23) . 2. We found that in several solvent systems, cycling efficiency increases as electrolyte concentration increases  (24) . A m a x i m u m cycling efficiency of lithium electrode in PC-LiC104 was achieved at salt concentration around 1M (2O). In the present work, salt concentration in most of the experiments was around 0.5M, which is somewhat lower than the electrolyte concentrations where m a x i m a in cycling efficiency of lithium electrodes are achieved  (20, 21, 23) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A lithium-sulfur cell with a nanostructured anode is created with a high Coulombic efficiency and high capacity retention rate of 36.3% after 2000 cycles. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 25 ]  However, a large quantity of micro-sized Li dendrites is observed in case of plate Li metal anode while the nanostructured metallic Li anode is dendritefree when applying a huge current density of 10 mA cm -2 based on the surface of fl at electrode (Figure  3 e, f ). For plate Li metal electrode, the huge uptake of current results in strong local electrical fi eld and extremely high concentration gradient of Li ions as driven force for high throughput transportation of electrons from electrode and ions from electrolyte, which is benefi cial for the dendrite growth. While for the nanostructured metallic Li anode, its 3D nanostructure with abundant electrode/electrolyte interfaces lower the absolute local current density even though applying the same current as Li anode. Thus both the gradients of electrical fi eld and Li ion concentration at local regions are reduced to orders of magnitude towards increased Sand's time and dendritefree morphology.  [ 9, 30 ]  Also, due to the nanosized matrix, the growth of Li crystal is also self-restricted in principles shown in Figure  1  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, once the Li deposit initiates, it would grow continuously because Li deposit in the initial time is with a small size that holds a strong electric fi eld strength, thus favoring the adsorption and deposition of lithium ions (Figure  1 b ). When the Li deposit size is beyond that of the matrix, Li + adsorption and deposition ability of the deposits will be below the matrix and then Li + deposits on the matrix rather than on the dendrites continually. Thus, the nanostructured LiB alloy anode not only reduces the current density, which decreases the growth velocity of Li deposits, but also limits the fi nal size of deposited Li on the nanostructured matrix, which leads to the dendrite-free morphology at macroscale (Figure  1 c ). Consequently, the Li deposits on the nanostructured anode with metallic Li embeded in fi brous Li 7 B 6 matrix are always with smaller size than that on the plate Li metal anode.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhile nanostructured metallic Li electrodes shows regular polarization curves and much lower resistance, suggesting a stable and thin interface is formed on nanosized Li embedded in fi brous framework. This can be ascribed to lower concentration gradient of both Li ions and polysulfi des to suppress Li 2 S growing into bulk insulating phase. Consequently, the LiB electrode is highly considered to replace metallic Li anode in Li-S batteries for superior cell performance and stability. The 3D nanostructured anode with metallic Li contained in fi brous Li 7 B 6 matrix not only afford favorable interfacial stability and transfer properties, but also suppress the dendrite growth due to decreased areal current density and local small 2014, 10, No. 21, 4257-4263 concentration gradient of Li ions. Large Li dendrites are not available for both plate Li metal and nanostructured metallic Li electrodes at a low current density of 0.3 mA cm -2 , while the surface of plate Li metal is more coarse than nanostructured metallic Li anode (Figure  S1 ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Plasmonics -a rapidly emerging subdiscipline of nanophotonics -is aimed at exploiting both localized and propagating surface plasmons for technologically important applications, specifically in sensing and waveguiding. Here we present a brief overview of this rapidly growing research field. supported by single nanoparticles in particular have received considerable attention owing to numerous significant advances in nanoparticle synthesis. Wet chemical synthesis methods have now made it possible to fabricate plasmonic nanoparticles having a variety of shapes (for example spheres 9 , triangles 10 , prisms  11  , rods  12  and cubes  13  ) with controllable sizes and narrow size distributions.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFurthermore, metallic-dielectric and metallic-metallic core-shell nanoparticles and mixed metallic-alloy nanoparticles with different shapes (for example, nanoshells  [14] [15] [16]  and nanorice  17  ) have been prepared. Fabrication of this large variety of different structures makes a variety of applications possible, as the spectral position of the surface plasmon resonance depends on both the shape and the size of the nanoparticle. For spherical nanoparticles, a resonance of the oscillating electrons with an incident optical wave occurs when the negative of the real part of the particle's dielectric constant equals twice the value of the dielectric constant of the medium (see theoretical section below). However, for non-spherical particle shapes, the electron oscillation is non-isotropic and localized either along the principal axes  18  or at the edges and corners of the nanoparticle  19  (or both), leading to an additional shape-dependent depolarization and splitting of the surface plasmon resonance into several modes (such as longitudinal and transverse modes for nanorods or symmetric and antisymmetric modes in nanoshells  20  ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe polarizability shows a resonance when the denominator is minimized, which occurs when the magnitude of the real part of the complex dielectric function, \u03b5 real , is -2\u03b5 m . This resonance condition for the polarizability leads to a strong extinction of light at the plasmon resonance frequency. Within this free-electron description, plasmons can be thought of as collective oscillations of the conduction-band electrons induced by an interacting light wave. To determine the plasmon-resonant properties of arbitrarily shaped particles, solutions to Maxwell's equations must be obtained. For nanoparticles with a spherical symmetry, Mie scattering theory  21, 22  provides a rigorous solution that describes well the optical spectra of spheres of any size. To determine the extinction spectrum of a nanoparticle using Mie theory, the electromagnetic fields of the incident wave, scattered wave and the wave inside the particle are expressed as the sum of a series of vector spherical harmonic basis functions. The electromagnetic fields must then satisfy Maxwell's boundary conditions of continuity at the junction between the nanoparticle and the embedding medium. Mie theory is exact and accounts for field-retardation effects that become significant for particles whose size is comparable to the wavelength of light.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this work, we demonstrate that a plasmonic resonance in top-down nanofabricated yttrium antennas can be completely and reversibly turned on and off using hydrogen exposure. We fabricate arrays of yttrium nanorods and optically observe, in extinction spectra, the hydrogen-induced phase transition between the metallic yttrium dihydride and the insulating trihydride. Whereas the yttrium dihydride nanostructures exhibit a pronounced particle plasmon resonance, the transition to yttrium trihydride leads to a complete vanishing of the resonant behavior. The plasmonic resonance in the dihydride state can be tuned over a wide wavelength range by simply varying the size of the nanostructures. Furthermore, we develop an analytical diffusion model to explain the temporal behavior of the hydrogen loading and unloading trajectories observed in our experiments and gain information about the thermodynamics of our device. Thus, our nanorod system serves as a versatile basic building block for active plasmonic devices ranging from switchable perfect absorbers to active local heating control elements. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCatalytic materials such as platinum or palladium next to yttrium are necessary because yttrium itself is not able to catalytically dissociate H 2 molecules into atomic hydrogen. Additionally, the platinum cover prevents oxidation at the top surface of the yttrium rods. Such oxidation is common in transition metals like yttrium, which easily form an oxide layer (Y 2 O 3 ) of several nanometers when exposed to oxygen.  26  This impedes hydrogen from penetrating into the particle volume. Although the thin layer of platinum introduces some additional damping to our system, the overall influence on the plasmonic response is weak. Figure  2  shows typical extinction spectra of the different hydrogenation states of yttrium nanoantennas measured with a commercial Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy system (Bruker FTIR) and an incident electric field polarization parallel to the rods. Here, the rods have dimensions of 385 \u00d7 160 nm and a height of 50 nm yttrium plus 6 nm platinum.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDespite the advantage of much faster switching times, they can often be used only in hybrid plasmonic systems, that is, in combination with gold or other good plasmonic metals. However, the use of hybrid systems drastically lowers the switching contrast, since only the dielectric environment of the resonant material changes and not the antenna itself. Therefore, yttrium dihydride is a highly relevant and very promising alternative for plasmonic applications that require a high switching contrast and are less dependent on ultrashort switching times. Furthermore, as a metal, yttrium and its hydrides can be structured easily using standard nanofabrication techniques. During hydrogen absorption, metallic yttrium (Y) transforms first into yttrium dihydride (YH 2 , Figure  1a ), which has an even higher electrical conductivity than pure yttrium. This phase change from a metal in hcp configuration into a fcc metal is nonreversible under normal conditions. Through further exposure to hydrogen, it undergoes a second, reversible, phase change into yttrium trihydride (YH 3 , Figure  1b ), a transparent semiconductor with a hcp structure.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDue to its high refractive index, YH 3 could even act as high-index nanophotonic material (n \u2248 2.8 at 600 nm  31, 52  ) which supports electric and magnetic Mie resonances  53, 54  that can be switched on and off using hydrogen. Other transition metals such as vanadium  55  or scandium, or transition metal alloys like Mg-Y, Mg-La, Mg-Sc, and Mg-Gd may provide even faster response.

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I(1-x)Br(x))3 (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of \u03b3-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThird, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min (Fig.  1b ). As is apparent from Supplementary Fig.  1 , the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate (Supplementary Fig.  1a ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nEvaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions. Generally, \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL), N ,N -dimethylformamide, DMSO and N -methyl-2pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI. However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area \n20  , although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents. Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer  10  , and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO 2 base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process. Furthermore, it was reported that the uniformity of the perovskite films depended on the thickness of the TiO 2 compact layer, and modification of the spinning conditions could not achieve 100% surface coverage  20  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1a ). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 \u2022 C (Supplementary Fig.  1b ). Here, the crystallinity of the perovskite films is almost the same regardless of the toluene drop-casting, as can be seen in values of full-width at half-maximum of (110) XRD peaks of Supplementary Fig.  2 . Therefore, the solvent-engineering technique is critically important for this process. To gain further insight into the mixed-solvent application and subsequent toluene drip treatment, we isolated the intermediate phase formed by pouring MAI and PbI 2 dissolved in GBL and DMSO into toluene.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe standard data names for some common crystallographic software are provided in Table  1 . SHELX .fcf files are converted to mmCIF format and the space group is then inferred from the symmetry operators.\n\nModel building\nInitial building of protein structures from experimental phasing is usually accomplished by automated methods such as ARP/wARP, RESOLVE  (Wang et al., 2004)  and Buccaneer  (Cowtan, 2006) . However, most of these methods rely on a resolution of better than 2.5 A \u02daand yield more complete models the better the resolution. The main focus in Coot, therefore, is the completion of initial models generated by either molecular replacement or automated model building as well as building of lower resolution structures. However, the features described below are provided for cases where an initial model is not available.\n\nTools for general model building\n4.1.1. C a baton mode. Baton building, which was introduced by  Kleywegt & Jones (1994) , allows a protein main chain to be built by using a 3.8 A \u02da'baton' to position successive C atoms at the correct spacing.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPDB and mmCIF files are handled using the MMDB library  (Krissinel et al., 2004) , which is also used for internal model manipulations. 3.7.2. Electron density. The electron-density representation is a significant element of the design of the software. Coot employs a 'crystal space' representation of the electron density, in which the electron density is practically infinite in extent, in accordance with the lattice repeat and cell symmetry of the crystal. Thus, no matter where the viewpoint is located in space density can always be represented. This design decision is achieved by use of the Clipper libraries  (Cowtan, 2003) . The alternative approach is to just display electron density in a bounded box described by the input electron-density map. This approach is simpler and may be more appropriate in some specific cases (e.g. when displaying density from cryo-EM experiments or some types of NCS maps). However, it has the limitation that no density is available for symmetry-related molecules and if the initial map has been calculated with the wrong extent then it must be recalculated in order to view the desired regions.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe function is menu-driven and can produce any desired helical nucleic acid coordinates in PDB format with canonical Watson-Crick base pairing from a given input sequence with the click of a single button. Because most DNA and RNA structures are comprised of at least local regions of regular near-ideal helical structural elements, the ability to generate nucleic acid helical models on the fly is of particular value for molecular replacement. Recently, a collection of short ideal A-form RNA helical fragments generated within Coot were used to solve a structurally complex ligase ribozyme by molecular replacement  (Robertson & Scott, 2008) . Using Coot together with the powerful molecular-replacement program Phaser  (Storoni et al., 2004 ) not only permitted this novel RNA structure to be solved without resort to heavy-atom methods, but several other RNA and RNA/protein complexes were also subsequently determined using this approach  (Robertson & Scott, 2007) . Since Coot and Phaser can be scripted using embedded Python components, an automated and integrated phasing system is amenable for development within the current software framework. 4.1.7.

By combining two short perpendicularly polarized pulses with frequencies centered at \u03c91 and \u03c92, where (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92)/\u03c91 \u226a 1, we can create a pulse with polarization that sweeps from circular through linear back to circular. It is possible to make the duration of the segment of the pulse capable of emitting short-wavelength radiation so small that emission is possible only for a time less than the period of the fundamental. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAll dispersion characteristics of this filter are known, 8 and a 200.0-nmthick silver film will increase the pulse duration by a maximum of 0.1 fs. We emphasize that the conditions assumed above are experimentally feasible. Phase-related beams with frequencies co, and w) 2 can be selected from an ultrashort laser pulse. The 800-nm light was chosen because, at this wavelength, pulses with durations of only ten optical periods are now generated' 2 and amplified.1 2 Two frequency bands near awl and \u00a302 can be selected by use of standard techniques.  9  The bandwidth of the two components can easily be broad enough to permit the synthesized pulse to fall sufficiently in intensity before the linear polarization condition can reappear, thus ensuring that harmonic emission is very weak at all times except near t = 0. Measurement of the time duration of subfemtosecond pulses also seems feasible. Since it is as complex as the production process it will be addressed elsewhere.'  3  Our approach to attosecond pulse generation is a special case of a much more general phenomenon, namely, coherent control of strong-field atomic processes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSince the development of the laser, obtaining shorter and shorter pulses has been a major emphasis of laser science. To approach the limit of 10 fs, at which short-pulse lasers currently operate,\" 2 nonresonant (Kerr) nonlinearities are used. However, the development of short-pulse coherent sources of less than 1-fs duration will require shorter-wavelength radiation and a new nonlinearity. In this Letter we introduce a method for producing pulses with durations approaching 1 atomic unit of time based on highharmonic emission from atomic gases.\nHigh harmonics have been extensively studied.  3  Their discrete nature and broad envelope spectrum implies that, if the harmonics are appropriately phased, a train of very short (-10 as) pulses separated by one half of the fundamental period will result.  4  In analogy with lasers, it is not sufficient to have equally spaced modes of an oscillator; they must be locked in the appropriate relative phase. Aside from phase-matching issues, the harmonic emission of a quantum system is determined by the squared modulus of the second time derivative of the dipole moment. Therefore the problem is to find the dipole moment as a function of time.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1(a) . The time dependence of the instantaneous emission frequency is chirped, just as described for the individual pulses in Fig.  1(a) . It is not sufficient to fabricate a subfemtosecond pulse; we must ensure that the pulse will emerge undistorted from the nonlinear medium and the filter. In the medium there are two issues of concern, i.e., group-velocity and phase-velocity dispersion. In experiments on high-harmonic generation there are two main sources of phase-velocity dispersion: (1)  the phase advance that is due to the focusing geometry of the incident laser and (2) the dispersion in the laser-produced plasma.\" Whereas in principle the first problem is technical, the second problem is unavoidable; the high laser intensities necessary for efficient high-harmonic generation always lead to ionization. Indeed, the two are inherently related. We now show that, if the phase-matching condition is satisfied, no significant increase in the duration of the ultrashort pulse will occur. In low-density plasmas the refractive index is n(fl) = 1 -copl 2 /2f 2 , where 0 is the optical frequency in question.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage size of 3.8 nm and the highest pore volume of 2.8 cm(3) g(-1) among reported Zr-MOFs. Moreover, PCN-777 shows excellent stability in aqueous environments, which makes it an ideal candidate as a support to incorporate different functional moieties. Through facile internal surface modification, the interaction between PCN-777 and different guests can be varied to realize efficient immobilization. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nmechanical and the chemical stability of the framework decrease gradually. \n[3]  Furthermore, the working environments of those immobilized moieties are usually harsh, which requires the frameworks to be chemically very stable. The requirement of a combination of good chemical stability and large pores means that very few candidates are widely utilized. MIL-101 and MIL-100 are two extraordinary examples that exhibit both properties and are suitable supports.  [4]  MIL-100 and MIL-101, both of which have zeotype mtn topology (zeotype refers to structures sharing the same topology with zeolites), contain super-tetrahedral cages to substitute for the tetrahedral unit in zeolites.  [5]  Hence, their largest pores reach 31\u00c5 and 29\u00c5 respectively although the organic linkers are relatively small. Moreover, the metal nodes in these MOFs are based on trivalent metal species. The strong interaction between carboxylates and high valent metal species accompanied with the small organic linker endows these frameworks with excellent chemical stability. Despite these advantages, the pore size still restricts further application of these MOFs when it comes to larger guests such as nanoparticles or enzymes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTherefore, synthesis of mesoporous materials with larger pore size which also maintain excellent chemical stability is highly desired. Application of a ligand larger than those in the MIL-100 and MIL-101 MOFs to create zeotype frameworks would be an effective way to generate extra-large pores, while avoiding complicated organic synthesis to make the linker extremely large. Unfortunately, there are several challenges in the way of extending these mtn topological MOFs: First, the M 3 O(COO) 6 (M= Fe(III), Al(III), Cr(III), In(III), V(III), Sc(III)) building block is not the thermodynamically favored form, which makes the controllable formation of target products difficult;  [6]  second, even if the inorganic building block can be obtained, competitive framework isomers, such as the MIL-88 structure, still dominate as the major products; moreover, most of the synthesis needs to be conducted under hydrothermal conditions, which is infeasible for large organic linkers with poor water solubility. Therefore, searching for other zeotype frameworks, which can be synthetically controlled more easily, is one promising strategy.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThrough a topological analysis, we herein present a zeotype mesoporous Zr-MOF, namely PCN-777, which has the \u03b2-cristobalite type structure. PCN-777 exhibits the largest cage (3.8nm) and the highest porosity (2.8cm 3 /g) among all the reported Zr-MOFs. Moreover, it shows high stability in aqueous solution with a wide range of pH values. Zirconium MOFs have been extensively studied recently due to their excellent chemical stability.  [7]  One major reason is the controllable synthesis of crystalline product or even single crystals by using competing reagents.  [8]  Moreover, the symmetry of a Zr 6 cluster ( Zr 6 O 4 OH 4 (COO) 12 ) fully coordinated by 12 carboxylates is O h , which has many high symmetry subgroups. This means that it is possible to reduce the connectivity and symmetry of Zr 6 to make it compatible with almost all kinds of organic linkers and form three dimensional (3-D) periodic frameworks.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

By using \u03b1-Fe2O3/Ppy as the anode materials with iron foil as the current collector, the unique structure affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/diintercalation for Li-ion battery. A relatively high specific capacity of 0.42 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at 0.1 mA/cm2 even after 100 charge/discharge cycles, with a plateau potential of 1 V and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, suggesting the feasibility to use this unique 3D nanostructured hybrid composite for microbattery in both small and large scale applications. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe appearance of the strong peak at 1590 cm \u00c01 , weak peaks at 982 cm \u00c01 and 930 cm \u00c01 , which are assigned to C =C backbone stretching and ring-in plane deformation of PPY, respectively, indicating the successful polymerization of polypyrrole  [16] .

To evaluate the electrochemical behavior, coin cells based on self-supported a-Fe 2 O 3 /Ppy composites, without using binder and additional conductive additives, were assembled against a lithium metal counter electrode and subjected to galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling as well as cyclic voltammetry testing.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt affords a highly conductive pathway for electron, a short ion diffusion length for ions, a fast mass transport channel for electrolyte, and sufficient void space among neighboring nanoflakes for accommodating large volume variations during Li intercalation/disintercalation when serve as anode for Li-ion battery  [3, 5]  Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) further confirm the presence of Ppy, a-Fe 2 O 3 and a small amount of Fe 3 O 4 in the nanoflakes.

The nanoflakes are separated by distance in the range of 60-300 nm. A thin Ppy film is uniformly deposited onto the surface a-Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes array, forming a conformal coating around each nanoflakes without any coalescence between them (Figure  2d ).

However, catalytic application of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) for Suzuki coupling of aryl chlorides is still a challenge. Here, we design a novel catalyst by combining Pd NPs with Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocrystals for Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling of aryl chlorides. This nanocatalyst demonstrated good activity (yield 86.2% at 80 \u00b0C), high TOF, great stability, easy separation, excellent reusability (initial rates were not reduced after five cycles) and low cost in Suzuki reactions. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe whole reaction process was carried out at room temperature with agitated stirring. After 10 min, the reaction was aged at room temperature without any interruption for 24 h.

Synthesis of Pd-Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 microspheres 0.01 g of Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 was dissolved in 20 mL water solution. 10 mL palladium chloride water solution (1 g L -1 ) was slowly added into the above mixture solution at 30 \u00b0C in 10 min with vigorous magnetic stirring, followed by the addition of 5 mL EtOH. About four hours later, the solid products were collected by centrifugation and were washed with water several times. The products were dried under vacuum. The solid product was dissolved in concentrated nitric acid and analyzed by using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) to determine the content of Pd (47.9 wt%).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs shown in Fig.  5a  and 5b , the adsorption and desorption isotherms of Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 and Pd-Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 are also quite similar. The adsorption isotherms display steep nitrogen gas uptake at low relative pressures (P/P 0 < 0.001) reflecting abundant micropore structure, a slight hysteresis loop implying a spot of mesopore and a sharp rise at medium and high pressure regions (P/P 0 = 0.8-1.0) indicating the size of MOF. The pore size distribution of Co 3 [Co-(CN) 6 ] 2 and Pd-Co 3 [Co(CN) 6 ] 2 can be obtained from the supplied results by using the sorption apparatus, as shown in Fig.  5c  and 5d .

Herein, a highly active and stable electrocatalyst of MoC encapsulated by graphitized carbon shells (nanoMoC@GS) has been developed via an in situ carburization of a Mo-based metal\u2013organic framework (Mo-MOF) with the atomic periodic structure. The ultrafine MoC nanoparticles (\u223c3 nm) confined by 1\u20133 layered graphite shells significantly favor the efficient HER in both acidic and basic media. In particular, a low overpotential (\u03b710 = 124 and 77 mV at a current density of \u221210 mA cm\u22122), a small Tafel slope (43 and 50 mV dec\u22121) and a high exchange current density (j0 = 0.015 and 0.212 mA cm\u22122) are achieved on nanoMoC@GS in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Such remarkable activity, outperforming most current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, stems from the cooperative/synergistic effects of ultrafine MoC nanostructure, ultrathin and conductive graphitized carbon shells, and enriched porosity. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high-performance electrocatalysts via converting \u201catomic contact\u201d hybrid structures (e.g., MOFs), illustrating a new perspective for developing nanocatalysts in the energy chemistry field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe lowest R ct value for nanoMoC@GS(700) might result from its relatively large quantity of graphitized carbon (Table  S1  \u2020). EIS for nanoMoC@GS(700) at various HER overpotentials from 75 to 200 mV in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 is provided in Fig.  S7 . \u2020 The corresponding Nyquist and Bode plots of the EIS response of nanoMoC@GS(700) are given in Fig.  6b , and two peaks could be detected in the curves. The \ue103rst one with potential-dependent properties at low frequencies could be attributed to kinetics of the HER process; while another at high frequencies with the same intensity suggested that this electrocatalyst processed an abundant porosity,  13  which was in agreement with N 2 -sorption experimental results. It has been widely demonstrated that different electrocatalysts have varying optimal mass loadings for HER.  15, 16, 20  The optimal mass loading of nanoMoC@GS(700) was also investigated. Results (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n8c  and S9 \u2020) and a small R ct of 34.8 (Fig.  S10 \u2020 ) at 125 mV, suggesting that this electrocatalyst also possessed a large ECSA and faster electron transfer rates in basic media. Notably, Pt/C showed an overwhelming advantage in acidic media, while the HER activity of nanoMoC@GS(700) even exceeded that of Pt/C at the high overpotential (>125 mV) in basic media. This interesting result was ascribed to different reaction pathways for the two catalysts, which were re\ue104ected by the different Tafel slope (77 mV dec \u00c01 for Pt/C and 50 mV dec \u00c01 for nanoMoC@GS) in Fig.  8b .  15  Additionally, the Nyquist and Bode plots of the EIS response for nanoMoC@GS(700) were depicted in Fig.  8d , and the peak at high frequencies also demonstrated the enriched porosity of this catalyst.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nS6 . \u2020 NanoMoC@GS(700) structure and particle size distribution of the MoC nanoparticles showed only slight changes, con\ue103rming the superior stability of this electrocatalyst, which resulted from the con\ue103ned geometry (ultra\ue103ne MoC nanoparticles encapsulated by graphitized carbon shells) in this material. We then used EIS to provide further insight into electrode kinetics of the obtained materials. As shown in Fig.  6a , nano-MoC@GS(700) presented a much lower charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) value (14.5 U) than nanoMoC@GS(800) (28.6 U) and nanoMoC@GS(900) (69.5 U), indicating a faster electron transfer rate in the HER process. This lower R ct should be related to the con\ue103ned geometry in nanoMoC@GS materials, which would enhance the close interface contract of MoC nanoparticles with the ultrathin graphitized carbon shell and allow rapid charge transfer kinetics during the electrochemical process by improving the conductivity of electrocatalysts.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Inhibitors that target the EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinases show therapeutic effects against LADCs containing EGFR gene mutations and ALK gene fusions, respectively. Recently, we and others identified the RET fusion gene as a new targetable driver gene in LADC. The RET fusions occur in 1-2% of LADCs. Existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of RET tyrosine kinase show promising therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as in a few patients.

LADC occurs both in smokers and non-smokers, and its incidence is increasing. \n(1)  Genome analyses of LADC show that these tumors contain distinct genetic alterations that activate oncogenes.  (2, 3)  Genetic alterations that result in the activation of several oncogenes are detected in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig.  1 ); of the hundreds of genes mutated in each case of LADC, these oncogenes are considered to be \"driver genes\".

This is possible using conjugate-gradient techniques for energy minimization, and predicting the wave functions for new ionic positions using subspace alignment. This approach avoids the instabilities inherent in quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations for metals based on the use of a fictitious Newtonian dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity and allows us to perform simulations over several picoseconds. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nIn recent years, ab initio calculations based on the local density approximation (LDA) (for a recent review see, for example, Ref.  [1] ) have been of increased interest. The reasons for this development are evident: LDA offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy and efficiency in treating electronic many-body effects, is completely parameterfree, and with the enormous increase in computer power complex calculations are now feasible. Using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem  [2] , the calculation of forces is in principle straight forward and, for a basis set such as plane waves, relatively simple. The forces offer the possibility of relaxing atoms into their ground-state or of performing ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. With the computers now available, calculations for systems containing more than 100 particles are practicable, and the development of faster parallel computers offers a bright future for ab initio techniques. We have recently implemented a powerful LDA plane wave program (Vienna ab initio molecular dynamics simulation package (VAMP) -for a detailed description see Ref.  [3] ) which can be used to perform complex calculations for many problems (i.e., bulk, surfaces, liquid systems, molecules).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCurrently, several calculations for surfaces, molecules, molecular crystals and liquid and amorphous alloys are under progress. Despite the advantages of the LDA-PW approach, there still remains one unsolved problem, i.e., the o(N 3) scaling with the number of atoms, N. Using PWs no solution to this problem seems to be possible. At the moment, only simple non-self-consistent tight-binding calculations promise to show an o(N)-scaling in the density-matrix formulation  [41] . Nevertheless, in terms of accuracy and because there are several ambiguous parameters these techniques are not comparable with LDA-PW calculations.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis is possible by extrapolating from finite-temperature to zero-temperature results  [18] , using E(T~ O) = (E+F)/2. In this case, the smearing parameter can be increased by an order of magnitude (for instance up to 1 eV for A1).\n\nIteratice diagonalization\nWithin each self-consistency loop, the wavefunctions are improved using an iterative matrix diagonalization scheme. We have tested the Davidson block-iteration scheme  [19]  and a method based on the band-by-band conjugate gradient techniques  [11, 20]  and have found that the conjugate gradient scheme is of superior efficiency. In addition, it requires less storage than the Davidson block-iteration scheme. In our implementation we closely follow Bylander et al.  [20] : starting from the lowest band, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (4'. I HI ~)n)/(~) n I~n) is minimized sequentially for each band n under the usual orthonormality constraint with two or three standard conjugate gradient steps (more steps are not efficient, because the update of the charge density changes the Hamiltonian).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

At first, however, they could only produce a few hundred angstroms of GaAs per day, grown in layers that were too thin to accurately characterize. Over at IBM, meanwhile, Leo Esaki and Ray Tsu were grappling with a theoretical concept known as a superlattice. Whereas the heterostructures proposed by Kroemer contained just two layers of different materials, superlattices could be made of many very thin layers of two or more different semiconductors. Moreover, if a superlattice could be built with layers that were shorter than the mean free path of the electrons, a series of allowed and forbidden energy bands would be created in the device. Esaki and Tsu argued that this could prove to be \"a valuable area of investigation in the field of semiconductors\"  10  . However, when they submitted their first paper on this topic to a journal, it was rejected on the grounds that it was too speculative with \"no new physics\". (The first paper on the STM was rejected for similar reasons 2 .) Luckily for Esaki and Tsu the Army Research Office thought differently and supported their superlattice research for several years.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nincrementally improved MBE technology, introducing refinements such as computer-controlled shutter systems and in situ monitoring.\n\nAN MBE COMMUNITY EMERGES\nOne of the young experimentalists attracted to MBE was Arthur C. Gossard, who arrived at Bell Labs in 1960 after getting his doctorate in physics from Berkeley. At first he continued to study ferromagnetic and superconducting materials with nuclear and electron resonance techniques. Around 1973, however, managers at Bell Labs encouraged him to study defects in semiconductors, especially those used for laser applications. It was the need to fabricate samples for this research that led him to MBE. However, managers initially discouraged him, saying that MBE was too complex for a neophyte to take on. Within a few years, however, Gossard's small group was publishing papers describing the nanoscale semiconductor structures they had built with their rudimentary equipment  12  . By the late 1970s, Gossard's team, like researchers at other labs, were experimenting with a technique that became known as modulation doping (Fig.  2 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2 ). By carefully controlling the introduction of source materials into the MBE chamber, researchers could implant dopants at precise locations in the semiconductor nanostructure they were fabricating. And by cleverly mixing doped with updoped layers, they could tune the structure and composition of the material and vary its electrical properties. The design and fabrication of new semiconductor materials by MBE has been described by Federico Capasso, another former Bell Lab researcher, as \"bandgap engineering\". As the research community became big enough to support dedicated MBE conferences, commercial firms began to pay attention. By the early 1980s, firms like Riber offered the first off-the-shelf MBE systems, which helped make the technique even more accessible. After a decade of incremental improvements and refinements, a fully fledged instrumental community had coalesced around MBE and its ability to fabricate nanostructured materials. Today, there are hundreds of MBE machines in use at university and industry labs throughout the world, with a typical machine costing around a million dollars. Away from the research lab, scaled-up MBE machines produce semiconductor structures for lasers that are found in hundreds of millions of compact disk and DVD players.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Ordered mesoporous structures with tunable pore sizes are obtained with various precursors, different acids as pH adjustors, and different block copolymers as templates. These mesoporous aluminas have large surface areas (ca. 400 m2/g), pore volumes (ca. 0.70 cm3/g), and narrow pore-size distributions. The influence of the complexation ability of anions and hydro-carboxylic acid, acid volatility, and other important synthesis conditions are discussed in detail. Utilizing this simple strategy, we also obtained partly ordered mesoporous alumina with hydrous aluminum nitrate as the precursor. FTIR pyridine adsorption measurements indicate that a large amount of Lewis acid sites exist in these mesoporous aluminas. These materials are expected to be good candidates in catalysis due to the uniform pore structures, large surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and large amounts of surface Lewis acid sites. Loaded with ruthenium, the representative mesoporous alumina exhibits reactant size selectivity in hydrogenation of acetone, D-glucose, and D-(+)-cellobiose as a test reaction, indicating the potential applications in shape-selective catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCatalyst Preparation. Supported ruthenium catalysts containing 2 wt % ruthenium were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of as-synthesized mesoporous Al2O3 and for comparison, commercial Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar) with an aqueous solution of Ru(NO)(NO3) (Alfa Aesar) (denoted hereinafter as ruthenium/meso-Al2O3 and ruthenium/ commerical-Al2O3, respectively) at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h. Impregnated samples were dried in ambient air at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h and then reduced under flowing H2/N2 (10/90 v/v) at 350 \u00b0C for 6 h. Characterization. PXRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-2000 diffractometer (Japan) using Cu KR radiation (\u03bb ) 1.5406 \u00c5). TEM were taken on the Hitachi H-9000 NAR transmission electron microscope under a working voltage of 300 kV.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThen 1.4-1.6 mL of 67 wt % nitric acid (or 1.4-1.6 mL of 37 wt % hydrochloric acid plus 0.5 g citric acid) and 2.04 g (10 mmol) of aluminum iso-propoxide were added into the above solution with vigorous stirring. The mixture was covered with PE film, stirred at room temperature for about 5 h, and then put into a 60 \u00b0C drying oven to undergo the solvent evaporation process. After 2 days of aging, the solution became a light-yellow solid (when hydrochloric acid and citric acid were used, white solids were obtained). Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0C min -1 ramping rate) and by heating at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. High-temperature treatment was carried out in air for 1 h with a temperature ramp of 10 \u00b0C min -1 . Catalyst Preparation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIntroduction\nSince the ordered mesoporous silica material was first reported in 1992, 1 the interest in this research field has expanded all over the world due to the potential applications of these materials in catalysis and in other realms of chemistry. Compared to silica, alumina is more popular in catalysis area for its broad applications as industrial catalysts and catalyst supports employed in petroleum refinement, automobile emission control, and others.  2  With the characteristics of mesoporous materials, such as highly uniform channels, large surface area, narrow pore-size distribution, tunable pore sizes over a wide range, and so on, alumina with a mesostructure should possess much more excellent properties. Nonsiliceous materials with ordered mesoporosity are commonly prepared through the sol-gel process with surfactants as structure-directing agents (SDAs) or by utilizing the nanocasting method with silica or carbon materials as hard templates. However, the synthesis of ordered and thermal stable mesopo-rous alumina represents a much more complex problem  3  due to its susceptibility for hydrolysis as well as to the phase transitions accompanying the thermal breakdown of the ordered structure.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The 4th edition of the WHO classification incorporates new information that has emerged from scientific and clinical studies in the interval since the publication of the 3rd edition in 2001, and includes new criteria for the recognition of some previously described neoplasms as well as clarification and refinement of the defining criteria for others. It also adds entities-some defined principally by genetic features-that have only recently been characterized. In this paper, the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia is highlighted with the aim of familiarizing hematologists, clinical scientists, and hematopathologists not only with the major changes in the classification but also with the rationale for those changes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSignificant changes in the diagnosis and classification of MDS\n\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia and related precursor neoplasms\nThe previous edition of the WHO classification ushered in the era of incorporation of genetic abnormalities into diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of AML. The 4 abnormalities initially included in the subgroup \"AML with recurring genetic abnormalities\" involved rearrangements of genes (RUNX1, CBFB, RARA, and MLL) that encode transcription factors and that are associated with fairly distinct clinical and morphologic features. Since the publication of the 3rd edition of the classification, it has become more widely appreciated that multiple genetic lesions-including not only microscopically detectable chromosomal rearrangements or numerical abnormalities but also submicroscopic gene mutations-cooperate to establish the leukemic process and influence its morphologic and clinical characteristics.  76  Although rearrangements of genes that encode transcription factors may lead to impaired maturation of one or more myeloid lineages, mutations of genes such as FLT3, JAK2, RAS, or KIT that encode proteins involved in signal transduction pathways may be required for the proliferation and/or survival of the neoplastic clone.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAssessment of blast lineage\nMultiparameter flow cytometry (at least 3 colors) is recommended; panel should be sufficient to determine lineage as well as aberrant antigen profile of neoplastic population. Cytochemistry, such as myeloperoxidase or nonspecific esterase, may be helpful, particularly in AML, NOS, but it is not essential in all cases. IHC on biopsy may be helpful; many antibodies are now available for recognition of myeloid and lymphoid antigens.\n\nAssessment of genetic features\nComplete cytogenetic analysis from BM at initial diagnosis when possible. Additional studies, such as FISH, RT-PCR, mutational status, should be guided by clinical, laboratory, and morphologic information. Mutational studies for mutated NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 are recommended in all cytogenetically normal AML; mutated JAK2 should be sought in BCR-ABL1-negative MPN, and mutational analysis for KIT, NRAS, PTNP11, etc, should be performed as clinically indicated.\n\nCorrelation/reporting of data\nAll data should be assimilated into one report that states the WHO diagnosis.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause mutated FLT3 frequently accompanies other genetic lesions, including well-recognized abnormalities such as the t(15;17)(q22;q12) and the t(6;9)(p23;q34), it is not included as a defining criterion for any distinct entity in this revision. Nevertheless, because of its prognostic importance, the mutational status of FLT3 should always be ascertained in AML, particularly in cytogenetically normal AML. AML with multilineage dysplasia was initially introduced in the WHO classification to encompass cases of AML characterized by MDS-like features, including unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, overexpression of multidrug-resistance glycoprotein, and an unfavorable response to therapy. Dysplasia in at least 50% of the cells in 2 or more hematopoietic lineages was used as a surrogate marker for these MDS-related biologic features. Although the prognostic significance of AML with multilineage dysplasia has been verified in some studies,  [89] [90] [91]  others showed that morphologic multilineage dysplasia had no independent prognostic significance when cytogenetic findings were incorporated in the analysis.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The theory generalizes previous treatments of the effects of gain and openness described by the Petermann factor. The linewidth is expressed using quantities based on the nonlinear scattering matrix, which can be computed from steady-state ab initio laser theory; unlike previous treatments, no passive cavity or phenomenological parameters are involved. We find that low cavity quality factor, combined with significant dielectric dispersion, can cause substantial deviations from the Shawlow-Townes-Petermann theory. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe third correction and the main focus of this Letter is the Petermann factor, K. First discovered in the context of transverse gain-guided semiconductor lasers  [4]  and subsequently generalized  [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , this factor arises from the non-Hermitian nature of the laser wave equation, due to the presence of the gain medium as well as the openness of the laser cavity (i.e. spatially non-uniform outcoupling loss). It always leads to an enhancement of the linewidth, even with uniform gain and no gain-guiding. Typically, it is calculated from the non-orthogonal passive cavity resonances as K = dr |\u03d5(r)| 2 dr \u03d5(r) 2 2 , (2) where the integrals are taken over the cavity  [11] . In effect, the Petermann factor changes the ST linewidth by the replacement \u03b3 2 c \u2192 K\u03b3 2 c . This is a significant correction for lasers with large outcoupling, in the range 1.1-1.6 for the conventional semiconductor lasers studied in Ref.  [2] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[2] . We shall refer to the standard theory, inclusive of the Petermann factor, as the Schawlow-Townes-Petermann (STP) theory. The extensive and impressive literature on the Petermann factor  [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 12 ] has, with one major exception  [9] , only treated single-mode lasing near threshold, neglecting the effects of spatial hole-burning. And apart from a recent paper by Schomerus  [12] , the literature has exclusively treated one-dimensional or waveguide lasers, and thus is not directly applicable to the wide variety of complex laser cavities developed during the past twenty years, such as microdisk and deformed-disk, photonic crystal, and random lasers. In this Letter, we derive a general formula for the intrinsic laser linewidth in arbitrary cavities, which is valid far from threshold, with strong spatial hole-burning, and in the multimode regime.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe zero-point contributions to \u03b8 i (t 1 )\u03b8 i (t 2 ) from the photon input and the gain medium cancel exactly, leaving FIG.  2:  (color online) Laser linewidth vs. inverse modal output power 1/P , for the two lasers studied in Fig.  1 .

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n5a ). Trinity performed well across a range of 10M to the full 150M input sequence reads, while the alternative methods tended to peak at ~50M pairs or smaller inputs (Supplementary Fig.  6a online ). In mouse (RefSeq annotation set, Fig.  5b ), Trinity (8185 transcripts, 7749 genes) outperformed the other de novo assembly methods ABySS (5561, 5500), Trans-ABySS (7025, 6598) and SOAPdenovo (761, 760), with the mapping-first programs Cufflinks (9010, 8536) and Scripture (9086, 8293) exhibiting better sensitivity. Furthermore, Trinity and Cufflinks appear best-tuned in their sensitivity across the broadest range of expression levels (Supplementary Fig.  7 online ). Unlike Trinity, several of the de novo methods did not perform well in fully reconstructing transcripts within the highest expression quintiles (Supplementary Fig.  7 online ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nRefSeq transcript gene annotations were downloaded for mouse at the UCSC mouse genome browser gateway ( http:// genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=mm9 ) in BED format. Protein coding nucleotide sequences were extracted from the genome sequences based on the gene annotations using custom PERL scripts. The mouse reference coding sequences were further distilled to remove entirely identical sequences corresponding to isoforms encoding identical proteins and paralogous sequences: the original 19,947 genes encoding 23,881 transcripts were reduced to 19,857 genes encoding 22,717 on-identical coding transcripts. Reconstructed transcript sequences (via de novo assembly, Scripture, or Cufflinks) were mapped to the reference coding sequences using BLAT  35  . Full-length reference annotation mappings were defined as having at least 95% sequence identity covering the entire reference coding sequence and containing at most 5% insertions or deletions (cumulative gap content). In evaluating methods that leverage the strand-specific data (Trinity and Cufflinks), proper sense-strand mapping of sequences was required. Transcripts reconstructed by the alternative methods (Scripture, ABySS, and SOAPdenovo) were allowed to map to either strand.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe evaluated Trinity on data from two well-annotated species -one microorganism (fission yeast) and one mammal (mouse) -as well as an insect (the whitefly Bemisia tabaci), whose genome has not yet been sequenced. In each case, Trinity recovers most of the reference (annotated) expressed transcripts as full-length sequences, and resolves alternative isoforms and duplicated genes, performing better than other available transcriptome de novo assembly tools, and comparably to methods relying on genome alignments.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nTrinity: a method for de novo transcriptome assembly\nTrinity is a modular method and software package, combining three components (Fig.  1 ): Inchworm, Chrysalis and Butterfly. In contrast to de novo assembly of a genome, where few large connected sequence graphs can represent connectivities among reads across entire chromosomes, in assembling transcriptome data we expect to encounter numerous individual disconnected graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at nonoverlapping loci. Accordingly, Trinity partitions the sequence data into these many individual graphs, and then processes each graph independently to extract full-length isoforms and tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify (1) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., areas of natural \"resistance\" to bleaching) and (2) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred (i.e., areas of natural community \"resilience\"). These \"target areas,\" where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus,  Salm et al. (2001)  have proposed that through thoughtful planning and strategic care of reefs within existing and future marine protected areas (MPAs)*, it may be possible to take advantage in two broad ways of the natural properties of coral reef ecosystems to mitigate the negative impact of bleaching on coral reef biodiversity: (1) Identify and manage specific patches of reef where local conditions are likely to result in reduced temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., coral assemblages with a high level of \"resistance\") to protect them from direct anthropogenic impacts. (2) Enhance the capacity for coral reef recovery (\"resilience\") by maintaining conditions optimal for larval dispersal and recruitment to damaged sites (requires minimizing other stresses at these sites [abatement of direct localized impacts] and analyzing larval dispersal [connectivity] to maximize recolonization). An understanding of which local environmental factors are predictors of greatest resistance and resilience to coral bleaching would help managers identify, design, and manage networks of MPAs in order to maximize overall survival of the world's coral reefs in the face of global climate change.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe most useful approach would be one that utilizes natural processes rather than expensive technological fixes and helps managers focus local management and enforcement efforts on the most criti-cal areas. Given the limited capacity and funding available for management in many coral-reef countries, what is especially needed are simple tractable strategies that any manager could begin to adopt immediately to maximize long-term survival of the broadest range of coral communities and reef types. We confine our discussion to local-scale resistance that occurs despite the presence of \"mass bleaching conditions\" in an area or region. This resistance is distinct from avoidance, in which large areas or regions may never be tested by bleaching conditions at all due to larger-scale climatological and oceanographic phenomena  ( Done 2001 ) . Although the latter is an important area of ongoing research, here we focus on determinants of local-scale resistance within areas or regions that have experienced bleaching conditions, because this is an important scale at which local managers work. Therefore, building on the work of  Salm et al.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDone ( 2001 )  emphasized the importance of targeting for MPA inclusion strategic locations that maximize both strong and reliable recruitment of all species within the community and the likelihood that a portion of the propagules from those communities will effectively seed other areas. In this sense, communities with diverse populations of adult corals with high fertilization success and robust larvae (which will survive, recruit, and grow successfully) can contribute not only to their own resilience but to the resilience of other \"downstream\" communities as well. Coral reef resilience also depends on other biological components of reef communities ( i.e., a requisite variety of functional groups)  (Gunderson 2000) . For example,  Bythell et al. ( 2000 )  studied the effects of natural mortality events resulting from hurricanes at Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. They attributed the resilience of their study reefs to the presence of sufficient grazing fish populations, which kept in check the growth of macroalgae that may otherwise have out-competed coral recruits for space ( see also  Rogers 2000) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The voom method estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear modeling and gene set testing methods. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe summarized read count data is available from the voom webpage  [56] . The voom mean-variance trend shown in Figure  1a  was obtained from all 16 libraries, treated as four groups. Genes were filtered out if they failed to achieve cpm > 1 in at least four libraries, and the remaining log-cpm values were quantile normalized between libraries  [61] . The comparison between technical replicates to check the type I error rate control used only the four group B libraries. Genes were filtered out if they failed to achieve a cpm > 1 in at least two libraries and the log-cpm values for the 16,745 remaining genes were quantile normalized. Samples were separated into all possible two-versus-two and three-versus-one combinations and a limma analysis using voom weights was carried out for each partition. The false discovery rate analysis was conducted on the spike-in transcripts only. ERCC Mixes 1 and 2 contain 92 transcripts spiked in at different concentrations. For this analysis, fragments were mapped to the known sequences of the spiked-in transcripts using Subread.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWhen the sequencing depths are different, voom is the clear best performer. Either voom or limma-trend give RNA-seq analysts immediate access to many techniques developed for microarrays that are not otherwise available for RNAseq, including all the quality weighting, random effects and gene set testing techniques mentioned above. This article presents two case studies that demonstrate how voom can handle heterogeneous data and complex experiments as well as facilitating pathway analysis and gene set testing.\n\nResults\n\n\nCounts per million: a simple interpretable scale for assessing differential expression\nWe suppose that RNA-seq profiles (or libraries) are available for a set of n RNA samples. Each profile records the number of sequence reads from that sample that have been mapped to each one of G genomic features. A genomic feature can be any predefined subset of the transcriptome, for example a transcript, an exon or a gene. For simplicity, we will assume throughout this article that reads have been summarized by gene, so that the RNA-seq profiles give the number of reads from each sample that have been mapped to each gene. Typically G is large, in the tens of thousands or more, whereas n can be as low as three.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIf the genomic length of each gene is known, then the log-cpm values output by voom can be converted to log-rpkm by subtracting the log 2 gene length in kilobases. The downstream analysis is unchanged and will yield identical results in terms of differentially expressed genes and estimated fold-changes. This article has shown that a normal-based analysis of RNA-seq read count data performs surprisingly well relative to methods that use special-purpose count distributions. The motivation for examining normal-based methods was to open up access to a range of microarraylike analysis tools based on the normal distribution. From this point of view, the normal-based methods only need to perform comparably to the count-based methods in terms of power and FDR control in order to be a success.

To identify the genetic alterations in this tumor type, we searched for copy number alterations using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and microRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 MBs. We found that, on average, each tumor had 11 gene alterations, fewer by a factor of 5 to 10 than in the adult solid tumors that have been sequenced to date. In addition to alterations in the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, our analysis led to the discovery of genes not previously known to be altered in MBs. Most notably, inactivating mutations of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase genes MLL2 or MLL3 were identified in 16% of MB patients. These results demonstrate key differences between the genetic landscapes of adult and childhood cancers, highlight dysregulation of developmental pathways as an important mechanism underlying MBs, and identify a role for a specific type of histone methylation in human tumorigenesis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFourth, it is possible that low copy number gains or loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of specific regions containing histone-modifying genes could mimic the intragenic mutations that we observed  (36) . Finally, it is possible that heritable epigenetic alterations are responsible for initiating some MBs. The last explanation, involving covalent changes in chromatin proteins and DNA, is intriguing given the new data on MLL2 in this tumor type. It should thus be informative to characterize the methylation status of histones and DNA in MBs with and without MLL2/MLL3 gene alterations, as well as to determine the expression changes resulting from these gene mutations. These data highlight the important connection between genetic alterations in the cancer genome and epigenetic pathways and provide potentially new avenues for research and disease management in MB patients.    \u2020 Based on 21 nonhypermutable tumors analyzed in  (19) . \u2021 Based on 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors analyzed in  (16, 17) . \u00a7 Numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of total non-silent mutations.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese genes are large and have been reported in the COSMIC database to be altered in occasional cancers, but not at a sufficiently high frequency to distinguish them from passenger alterations (and with no evidence of a high fraction of inactivating mutations)  (30) . Interestingly, inactivating germline mutations of MLL2 have recently been identified as a cause of Kabuki syndrome, a multiple malformation disorder without known cancer predisposition  (31) . The general role of genes controlling histone methylation has become increasingly recognized as a common feature of human cancers. For example, inactivating mutations of the histone H3K27 demethylase gene UTX have been observed in multiple myelomas, esophageal cancers and renal cell cancers  (32) . In addition, a small fraction of renal cell cancers contain mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2 and the histone demethylase gene JARID1C  (33) , and the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 has been found to be mutated in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas  (34) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMost recently, frequent mutations of the chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A have been discovered in ovarian clear cell carcinomas  (20, 35) ; of note, one ARID1A mutation was discovered in our MB patients (table  S4 ). A link between histone methylation genes (although not MLL2 or MLL3) and MB has also previously been hypothesized based on the observation that copy number alterations affecting chromosomal regions containing histone methyltransferases or demethylases occur in a subset of MBs  (36) . The mechanism(s) through which MLL genes contribute to tumorigenesis are not known but some clues can be gleaned from the literature. The MLL family of histone H3K4 trimethylases includes seven genes (MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, MLL5, SET1A and SET1B)  (37) . MLL-family genes have been shown to regulate HOX gene expression  (38, 39) , and an attractive possibility is that they normally downregulate OTX2, an MB oncogene  (6, 7, 40) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.\nResults: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.\nAvailability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, although many NGS read preprocessing tools exist, none of them, alone or in combination, could offer the desired flexibility and performance, and most were not designed to work on paired-end data. As a result, we developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible, pair-aware and efficient preprocessing tool, optimized for Illumina NGS data.\n\nALGORITHMS\nTrimmomatic includes a variety of processing steps for read trimming and filtering, but the main algorithmic innovations are related to identification of adapter sequences and quality filtering, and are described in detail below. A list of the other processing steps is presented in the Supplementary Materials.\n\nRemoval of technical sequences\nTrimmomatic uses two approaches to detect technical sequences within the reads. The first, referred to as 'simple mode', works by finding an approximate match between the read and the usersupplied technical sequence. This mode has the advantage of working for all technical sequences, including adapters and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, or fragments thereof. Such sequences can be detected in any location or orientation within the reads but requires a substantial minimum overlap between the read and technical sequence to prevent false-positive findings.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe trimming status of each read can optionally be written to a log file. This is intended to help tune the choice of processing parameters used, but because it has a significant performance impact, it is not recommended unless needed.\n\nRESULTS\nTo illustrate the value of data preprocessing, we evaluated two different scenarios: reference-based alignment using Bowtie 2  (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012)  and BWA  (Li and Durbin, 2009)  against the Escherichia coli K-12/MG1655 reference (NCBI sequence NC_000913.2), and de novo assembly using Velvet  (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) , on public E.coli K-12/ MG1655 datasets (SRA datasets SRX131047 and SRR519926), as described in the Supplementary Methods.\n\nReference-based alignment\nDataset 1 (SRX131047) represents a typical Illumina library, sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 using 2 \u00c2 100 bp reads. Quality checking with FastQC revealed a notable quality drop in many reads after cycle 75 in both but did not report a high level of adapter contamination.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn the reference-based scenario, preprocessing increased the number of uniquely aligned reads from dataset 1, as seen in the first portion of Table  1 . Filtering for both adapters and quality achieves the best result, and quality trimming is especially important when alignment settings are strict. The Maximum Information approach outperforms the Sliding Window approach in both cases, with a wider margin when the alignment mode is strict. Notably, the optimal results for strict alignment and tolerant alignment were found using widely different quality stringency settings. (See Supplementary Results for more details.) To validate these results with an alternative aligner, we repeated the experiment using BWA. Although the alignment counts differ, because of slight differences between the tools in the settings or algorithms, the overall trend is similar. The best results are again achieved when filtering for both adapters and quality, as shown in the second part of Table  1 . Dataset 2 (SRR519926) is a 2 \u00c2 250 bp run, sequenced on an MiSeq. Although read quality is high at the start of each forward read, the longer read length allows more opportunity for errors Fig.  3 .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In a user-friendly format with one single function call, our package downloads and fully processes the desired TCGA data to be seamlessly integrated into a computational analysis pipeline. No further technical or biological knowledge is needed to utilize our software, thus making TCGA data easily accessible to data scientists without specific domain knowledge.\nAvailability and implementation: TCGA2STAT is available from the https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TCGA2STAT/index.html \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOthers have provided software to obtain the TCGA data. cBio, for example, provides an R and Matlab package but was not designed to be used for genome-scale data analysis. It requires input of a list of genes from users and thus limits the exploratory use of the data. Another R package, RTCGAToolbox downloads TCGA data from Firehose  (Samur, 2014) , but the downloaded data is not preprocessed into data formats conducive for multivariate statistical analysis. Further, linking and merging functions necessary for integrated statistical analyses such as sample matching across multiple platforms and merging clinical and molecular data are not available in this package. Because of these problems, use of the TCGA data can be limited to those with domain expertise, rendering the data inaccessible for general data scientists. In response, we have developed an R package TCGA2STAT that makes the TCGA data in the open access data tier easily accessible to all by downloading, wrangling and pre-processing the data into a data matrix or list of matrices ready for multivariate or integrated statistical analyses.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe package imports both molecular profiles and clinical data of more than thirty cancer types profiled with more than eleven high-throughput genomics platforms, including microarray, sequencing, methylation array, SNP array and array-CGH (See a full list in vignette). The imported molecular profiles and clinical data are automatically combined into a matrix for easy supervised analysis. Further, we provide functions for linking and merging samples from different molecular platforms that are necessary for integrated analysis. Most importantly, our package has one simple interface to perform all of these functions. The ease of obtaining this big biological data will encourage computational scientist to mine the TCGA data which in turn will bring new insights and breakthroughs in cancer research.\n\nImplementation\nThe TCGA2STAT package is developed under the R statistical computing environment and is compatible with version 3.0 or later. The package uses HTTP calls to the Firehose site and parses necessary information to download the data. This is achieved via functions implemented through the XML package  (Lang, 2013) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDetails of all wrangling and preprocessing steps are described in the package vignette (Supplementary Data).\n\nFunctions and examples\nThe TCGA2STAT package includes one major function and three additional utility functions: \u2022 getTCGA. This is the main function of the package which obtains data from Firehose and processes the data into a matrix that can be used directly for statistical analysis in R. Only two inputs are required: the cancer type desired and the data platform or molecular profiling type desired. Our package supports over thirty different cancer types and eleven different data platforms. For example, getTCGA(disease\u00bc\"OV\", data.type\u00bc \"RNASeq2\") will obtain the RNASeq2 level III RSEM data from TCGA ovarian cancer patients. With the same function, the user can specify the specific types of data for each platform, such as counts instead of RPKM for RNASeq data. Also, users can choose to download the molecular profiles along with clinical data or filter the data by particular clinical covariates. \u2022 SampleSplit. This function can be used to split the data imported via getTCGA into groups of samples profiled from the primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or normal/control groups.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Neural electrodes that are close-packed, such as in tetrodes, enable spatial oversampling of neural activity, which facilitates data analysis. Here we present the design and implementation of close-packed silicon microelectrodes, to enable spatially oversampled recording of neural activity in a scalable fashion.\nMethods\nOur probes are fabricated in a hybrid lithography process, resulting in a dense array of recording sites connected to submicron dimension wiring.\nResults\nWe demonstrate an implementation of a probe comprising 1000 electrode pads, each 9 \u00d7 9 \u03bcm, at a pitch of 11 \u03bcm. We introduce design automation and packaging methods that allow us to readily create a large variety of different designs.\nSignificance\nFinally, we perform neural recordings with such probes in the live mammalian brain that illustrate the spatial oversampling potential of closely packed electrode sites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn vivo experiments were done in accordance with MIT Committee on Animal Care approved protocols. An example of data collected with a single-shank probe bearing 64 pads is shown in Fig.  12 . The data illustrate the ability of close-packed recording sites to spatially oversample neural activity, and it shows how activity from the same neuron is picked up by several neighboring sites in its vicinity. The devices we fabricated have a standard recording site of 9 \u00d7 9 \u03bcm. We wanted to understand how the dimensions of a recording site impact its electrical properties. For this, we characterized the electrode impedance and the electrical noise as a function of recording site size. The data were collected from single-shank 64-channel probes with electrode site dimensions ranging from 2.4 to 9.6 \u03bcm. We gold electroplated each recording site with a constant current density protocol (60 pulses of 1 s at 0.1975 nA/\u03bcm 2 ). Fig.  13  shows the magnitude of the recording site impedance, measured at 1 kHz in 0.9% saline. As the electrode dimensions increase, the impedance decreases.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nfrom a dense array \n[12] -  [15] . In this paper, we demonstrate a close-packed silicon microelectrode technology that enables a tight continuum of recording sites along the length of the shank (Fig.  1 ), rather than discrete arrangements of tetrode-style pads or widely spaced sites. This arrangement, thus, enables tetrodelike spatial oversampling continuously running down the shank, so that sorting of spikes recorded by such densely packed electrodes can be facilitated for all the sites of the probe simultaneously. We use advanced lithography tools to create these close-packed arrangements in a scalable fashion, demonstrating probes with 1000 electrode pads situated on five shanks with 200 recording sites per shank. A key challenge with the traditional silicon electrode designs has been that wiring to the recording sites occupied a large fraction of the available shank width. This is problematic because scaling up the number of recording sites forces the shank geometry to widen, placing an upper bound on the number of sites practical for a single shank of a given width.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor example, the data suggests that even a 3 \u03bcm \u00d7 3 \u03bcm site has electrical characteristics com- patible with recording single unit activity, with impedances of 2 M\u03a9 and a noise level of 8 \u03bcV rms .\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe have introduced a platform to fabricate close-packed microelectrodes for neural recordings, and described the design, fabrication, and packaging methods that allow us to create a large range of scalable probe designs with close-packed recording sites. Although multisite silicon probes have been generated before, as noted in the introduction, the hybrid fabrication method here enables us uniquely to pursue electrode spacings far denser than in earlier implantable probes, thus enabling the feature of spatial oversampling of the neurons. The in vivo experiment and quantitative electrode site impedance and noise characterization demonstrated that by closely packing recording sites, we are able to spatially oversample and pick up unit activity on several recording sites at a time, and that the size of the recording sites can be reduced even lower than 9 \u03bcm. Our results suggest that close-packed electrodes may become not only instrumental for neuroscience, but also for understanding the basic principles of electrode design when scaling to large channel counts is required.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Structural studies have shed light on this and other chromatin modifying machines, but much less is known about how they assemble and whether stable and functional sub-modules exist that retain enzymatic activity. Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular the chromatin remodeler CHD4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via preformed and active sub-modules. These retain enzymatic activity and are present in both the nucleus and the cytosol, an outcome with important implications for understanding NuRD function. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n(d) MALDI-TOF analysis after an overnight deacetylation reaction of tetra-acetylated histone H4 (1-21) peptide by the dNuRD complex. Substrate peptides lacking up to four acetyl groups (complete deacetylation) are detected. We sought evidence for the hypothesis that a Simjang/MBD-like (or GATA2Da/b-MBD2/3) interaction is important for the association of the core PMMR deacetylase and CS chromatin-remodeling sub-modules, by carrying out single molecule tracking studies of CHD4 in the presence and absence of MBD3 in mESCs. The slowly moving molecules are not affected by the presence or absence of MBD3, and given the higher concentrations of CHD4 in the cell, and its known NuRD-independent functions, we suspect that they may correspond to CHD4 that is not associated with NuRD  [38] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n5 . Interaction of CHD4 with the core PMMR complex. (a) 2D single-molecule tracking of single mEos3-tagged CHD4 molecules in live mESCs show differences in the diffusion of a sub-population of CHD4 molecules in the presence (WT) and absence of MBD3 (MBD3-null). Representative images of the same cell are shown (top right) using low power 488-nm excitation (green form of mEos3) and 405-nm/561-nm excitation (photo-activated red form of mEos3). A small number of the individual tracks from this cell are also shown indicating the fast and slow diffusing fractions of CHD4. The exact diffusion coefficients extracted from the data are shown in a box-and-whisker plot (lower right). A total of 23,854 and 20,039 tracks were analyzed for the wild-type and MBD3-null cells, respectively. (b) A putative model of NuRD complex assembly is shown in a schematic representation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn mammalian cells, the NuRD complex is known to comprise helicase-containing nucleosome remodeling ATPases (CHD3/4/5), histone deacetylases (HDAC1/ 2), histone chaperones (RbAp46/48), methyl-cytosine DNA-binding domain proteins (MBD2/3), metastasis tumor antigens (MTA1/2/3), and the GATA-type zinc finger proteins (GATAD2a/b) (for recent reviews, see refs.

Note -we use CHD4 instead of Mi-2 throughout this paper.] It is therefore clear that considerable component variability exists within the mammalian NuRD complex suggesting that different versions of the complex might have distinct activities and biological functions in different cell types  [14] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n5 ). In turn, Z-scores obtained through the FF null model were only slightly sensitive or even invariant to matrix fill, size and shape (Fig.  6 ). NODF correctly identified randomness for 93% and 99.5% of the non-nested matrices through the EE and the FF null models, respectively.  \n\nEmpirical matrices\nThe degrees of nestedness produced by the four metrics were moderately to strongly positively correlated (Fig.  7 ). NODF showed strong correlations with Nd1 and NC and a moderate correlation with NT (Fig.  7 ). Conversely, NT had the lowest bivariate correlations and higher point dispersions in their scatterplots. However, the distributions of their values were clearly distinct (Fig.  7 ) According to our new metric, most empirical matrices have degrees of nestedness between 40 and 70 (Fig.  7 ). Degrees of nestedness according to NODF were lower than those calculated using NT (Z 0(8.37, p B0.001) and Nd1 (Z 0(8.83, pB0.001).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNT also produced higher degrees of nestedness when compared to Nd1 (Z 0(2.06, pB0.039). Respectively, 92.3% and 99.6% of the empirical matrices examined by NT and Nd1 had higher degrees of nestedness than NODF. These differences were similar when degrees of nestedness obtained by NT and Nd1 were compared to NODF only among sites and only among species occupancy (p B0.001 for the four comparisons). NODF identified 237 of the 287 empirical matrices as being significantly nested under the EE null model. On the other hand, under the FF null model NODF identified only three empirical matrices as being nested. NODF also indicated that nestedness in species occupancy (mean 054.0) is significantly lower than nestedness in species composition among sites (mean 060.6; Z 0(9.25, pB0.001).\n\nDiscussion\nWhy another metric?\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFinally, it is important to highlight that NODF was thought to be dependent on the arrangement of columns and rows to allow testing hypotheses on the causes of nestedness by ordering columns and rows according to any reasoned criteria instead of only by the marginal totals.\n\nConsistency with the concept of nestedness\nWe evaluated the consistency of T, C, d1 and NODF with the usual concept of nestedness using model matrices.

However, single-cell differences have been largely neglected in the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation. Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function--such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells--are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1b, c ). A number of parameters can be deduced from these data and the correlation of these to genetic variants tested. Considering gene expression phenotypes in terms of single-cell distributions provides important information about gene regulation, as the noise from the regulation of transcription can be considered separately from the noise of RNA turnover (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Thus constitutively expressed genes, for example, are expected to be less noisy, demonstrating mostly the thermodynamic noise of RNA turnover in the absence of variable regulation (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Analyzing four, public, single-cell RNA sequencing data sets  6, 7  , we found that this is indeed the case (Supplementary Notes, section 1). A gene that is not constitutively expressed can be described in terms of how often it switches 'on' (burst frequency), the amount of RNA produced when 'on' (burst size) and the rate at which its RNA is degraded. A recent study 11 of 8,000 human loci found that almost all of them exhibited such 'bursty' expression, with certain loci modulating burst frequency and others modulating burst size.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese models and their rationales are further detailed in the Online Methods and Supplementary Notes, section 2. Gene expression distributions can also be described in terms of heterogeneous cell subpopulations. We considered cells in different stages of the cell cycle, and their varying proportions between samples. Using flow cytometry, we excluded cells with increased DNA content, as would be expected in the S and G 2 cell cycle phases. We further subdivided cells into G 1 and early S-phase based on their expression of GTSE1, a cell division molecular switch that becomes highly expressed in the S and G 2 phases  14  . Almost two-thirds of the genes demonstrated altered expression between G 1 and early S-phase (PPP2R1A is shown in Fig.  1b ), raising the question of how many associations are driven by differences in cell cycle subpopulation proportions between samples. Per cell culture, the proportion of cells without increased DNA content was found to be significantly anti-correlated with cell density after 48 h of growth (Spearman's \u03c1, -log 10 P = 5.00).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nGene expression typically had much greater variability between cells within an individual than between individuals, and the distribution of gene expression values is very different between individuals for some genes. (Fig.  1a ). The currently understood reasons for this large cell-to-cell noise are thermodynamic, regulatory and cellular (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). As a basis for studying the association of single-cell phenotypes with genetic variants, we first sought to generate high-quality data in a large population of cells (1,440 cells). We measured gene expression using highly parallel qPCR validated with digital PCR, as single-cell RNA sequencing still faces notable technical challenges  6, 7  . We focused on 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling, a major regulator of the cell cycle that has been highlighted as a key pathway in clinical GWAS and cancer epidemiology (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Of the 92 genes studied, 46 are listed in the Catalog of Genome-Wide Association Studies ( http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The ignimbrite is crystal rich (20\u201330%), of rhyodacite to low-silica rhyolite composition and lacks any consistent compositional zonation. Pumice whole-rock and glass compositions and crystal rim chemistries imply that the final erupted magma body was, to a first order, homogeneous, with the only variations reflecting crystal:glass proportions in analysed clasts. Crystals from pumices can be divided into two populations based on textural and chemical signatures: those that are inferred to have grown within the final erupted magma body (82% of plagioclase, 88% of orthopyroxene, 17% of amphibole), and those that originated in a chemically heterogeneous mush zone (18% of plagioclase, 12% of orthopyroxene, 83% of amphibole). Crystal-rich microcrystalline clasts, and clots within pumices, provide direct samples of parts of this heterogeneous source region. Amphibole model temperatures and pressures, coupled with in-situ trace element concentrations suggest that the mush region extended to ~ 15 km depth, near the base of the quartzofeldspathic crust and was rich in amphibole. Amphibole plus subordinate plagioclase and orthopyroxene, as well as antecrystic zircon were extracted from the crystal mush and ascended to a final storage region. Model temperatures and pressures from amphibole rims and Fe\u2013Ti oxide model temperatures imply that the final erupted magma body was stored between 770 and 840 \u00b0C at 4\u20136 km depths. Homogenisation of the magma body occurred through convective stirring accompanying gradually rising temperatures induced by less-evolved magma(s) emplaced at deeper levels. Plagioclase records a steady core-to-rim increase in An content, implying that a gradual heating and/or increase in H2O in the final erupted magma body occurred over some significant period prior to the eruption. No signals of a rapid defrosting or rejuvenation event that could be considered as an eruption trigger are recorded by the crystal phases. The Ongatiti ignimbrite has features both common to, and distinct from crystal rich \u2018monotonous intermediates\u2019 and crystal-poor compositionally zoned rhyolites. As such, the Ongatiti ignimbrite demonstrates that \u2018monotonous rhyolites\u2019 can also be developed on a large scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition to evidence of temperature and pressure controlled cation exchange in amphibole (Fig.  S6 ), three factors suggest that the model figures may be valid to a first order. First, at all stages the amphiboles appear to have cocrystallised with plagioclase, so ensuring that Al contents in the melt were buffered. Second, the use of other Al-in-amphibole barometers also yield pressures broadly consistent with those from the formulation of  Ridolfi et al. (2010) . Third, the Ongatiti ignimbrite contains scarce lithic fragments of basement schist  (Krippner et al., 1998) , in addition to the low-grade greywacke metasediment (which is ubiquitous in New Zealand ignimbrites), suggesting that deeper crustal levels (N ~10 km) were being excavated (cf.  Mortimer, 2000) . The extraction of crystals from an amphibole bearing mush at mid-crustal depths has also been suggested in the case of the Matahina eruption  (Deering, 2009; Deering et al., 2011) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n11b  and S5 ). These conditions correspond to model depths of amphibole core crystallisation between ~4 to 15 km and final pre-eruptive depths (crystallisation of rims) at shallower crustal levels between ~4 to 6 km (Fig.  11b ). The range in modelled pre-eruptive conditions, and the contrast in modelled pressures and temperatures between rims and cores correspond well with independently determined in-situ trace element concentrations. The lower depth of pre-eruptive conditions (~6 km) is marked by a significant change in amphibole chemistry at Al T values of ~0.4 and Eu/Eu* of ~0.3 (dashed line in Fig.  8 ). The maximum estimated depth of ~15 km is consistent with the estimated depth (~16 km) of the base of the quartzo-feldspathic crust beneath much of the central TVZ (e.g.,  Harrison and White, 2006) . The exact depth of the crust beneath Mangakino (to the north west of modelled seismic arrays) is, however, not well constrained.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe validity of model amphibole temperatures and pressures was assessed using cation abundances calculated following the method of  Leake et al. (2004) . Evidence for both temperature (edenite and Ti-Tschermak) and pressure (Al-tschermak) sensitive atomic substitution mechanisms are found across the whole amphibole dataset (cf.  Bachmann and Dungan, 2002; De Angelis et al., 2013)  (Fig.  S6 ). Amphibole rims show little or no correlations between cation abundances due to the consistency of amphibole rim concentrations (i.e. no significant variations in model temperature and pressure estimates). Average pre-eruptive temperature estimates from amphibole rims are within uncertainty of the model temperatures estimated from Fe-Ti oxides (Fig.  11 ). Higher temperature (870-970 \u00b0C) crystals with dark and/or patchy cores yield higher estimations of melt H 2 O (~6 wt.%) compared to ~5 wt.% in lower temperature cores and rims.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The exact reaction process by which they originate is still debated and their hybrid nature is controversial. We show that textural and chemical inheritances of the pre-existing mantle are preserved in olivine-rich troctolites recently sampled at the Central Indian Ridge. The occurrence of a large orthopyroxene of a probable mantle origin suggests that these rocks formed through the reactive overprint of a mantle peridotite. Combining our data with those of olivine-rich troctolites worldwide, we show that the clinopyroxenes from these rocks follow chemical trends slightly distinct to those of the oceanic gabbros. These chemical trends can be ascribed to crystallization from melts assimilating mantle peridotites, suggesting that a \u201cmantle flavor\u201d can be locally retained in these hybrid rocks. The present distribution of Ol-rich troctolites suggests that melt-mantle reaction processes by which these rocks originate is likely to be more diffuse at slower spreading environments, where extensive melt-rock reactions within a thick thermal boundary layer enhances the conversion of the shallow oceanic mantle into hybrid crustal rocks. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n3 ). These chemical variations have been previously related to the crystallization from melts enriched in incompatible elements due to melt-mass reduction  (Drouin et al., 2009)  and synchronous crystallization of late stage phases (i.e., amphibole;  Borghini and Rampone, 2007)  at the closure of the magmatic system. However, a similar process cannot explain the sharp increase in the Zr N /Nd N ratio at increasing Yb concentrations (Fig.  4c ), nor the high and constant Cr contents of the Ol-rich troctolite Cpx. Systematic studies showed that fractionation of Zr from Nd (more to less incompatible elements) also typically characterize the Cpx rims from many gabbro suites (Fig.  4c ). This chemical feature has been generally attributed to the effect of reactive melt migration in a crystal mush (e.g.,  Coogan et al., 2000; Gao et al., 2007; Coogan 2007) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n;  Coogan et al., 2000; Drouin et al., 2009; Lissenberg and Dick, 2008; Renna and Tribuzio, 2011; Suhr et al., 2008) , but likely derived from melts constantly buffered by (or mixed with) melts residual from interactions with a Cr-rich ultramafic matrix  (Arai et al., 1997; Dick and Natland, 1996) . This hypothesis is supported by experimental studies (e.g.  Saper and Liang, 2014) , which showed that the magmatic Cpx with Cr contents up to 12000 ppm and relatively high incompatible element compositions (i.e., TiO 2 ) may crystallize by melt interacting with mantle peridotites.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis is in agreement with the evidence that the extreme Zr/Nd fractionations are documented exclusively in the rim/interstitial/filmlike Cpx grains, which likely crystallized at the final stages of the interaction process  (Drouin et al., 2009) . Given the number of variables arbitrarily fixed in this calculation (e.g. compositions of the initial melt and of the assimilated phases), we cannot demonstrate that this AFC process is the only contributor to the incompatible element budget of the Cpx from the Ol-rich troctolites. However, our calculation supports the idea that the different Zr, Nd and Yb variations of the Cpx in Ol-rich troctolites and those in gabbros may be related to different melt-rock reaction scenarios, respectively in mantle and lower crustal environments. In agreement with the occurrence of a relict mantle Opx, the chemistry of the Cpx from Ol-rich troctolites worldwide suggest that these rocks most likely formed by melts buffered by the dissolution of a preexisting Opx-bearing mantle peridotite. The melt-rock reaction scenario we propose in this study confirms observations on highly reacted harzburgites (i.e.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Our calculations show a band structure close to the free-electron-like limit due to the high electronic kinetic energy induced by pressure. Bands are properly described even in the independent electron approximation fully neglecting the electron-electron interaction. Linear-response harmonic calculations show a dynamically stable phonon spectrum with marked Kohn anomalies. Even if the electron-electron interaction has a minor role in the electronic bands, the inclusion of electronic exchange and correlation in the density response is essential to obtain a dynamically stable structure. Anharmonic effects, which are calculated within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, harden high-energy optical modes and soften transverse acoustic modes up to a 20% in energy. Despite a large impact of anharmonicity has been predicted in several high-pressure hydrides, here the superconducting critical temperature is barely affected by anharmonicity, as it is lowered from its harmonic 318 K value only to 300 K at 500 GPa. We attribute the small impact of anharmonicity on superconductivity to the absence of softened optical modes and the fairly uniform distribution of the electron-phonon coupling among the vibrational modes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n34.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Electronic structure Hydrogen, containing a single proton and an electron, is supposed to leave its common molecular nature under a sufficient high pressure to form a metal similar to the alkalies. In the high pressure limit the dominant electronic kinetic energy would be responsible for ending up with a free-electron-like metal. However, in the analyzed pressure range we are still close to the dissociation/metalization pressure  23  and the problem is not as simple as one could imagine a priori. Fig.  2a  shows the electronic band structure of I4 1 /amd hydrogen at 500 GPa. The bands present a huge dispersion, associated to the dominating kinetic term in the energies of the electronic states. The calculated band structure is not far from the free-electron approximation, the main difference being the band gaps opened at the border of the BZ and whenever band crossing occurs due to the interaction of the electrons with the proton lattice.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNevertheless, the Lindhard RPA spectrum completely differs from the ab initio calculations. The intensity of the Kohn anomalies is much stronger and the transverse acoustic modes become unstable with imaginary frequencies. Therefore, even though the electronic band structure could be understood within the free-electron-like approximation, phonons seem to be far from this picture, contrary to the case of sodium  41, 46  . This fact also questions the stability of the I4 1 /amd tetragonal phase in the ultimate high-pressure limit where the electrons are expected to be free. If we split the dynamical matrix in the D p and D e terms, we note that each of them scales differently with the average inter-electronic distance parameter r s : D p always scales as r -3 s , while, in the Lindhard RPA, D e scales as r -2 s (r s + C), where C is always positive and of the order of unity. Therefore, in the very large pressure limit with small r s , the D p contribution is expected to dominate over the electronic contribution. In Fig.  4  we present the dispersion of the root of the eigenvalues of each contribution separately.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is interesting to point out that if we consider the independent electron approximation, just keeping the V e,p term that gives the electron-proton interaction in the V scf selfconsistent potential and neglecting the V H Hartree and V xc electron-electron interactions (see Appendix for details), the resulting bands match almost perfectly with the DFT ones. Therefore, we can conclude that main differences with the free-electron approximation are due to the large proton-electron interaction, and that the interaction between the electrons is not giving any significant contribution to the band structure. Fig.  2b  shows the Fermi surface, which is quite spherical. However, the sphere shows some open areas around the high symmetry point N, where it touches the BZ boundary and a band gap is opened.\n\nB. Vibrational properties\nIn Fig.  3  we show the calculated phonon dispersion in tetragonal I4 1 /amd hydrogen at 500 GPa within DFPT. We also show the phonons at 400 and 600 GPa, but due to the minor qualitative changes we will focus just in the 500 GPa spectrum, as the analysis should be valid for all the pressure range.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, typical examples are chemically unstable and lack intrasheet \u03c0-conjugation, thereby significantly limiting their applications. Here we report a chemically stable, electronically conjugated organic framework with topologically designed wire frameworks and open nanochannels, in which the \u03c0 conjugation-spans the two-dimensional sheets. Our framework permits inborn periodic ordering of conjugated chains in all three dimensions and exhibits a striking combination of properties: chemical stability, extended \u03c0-delocalization, ability to host guest molecules and hole mobility. We show that the \u03c0-conjugated organic framework is useful for high on-off ratio photoswitches and photovoltaic cells.

We selected C 3 -symmetric triphenylene hexamine (TPHA)  57  and C 2 -symmetric tertbutylpyrene tetraone (PT)  58  as building blocks for the topological ring fusion reaction and prepared the crystalline phenazine-linked CS-COF in isolated yields of 86-90% under solvothermal conditions. The tert-butyl side groups in PT were employed for enhancing the solubility of monomer.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy virtue of their three-dimensional orderings at the atomic scale, 2D COFs have shown a great potential to perform core functions in organic electronics such as light emission  9, 10  , charge transfer and separation  23, 27  , and semiconduction  9, 10, 17, [19] [20] [21] 23, 26, 28, 29  . However, typical COFs lack intrasheet p-conjugation and chemical stability, which significantly limit their practical utility. To address this shortcoming, a chemically stable yet fully pconjugated COF is highly desirable. Such a framework with threedimensionally ordered chain alignment may provide a solution for the long-standing daunting challenges in semiconducting polymer technology  [36] [37] [38]  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA two-step stereoselective preparation of a topologically chiral 6  2  1 link, in the shape of a Star of David, is presented. Six equivalent of metal-ion templates is employed to drive self-assembly with six chiral building blocks into a helicate scaffold; a suitable bridge is designed between two chelating sites to direct the size of this hexamer; the length and conformational freedom of extended aliphatic olefin chains are modeled to ensure successful metathesis toward the desired connectivity; and the chiral moiety adjacent to the coordination units is placed to secure topological chirality. Such tactics are practically important in molecular nanotopology and create opportunities not only to explore the effects of chemical constitution on topological and tangled materials but also to elucidate the consequences of topological chirality in chemistry and beyond.

The early example by von Zelewsky and co-workers presented a highly stereoselective self-assembly of a hexameric circular helicate by using pinene-bipyridine ligand (Figure  1B ). Both hexamer and tetramer were detected in solution using silver(I) template,  52, 53  whereas only hexamer was formed with copper(I) metal ions.  54  We envisage that this helicate provides an orderly hexagonal entanglement arrangement required for the formation of a Star of David catenane, the suitable alteration of this CHIRAGEN ligand would deliver the construction of the only L-enantiomer of a 6  2  1 link.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process: we call this approach reticular synthesis. This chemistry has yielded materials designed to have predetermined structures, compositions and properties. In particular, highly porous frameworks held together by strong metal-oxygen-carbon bonds and with exceptionally large surface area and capacity for gas storage have been prepared and their pore metrics systematically varied and functionalized. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus, it might be considered a subclass of crystal engineering. Research in the area of MOFs and, to a lesser extent, inorganic frameworks, has recently progressed far enough to provide examples which show the feasibility of the building-block approach and the scope of reticular synthesis. Here we take selected examples to highlight the ideas involved, with emphasis on our own work on MOFs in which structural and thermal stability characterization have been combined with in-depth studies of surface area and gas sorption capacities. The subject of metal-organic frameworks has a long history, however, so we begin by giving some perspectives on the field.\n\nPerspectives and challenges\nThe Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) documents the crystal structures of more than 11,000 extended metal-organic compounds in which a metal ion or cluster has been linked by an organic moiety in which the linking functionality is a cyanide, pyridyl, phosphate or carboxylate. Of these, nearly 3,000 compounds have threedimensional (3D) structures and about double that number have 2D structures.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA lthough the synthesis of new materials has long been recognized as the most essential element in advancing technology, it generally remains more of an art than a science-in that the discovery of new compounds has mostly been serendipitous, using methods referred to by critics as 'shake and bake', 'mix and wait' and 'heat and beat'. For much of the twentieth century, this worked well for the synthesis of important solid-state materials, and we expect that it will continue to yield interesting compounds. However, it is becoming increasingly urgent to produce materials designed to perform highly specific and cooperative functions \n1, 2  . Recent extensive research into the design and synthesis of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) has led to numerous practical and conceptual developments in that direction  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  . Specifically, the chemistry of MOFs has provided an extensive class of crystalline materials with high stability, tunable metrics, organic functionality, and porosity. Here we present some of the important developments that have shaped this rapidly growing field and propose a general conceptual framework, which serves as a useful tool in designing materials constructed from molecular building blocks.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTetrahedral building blocks such as HMT  32     33  have been linked by metal ions to form decorated diamond structures, while TPY  34  and ATC  35  are examples of links predesigned so that their assembly into diamond networks is done by linking through hydrogen bonding. Consideration of this range of crystal structures, in particular those of MOFs, has led us to identify two critical questions for reticular synthesis. First, of the almost unlimited possible networks, which can be expected to form and how can they be synthesized?\n\nBox 1\n\n\nDefinitions and structures\nHere we define some terms and illustrate organic species referred to in the text by abbreviations in the Box 1 figure.

We identified a mechanism of intrinsic multi-drug resistance based on the survival of a tumor cell subpopulation. Treatment with various drugs, including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (OXPHOS) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a two-tiered approach combining anti-cancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis concept is gaining prominence in the field of cancer research, with several studies reporting the enrichment of quiescent cancer stem cells after chemotherapy. For example, slow-cycling glioblastoma cells survive temozolomide treatment  (Chen et al., 2012) . Accordingly, if cell subpopulations can act as major drivers for tumor maintenance and mediate universal therapeutic resistance, approaches that target this phenotype could increase the efficacy of treatment regimens and reduce the risk of melanoma relapses. We have recently demonstrated that, even within highly proliferative melanomas, there is a slow-cycling cell subpopulation that is identifiable by the expression of the histone 3 K4 demethylase JARID1B  (Roesch et al., 2005 (Roesch et al., , 2010)) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nJARID1B (KDM5B/ PLU-1/RBP2-H1) is a member of the highly conserved family of jumonji/ARID1 H3K4 demethylases, which are involved in tissue development, cancer, and stem cell biology  (Christensen et al., 2007; Dey et al., 2008; Yamane et al., 2007) . The JARID1B high slow-cycling subpopulation is required for the continuous tumor growth of melanoma; however, it does not follow a unidirectional cancer stem cell hierarchy. The JARID1B high phenotype is temporarily distinct, dynamic, and can be acquired depending on the microenvironmental context  (Roesch et al., 2010) . In this respect, another study indicates that other types of cancers, such as breast or lung cancer, also harbor populations of quiescent cells that are drug resistant and whose phenotypes can switch dynamically  (Sharma et al., 2010) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nInterestingly, in the latter study, slow-cycling cells were characterized by the expression of the chromatin-remodeling factor JARID1A, a homolog of JARID1B. Considering JARID1B's role in continuous tumor maintenance  (Roesch et al., 2010) , we asked (1) whether the subpopulation of JARID1B high slow-cycling melanoma cells displays lower drug susceptibility compared to the bulk of tumor cells and (2) whether this resistant phenotype can be pharmacologically eradicated.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nCytotoxic Treatment of Melanoma Cells Results in the Enrichment of a Surviving JARID1B high Slow-Cycling Subpopulation\nTo assess whether slow-cycling melanoma cells show differences in the therapeutic response compared to the rapidly prolif-erating bulk, we treated melanoma cultures with various anticancer drugs. To discriminate between slowly and rapidly cycling subpopulations, we used a JARID1B-promoter-EGFPreporter construct, as previously described  (Roesch et al., 2010) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics, and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial genetic evidence supporting the concept that lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for LDTFs and informative histone modifications can be used for prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n10c ).\n\nDiscussion\nIn concert, we have exploited natural genetic variation to test a collaborative model for enhancer selection and function, and conversely explored the ability of this model to explain strain-specific differences in transcription factor binding and epigenetic features associated with functional enhancers in macrophages. These studies provide genetic evidence that lineage-determining transcription factors are dependent on collaborative binding to variably spaced DNA recognition motifs in order to select enhancers and enable binding of signaldependent transcription factors. Notably, the variable motif distances observed at co-bound LDTF loci suggests that collaborative binding does not generally require direct proteinprotein interactions between the involved transcription factors. The proposed hierarchical LDTF collaborative model provides a conceptual framework for prioritization of non-coding disease-associated regulatory variants. While all cells express hundreds of transcription factors, a large fraction of functional enhancers (~70% in macrophages) are characterized by collaborative interactions involving relatively small sets of lineage determining transcription factors (e.g., PU.1, AP-1 and C/EBPs). The requirement for collaborative binding interactions provides an explanation for why transcription factor binding is lost at sites where mutations do not occur in the cognate recognition motif.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe binding of these factors is proposed to 'prime' DNA by initiating deposition of histone modifications that are associated with cis-active regulatory regions (Fig.  1a , ii -> iii) and enable concurrent or subsequent binding of signal-dependent transcription factors that direct regulated gene expression (Fig.  1a , iii ->iv)  6, 13, 15, 16  . In principle, this model provides a straightforward framework that allows non-coding variants to be classified with respect to their ability to directly perturb LDTF binding and their potential to exert indirect effects on binding of other LDTFs and signal-dependent transcription factors. To test the validity of this model and its ability to explain effects of genetic variation on transcription factor binding and function, we exploited the naturally-occurring genetic variation between the inbred C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mouse strains (~4 million SNPs and ~750k InDels  17  ) as an 'in vivo mutagenesis screen.'\n\nDirect effects of genetic variation\nFirst, we quantified genome-wide binding patterns of macrophage LDTFs PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b1 from both mouse strains using ChIP-Seq.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn the case of NF-\u03baB, for example, mutations in the motifs for lineage determining factors were approximately three times more likely to result in decreased binding of NF-\u03baB than mutations in the NF-\u03baB binding site itself. An essential step in leveraging the collaborative model to pinpoint potential disease-causing variants is the definition of relevant LDTF binding sites and functionally important variants. At the current level of genome annotation, this cannot be achieved by analysis of DNA sequence alone. For example, there are ~1-2\u00d710 6 identifiable PU.1 binding sites in the human  29  and mouse genomes, but <10% are actually occupied by PU.1 in macrophages. By experimentally defining strain-similar and strain-specific binding patterns for PU.1, the relevant sites at which mutations can result in altered function are identified. Comparison of PU.1 motif mutations associated with strain-specific versus strainsimilar binding allowed the genetic definition of a functional binding matrix and additional distinguishing features that enabled accurate prediction of functional mutations in a third strain.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

But their ultra-short lifetime, typically 100 fs or less, and correspondingly short transport length-scale in the nanometre range constrain real-space investigations. Here we report variable temperature and voltage measurements of the nonlocal manipulation of adsorbed molecules on the Si(111)-7 \u00d7 7 surface in the scanning tunnelling microscope. The range of the nonlocal effect increases with temperature and, at constant temperature, is invariant over a wide range of electron energies. The measurements probe, in real space, the underlying hot electron dynamics on the 10 nm scale and are well described by a two-dimensional diffusive model with a single decay channel, consistent with 2-photon photo-emission (2PPE) measurements of the real time dynamics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nT he dynamics of hot electrons, those with energies perhaps hundreds of times greater than the available thermal energy, is central to understanding the properties of many electronic devices. For example, they contribute to leakage currents across CMOS transistors and may fundamentally limit their downsizing \n[1] [2] [3]  and they are intrinsic to solar cells, where high energy photons generate hot electrons that consequently generate a photocurrent  [4] [5] [6]  . Hot electrons can also, for example, be induced through plasmonics  [7] [8] [9]  and offer a route to instigate non-thermal chemical reactions  10  . Hot electron charge transport is thus the subject of major scientific research, both experimentally and theoretically  [11] [12] [13] [14]  . But the experiments are constrained by the ultra-short lifetime of hot electrons, typically 100 fs or less, and hence their corresponding transport length-scale of a few nm (refs 15,16). Direct pump-probe measurements with ultra-fast lasers typically provide little or no spatial information.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n49) and for that found for carrier diffusion in single silicon core-shell nanowires of 35 cm 2 s \u00c0 1 (ref. 50). Figure  3b  presents the temperature dependence of the nonlocal length-scale l. As the lattice temperature increases so does the nonlocal manipulation range. This further conforms to the diffusive transport model which, unlike ballistic transport, should increase with increasing temperature. The relationship also demonstrates the connection between the temperature of the crystal lattice and the measured electron dynamics. Hot electrons undergo several scattering processes to bring them into eventual thermal equilibrium with a crystal lattice. Typically carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering brings a population of hot carriers into a Fermi-Dirac distribution with some characteristic hot electron temperature T e within 10 s of fs (refs 43,51,52). We inject at currents of B100 pA and therefore have, on average, one-electron injected every 1 ns. Given the 180 fs lifetime of the electrons within the 2.0 eV state, we rule out carrier-carrier scattering. Further carrier-phonon scattering brings the mean energy of the electron distribution down to ultimately thermalize with the lattice.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn our case, this carrierphonon scattering appears to occur within the high-lying 2.0 eV state since we have a temperature dependence of the nonlocal range. Subsequent scattering, here in a time of 180 fs, removes the electron from this state to lower lying states. There is therefore a competition between electron-phonon scattering thermalizing the hot-electron within the 2.0 eV state and scattering that electron into a lower lying state. This will result in a dynamic quasi-equilibrated electron distribution within the 2.0 eV state. To gain an insight into this connection we present a simple model of the temperature dependence of the nonlocal effect in terms of a 2D random walk. The RMS of a 2D random walk can be equated to 2D diffusion by l ffiffiffiffi N p \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2Dt p ; where l is the random walk step length and N the number of steps. Hence our length-scale l \u00bc l ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi N=2 p .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

They are predicted to exist in a vortex core of superconducting topological insulators. However, it is extremely difficult to distinguish them experimentally from other quasiparticle states for the tiny energy difference between Majorana fermions and these states, which is beyond the energy resolution of most available techniques. Here, we circumvent the problem by systematically investigating the spatial profile of the Majorana mode and the bound quasiparticle states within a vortex in Bi(2)Te(3) films grown on a superconductor NbSe(2). While the zero bias peak in local conductance splits right off the vortex center in conventional superconductors, it splits off at a finite distance \u223c20 nm away from the vortex center in Bi(2)Te(3). This unusual splitting behavior has never been observed before and could be possibly due to the Majorana fermion zero mode. While the Majorana mode is destroyed by the interaction between vortices, the zero bias peak splits as a conventional superconductor again. This work provides self-consistent evidences of Majorana fermions and also suggests a possible route to manipulating them. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis leads to an unusual p-wave-like paired state that is time-reversal invariant and robust against disorder  8  . Theoretical studies later showed that the MFs may also reside at two ends of a semiconductor nanowire (NW) with strong spin-orbit coupling when it is contacted to an s-wave SC in a proper external magnetic field  9  . Several transport measurements revealed a signature of MFs, i.e., a sharp zero-bias peak in differential conductance spectrum, in various NW/SC junctions  [10] [11] [12] [13]  . In InSb/Nb junction, an unconventional fractional a.c. Josephson effect was observed and attributed to the existence of MFs 14 . However, alternative explanations of these transport results based on disorder and/or band bending in the NWs have been proposed  [15] [16] [17] [18]  . As yet, no conclusive evidence has been established for the existence of MF. In contrary, the disorder alone is unlikely to induce a zero-bias peak in a TI/SC heterostructure, which can be used to detect MFs without complications mentioned above.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nStrong evidences undoubtedly show that the Majorana mode existing in the vortex of the Bi 2 Te 3 /NbSe 2 hetero-structure. Since the TSS is protected by the time reversal symmetry, the Majorana mode in our configuration is free from impurities and defects. In fact, the defects may suppress the normal bound states in the vortex, and enhance the Majorana mode. It is also found the Majorana mode can be tuned off by increasing magnetic field. This might provide a route to controlling MF for quantum computation. In the future, it is highly interesting but challenging to pursue the quantum limit with the Fermi level near the Dirac point and T < DE (where T is the temperature and DE is the energy level spacing of the bound states), in which the zero mode Majorana fermion may be directly observed.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFigure  1C  shows a typical contour of zero-bias differential conductance (ZBC) taken on a 1QL Bi 2 Te 3 film in an external magnetic field of 0.1T. An Abrikosov vortex is clearly seen, which exhibits higher ZBC values due to the suppression of superconductivity within the vortex. At the center of the vortex, a peak in dI/dV due to the bound quasi-particle states can be measured as shown in Fig.  1D  (see supplementary materials for the experimental conditions). Along the dashed line indicated in Fig.  1C , we measured the spatial variation of the dI/dV spectra as a function of distance (r) away from the vortex center. The results are given in Fig.  2A . One can see that only one peak appears at zero-bias in the dI/dV spectra near the vortex center, and the peak splits into two at a finite distance r. The splitting energy increases linearly with r. For a better view, we plot dI/dV as functions of r and sample bias V in a fake color image in Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Key uncertainties in kilonova modeling include the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products\u2014non-thermal beta-particles, alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays\u2014and the efficiency with which their kinetic energy is absorbed by the ejecta. The radioactive energy emitted, along with its thermalization efficiency, sets the luminosity budget and is therefore crucial for predicting kilonova light curves. We outline uncertainties in the radioactivity, describe the processes by which the decay products transfer energy to the ejecta, and calculate time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We determine the net thermalization efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process yields\u2014in particular, the production of \n-decaying translead nuclei\u2014and on ejecta mass, velocity, and magnetic fields. We incorporate our results into detailed radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated kilonova light curve predictions. Thermalization effects reduce kilonova luminosities by a factor of roughly 2 at peak, and by an order of magnitude at later times (15 days or more after explosion). We present analytic fits to time-dependent thermalization efficiencies, which can be used to improve light curve models. We revisit the putative kilonova that accompanied gamma-ray burst 130603B, and estimate the mass ejected in that event. We find later time kilonova light curves can be significantly impacted by alpha-decay from translead isotopes; data at these times may therefore be diagnostic of ejecta abundances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAccounting for time-dependent thermalization efficiencies has a significant impact on kilonova luminosity, particularly for models with lower masses and higher velocities. For our fiducial model, the predicted luminosity is lower by a factor of \uf0882 at peak, and by 10 days is lower by an factor of 5. 18. Select broadband light curves for our fiducial ejecta model for two treatments of thermalization: full f t tot ( ) (left panel), and the cruder treatment employed in earlier kilonova calculations (right panel). The curves are dimmer in the newer models, reflecting the reduction in thermalized energy, but relationships between the light curves in the various bands is mostly unchanged, so the kilonova colors are preserved.

The reason for CO2 promotion is not sufficiently understood at the particle level due to the catalyst complexity and the high demands of characterization under true reaction conditions. Herein, we applied operando synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and modulated-excitation infrared spectroscopy on a commercial catalyst to gain insights into its morphology and surface chemistry. These studies unveiled that Cu and ZnO agglomerate and ZnO particles flatten under CO/H2 and/or CO2 /H2 . Under the optimal CO/CO2 /H2 mixture, sintering is prevented and ZnO crystals adopt an elongated shape due to the minimal presence of the H2 O byproduct, enhancing the water-gas shift activity and thus the methanol production. Our results provide a rationale to the CO2 promotion emphasizing the importance of advanced analytical methods to establish structure-performance relations in heterogeneous catalysis. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn conclusion, our study established correlations between the Cu and ZnO particle size and morphology,t he reaction mechanism, and the activity of acommercial Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst upon methanol synthesis under various gas compositions and industrial conditions.O perando SXRPD elucidated that Cu particles retained their cuboctahedral shape but sintered under CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 .T his phenomenon was associated with the segregation of Cu from ZnO upon CO hydrogenation and with the presence of H 2 Ou pon CO 2 hydrogenation. With respect to the hexagonal ZnO particles, aC O/H 2 atmosphere did not provoke significant alterations but growth and formation of platelet-like morphologies were observed under CO 2 /H 2 .S ince CO 2 hydrogenation was only slightly improved over smaller Cu particles and was insensitive to the morphology of ZnO,wededuced that this reaction cannot become al imiting step for the promotional effect.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn the CO/CO 2 /H 2 mixture with the optimal CO 2 concentration, the low amount of H 2 Of ormed prevented Cu and ZnO sintering.M oreover,t he ZnO prism-like crystallites preferentially elongated along their hexagonal axis.M E-DRIFTS during reaction evidenced astrong suppression of the RWGS in catalyst samples containing platelet-like ZnO particles.The higher amount of polar facets in these structures leads to enhanced electronic interactions with Cu, which inhibit the active sites on the latter. In contrast, the preferred elongation of ZnO under the optimal gas mixture augmented the fraction of non-polar facets exposed, boosting the WGS reaction and, thus,t he MeOH formation from CO 2 .T hese findings rationalize the promotional effect and indicate that the best catalyst structure for CO 2 -promoted MeOH synthesis comprises small Cu particles in contact with rod-like ZnO crystallites, preferably stabilized by structural promoters.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[4]  Thel atter is much faster than the hydrogenation of CO but strongly limited by thermodynamics and product inhibition by H 2 Oa th igh CO 2 concentrations resulting in the typical volcano plot shown in Figure  1 (described later).

Guo et al. further underlined this potential. They claimed, based on an array of different MOFs in comparison with alumina, their industrial adsorbent of choice for dehumidification, that all MOFs have superior total capacities, and some also display superior breakthrough behavior, and thus faster kinetics.  454  In addition, cyclic regeneration for MOFs can be achieved with significantly less energy (lower T des ), all in line with preceding findings (desiccant, AHP/AC).  454   The potential of MOFs as adsorbents in adsorption-driven allocation of heat and cold has been thoroughly assessed in this Review. The adsorption mechanism of water on MOFs is known. Water initially adsorbs at specific hydrophilic sites (uncoordinated metal sites, OH-groups on inorganic clusters, or functional groups on the organic ligand). Subsequently, additional water clusters around these initially adsorbed water molecules, after which the pores are filled via volume filling (d p < D c ) or capillary condensation (d p > D c ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[61] [62] [63] [64] [65]  No wonder that MOFs have received attention for application in, for example, adsorption/separation,  [66] [67] [68] [69]  storage,  70, 71  and catalysis.  [72] [73] [74] [75]  In the first part of this Review, we summarize the state of the art in MOF science with regard to stability and adsorption behavior for the aforementioned working fluids. To be able to understand, and to possibly tune, the adsorption of vapors in MOFs, one should have insight into the mechanism of adsorption. This will be described first concerning the experimental and simulation point of view (section 2). Of the utmost importance for the targeted application is further knowledge about the solvothermal (in)stability, as will be discussed second in a clear and concise manner (section 3).

In this section, two major alternative applications will be discussed briefly, and the potential of applying MOFs in these will be concisely assessed. These are thermochemical energy storage (section 7.1) and open cycle dehumidification for air conditioning (section 7.2).\n\nThermochemical Energy Storage\nAs mentioned in section 1, temporary energy storage is required when energy supply and demand are out of phase. Especially thermochemical storage is interesting, as it requires significantly less volume to store the same amount of energy  18, 19  as compared to systems based on latent 20 or sensible energy.  21  Conceptually, sorption-based thermochemical storage follows the same cycle as a heat pump, with the exception that the adsorption and desorption processes are separated by storage time.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

[3]  In spite of versatile advantages of porous MOFs, which include tailor-made pore structures and controllable porosity by change of organic ligands and metal subunits,  [2]  most MOFs suffer from a lack of hydrothermal stability.  [4]  Structural damage to a MOF caused by moisture at processing conditions or during regeneration will strongly limit the utilization of a MOF as a sorbent for industrial applications.  [4]  Conversely, highly porous MOFs with good hydrothermal stability represent candidates for industrially useful water sorbents.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nCubic mesoporous metal(III) di-or tri-carboxylates with hierachical pore structures labeled MIL-101(Cr), MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr), and MIL-100(Al) (MIL stands for Materials of Institut Lavoisier) using trivalent octahedral metals and the simplest aromatic carboxylates such as terepthalate and trimesate have been discovered.  [5, 6]  Based on this requirement, the exceptional hydrothermal stability and large sorption uptakes known for MIL-101 and MIL-100 encouraged us to assess their applicability for water sorption applications.  [5, 6]  Despite studies done on water adsorption in MOFs,  [7]  reports dealing with MOFs as water adsorbents are still scarce  [8]  and there is a particular need to evaluate their low temperature desorption properties, i.e., below 80 \u00b0C for application to energy-efficient dehumidication systems.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis suggests that most of the water molecules are physisorbed on MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe) with a low host-guest interaction (close to the energy of liquefaction) except for the coordinated water molecules, allowing for the low-temperature desorption of water.  designed for a prototype simulation of a household desiccanttype dehumidifier than that with a zeolite rotor, which is commercially available. The detailed results will be published elsewhere. In conclusion, we have unambiguously demonstrated that hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks, MIL-100 and MIL-101 with mesoporous cages behave as advanced water adsorbents applicable to energy-efficient dehumidification. Elaborate investigations of their water sorption properties have shown huge sorption uptakes even at 40 \u00b0C as well as high desorption rates below 80 \u00b0C together with hydrothermal stability. In comparison with the water sorption behaviors of commercial adsorbents such as zeolite NaX, SAPO-34, and silica gel, the improved performance in MIL-100 and MIL-101 demonstrated here suggests commercially viable applications including energyefficient desiccant dehumidification and fresh water production.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

S7), in line with previous findings of a positive correlation between the dendritic spine density of memory engram cells and memory expression triggered by natural recall cues [citation 25].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Labelling and optical erasure of synaptic memory traces in the motor cortex \nAbstract: Dendritic spines are the major loci of synaptic plasticity and are considered as possible structural correlates of memory. Nonetheless, systematic manipulation of specific subsets of spines in the cortex has been unattainable, and thus, the link between spines and memory has been correlational. We developed a novel synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n2c , dendrite #1), while others disappeared (Fig.  2c , dendrites #2 and #3). Importantly, the structural potentiation and AS-PaRac1 labelling triggered during the 'Learning' period were more likely to be preserved than those triggered during the training-free period (Fig.  2j , 'Before' and 'After-1'). Consistently, longitudinal imaging of the structurally potentiated spines revealed that the majority of those with the retention of AS-PaRac1 for 24 h maintained structural potentiation for at least 48 h (Fig.  2k , green trace), while the structurally potentiated spines lacking AS-PaRac1 retention returned to the pre-potentiated state (Fig.  2k , black trace). Such AS-PaRac1 retention might be maintained by reverberation of learning-activated neuronal circuits, because AS-PaRac1 was only expressed in Arc-expressing neurons, in which the persistent activation helps to maintain plastic changes in the neocortex  26, 37  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nl, n ), while re-potentiation was significantly less prominent in mice that did not perform the retraining task (home cage group) (Fig.  5i-k, l , n; Extended Data Fig.  7d, e ). Furthermore, newly potentiated spines, which were not potentiated in the first 2 days, were less abundant in the re-training and home cage groups compared with the dual task group (yellow, Fig.  5m, n ). These findings suggest that reorganisation of distinct synaptic ensembles is specific for each learning task.\n\nDiscussion\nCurrent models of learning and memory suggest that structural plasticity of spines is the underlying mechanism of information storage in the brain. Nonetheless, clear visualization of spine structure in vivo requires the sparse labelling of neurons, and analysis of structural changes in spines is considerably laborious. In contrast, the AS-PaRac1 signal appears as fluorescence puncta, which allows the detection of potentiated spines far more easily, even at high transfection condition. Moreover, the role of potentiated spines can be directly assessed with PA during behavioural examinations.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2a-e ). Consistent with previous findings  33, 34  , even in the training-free period, a substantial number of spines 'spontaneously' underwent structural potentiation (formation or enlargement of spines; see the definition in Extended Data Fig.  4a ), but the trained mice exhibited significantly more structural potentiation compared with the non-trained mice (Fig.  2d ). Notably, synaptic fluorescence of AS-PaRac1 just after training (0 day) strongly correlated with the change in spine size upon training (Fig.  2f ). It is unlikely that the accumulation of AS-PaRac1 caused the potentiation or labelled the spines primed for potentiation such as for the 'tagged synapse'  35, 36  , because the initial quantity of AS-PaRac1 before learning (-1 day) did not correlate with the change in spine size after learning (Fig.  2g ). Analysis of AS-PaRac1 puncta in the dendritic shaft suggested that the majority of AS-PaRac1 signal was located in the dendritic spines, and the labelling of shaft synapses was negligible (Extended Data Fig.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Besides being easy and cheap, the catalyst synthesis is flexible enough to allow further optimization of the porosity and surface area. To date, the true dependence of the structure on the reactivity remains unclear, and further investigations are needed. However, as a comparable material synthesized at higher temperatures (1000 \u00b0C) supports the four-electron process, certain assumptions can be made: (1) Consistent with simulations of Okamoto,  22  an increased nitrogen content may favor the two-electron process. (2) The \"radical\" character of nitrogen-bound carbon, which is essential for the two-electron process,  21  may be more pronounced for meso-BMP-800 because of the lower degree of delocalization. (3) The pyrrolic nitrogen sites within the carbon material elucidated by highresolution XPS, which are not present at higher synthesis temperatures, might indeed contribute in an essential way to the activity of the two-electron process.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAdditionally, the method is very inexpensive (regarding electricity 2.4 EUR cents kg H 2 O 2 -1 at 10 EUR cents kWh -1 industry price), while costs for the transport of liquid hazardous H 2 O 2 could be avoided. As such, precise attribution of the catalytic activity to a specific binding site seems rather speculative. Besides the importance of an increased nitrogen content retaining sufficient conductivity (see ref 22), another possible factor affecting the reactivity is the degree of graphitization. Here, the polarizability of the graphitic layers should influence the adsorption properties, while the elongation of the conjugated \u03c0 system could determine crucial electronic properties. As the radical character of nitrogen-bound carbon may support the two-electron process, less-conjugated \u03c0 systems should be more favored for hydrogen peroxide synthesis.  21  However, nitrogen-doped carbon materials have also received great attention as support materials for metal and metal alloy catalysts, for example, in the methanol oxidation reaction or oxygen reduction to water.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nH ydrogen peroxide is one of the 100 most important chemicals in the world. \n1  The most elegant and efficient reaction pathway would be the direct conversion of elemental hydrogen and oxygen.  2  However, such a process creates the danger of explosion. Electrochemical flow reactors, such as the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), represent an attractive alternative by separating oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation under cogeneration of energy.  3, 4  Therefore continuous research on improving the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide is carried out,  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]  but electrocatalysts still suffer from high costs, limited selectivity or low activity.

NaChBac inactivation kinetics show strong, bell-shaped voltage dependence with characteristic time constants ranging from approximately 50 ms at depolarized voltages to a maximum of approximately 100 s at the inactivation midpoint. Activation and inactivation parameters for four different covalently linked tandem dimer or tandem tetramer constructs were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type channel. Point mutations in the outer part of the pore revealed an important influence of the S195 residue on the process of inactivation. For two mutants (S195D and S195E), the maximal and minimal rates of inactivation observed were increased by approximately 2.5-fold, and the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, compared to the wild-type channel. Our data suggest that pore vestibule structure is an important determinant of NaChBac inactivation, whereas the inactivation mechanism is independent of the number of free cytoplasmic N- and C-termini in the functional channel. In these respects, NaChBac inactivation resembles C-type or slow inactivation modes observed in other voltage-gated K and Na channels. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA second type of inactivation process, usually with significantly slower kinetics, has been observed in a number of channels  (9) (10) (11) . This type of inactivation is called C-type or slow inactivation, with yet a third inactivation process (P-type) also recognized in potassium channels  (12) . Although the detailed mechanisms of slow inactivation processes are incompletely understood, it is believed that rearrangement of the pore, rather than motion of a cytoplasmic region of the channel, is likely to play a central role  (13) (14) (15) . The importance of better understanding of slow inactivation in sodium voltage-gated channels is evident since its alteration is linked to such clinical disorders as periodic paralysis, myotonia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and long-QT syndrome, as recently reviewed by  Vilin and  Ruben  (16) . The prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel (NaCh-Bac) shows homology with eukaryotic voltage-gated channels though its sequence shows closer similarity with calcium channels than with sodium channels  (17) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nINTRODUCTION\nOne of the common properties of voltage-gated channels is their ability to inactivate in response to membrane depolarization. Two general mechanisms of inactivation have been characterized. The first mechanism is usually typified by relatively fast inactivation during a sustained depolarization, effected at the molecular level by a ''ball and chain''  (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)  or ''hinged-lid'' mechanism  (6) . Molecular mechanisms of this type of inactivation, called N-type inactivation, have been studied in detail in K and Na channels. The groups responsible for this type of inactivation are localized at the cytoplasmic side of the channel. For example, in Shaker K-channel, the N-terminal region of the channel plays the role of the ''ball'', which occludes the inner part of the pore after channel activation and thus closes the channel  (7) . A similar mechanism has been described for Na channels. In this case channel block is probably provided by the III-IV interdomain linker latched by a triplet of hydrophobic residues (IFM motif) to form a hinged lid  (8) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nUsing tandem-linked dimers and tetramers, we did not detect any significant difference between inactivation of wild-type channel and the tandem concatemers. Hence, we conclude that, in contrast to N-type inactivation in eukaryotic channels, NaChBac inactivation does not involve either N-or C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of the WT monomer. Slow inactivation in sodium channels may involve a mechanism similar to that of C-type inactivation in potassium channels  (42) . C-type inactivation usually has slower kinetics than N-type and is sensitive to the mutations in the pore region. Similarly, in sodium channels, mutations that change the charge of groups located at the outer side of the selectivity filter change slow-inactivation kinetics  (43) (44) (45) (46) . For example, it was shown that, for the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel, substitution of a negatively charged residue (aspartate) for the alanine at position 1529 of domain IV in the selectivity filter favors ultraslow inactivation  (47) .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

ZnO nanorods were grown on the ZnO seed layer from solution, and their diameters and lengths were controlled by precursor concentration and growth time. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite infiltrated ZnO nanorods showed a power conversion efficiency of 11.13% with short-circuit current density Jsc of 20.08 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage Voc of 991 mV and fill factor of 0.56. Square spectral feature of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was observed, where EQE exceeded 80% in almost the entire wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, and the integrated current density of 20.03 mA/cm2 calculated from EQE data was in good agreement with the observed Jsc. Compared to the perfect spectral response of ZnO nanorods, a perovskite solar cell based on TiO2 nanorods exhibited an integrated current density (16 mA/cm2) much lower than the measured Jsc (20.9 mA/cm2). In addition, time-limited photocurrent response under 530 and 700 nm monochromatic beams at 10 Hz showed that device signal amplitude, associated with charge collection, was rapidly saturated for the ZnO nanorod-based device whereas charge collection was not fully detected for the TiO2 nanorod-based device because of slow collection rate. The current results suggest that ZnO nanorod is an effective charge collection system in CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nFor the case of the electron-injecting oxide system, except for the TiO 2 nanoparticles, one-dimensional TiO 2  [9] [10] [11]  and ZnO 12,13 were investigated. Although electron transport in ZnO was observed to be faster than that in TiO 2 ,  13  photovoltaic performances of ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells were inferior to those of TiO 2 nanorod-based solar cells. This might be due to nonoptimized ZnO nanorods. Here, we report high-efficiency ZnO nanorod-based perovskite solar cells. Diameter and length of the solution-grown ZnO nanorods are controlled by varying the solution concentration and immersion time. PCE of 11.13% is achieved using 1 \u03bcm long ZnO nanorods (diameter of about 80 nm) in the absence of a compact TiO 2 blocking layer. The photovoltaic performance, especially external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectral response is compared between ZnO nanorods and TiO 2 nanorods.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nLength of the solution-grown TiO 2 nanorods is about 1 \u03bcm, and their width is 80-90 nm, as can be seen in Figure  9e . TiO 2 compact layer is clearly seen between TiO 2 nanorods and FTO. A thin spiro-MeOTAD HTM layer is formed over the TiO 2 nanorod film (Figure  9f ). Two-step spin coating of PbI 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in the 1 \u03bcm long TiO 2 nanorod film results in J sc of 20.92 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 869 mV, FF of 0.55, and PCE of 10.02%, which is higher than the previous result for the similar TiO 2 length 9 because of the different coating procedure for the perovskite as mentioned previously. Compared to the ZnO  nanorod, the slightly lower PCE is due to lower V oc , associated with lower conduction band position for the rutile TiO 2 structure and/or enhanced recombination.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n3  It was also confirmed that the perovskite solar cell could work well even without a mesoporous TiO 2 film, where a thin, continuous CH 3 NH 3 PbI 2 Cl layer formed on the Al 2 O 3 surface showed a PCE of 10.9%.  4  Recent progress pushed PCE of perovskite solar cell up to 15%.  5, 6  Thanks to the high open-circuit voltage V oc of perovskite solar cell exceeding 1 V, a PCE of 20% is predicted from perovskite solar cell,  7, 8  which indicates that organometal halide perovskite is a very promising solar cell material. There are two branches in developing perovskite solar cell; one is based on electron-injecting nanostructured oxide layer, and the other is based on nonelectron-injecting scaffold layer (meso-superstructure) or pn junction type planar structure.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We report that single iron sites embedded in a silica matrix enable direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane, exclusively to ethylene and aromatics. The reaction is initiated by catalytic generation of methyl radicals, followed by a series of gas-phase reactions. The absence of adjacent iron sites prevents catalytic C-C coupling, further oligomerization, and hence, coke deposition. At 1363 kelvin, methane conversion reached a maximum at 48.1% and ethylene selectivity peaked at 48.4%, whereas the total hydrocarbon selectivity exceeded 99%, representing an atom-economical transformation process of methane. The lattice-confined single iron sites delivered stable performance, with no deactivation observed during a 60-hour test. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nT he challenge of converting natural gas into transportable fuels and chemicals (1) has been spurred by several emerging industrial trends, including rapidly rising demand for H 2 (for upgrading lower-quality oils) and a global shortage of aromatics caused by shifting refinery targets toward gasoline. Light olefins, which are key chemical feedstocks, are currently made from methanol, which itself is made through multistage catalytic transformations via syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) \n(2, 3) , although there is also ongoing research to convert syngas directly to light olefins  (4, 5) . However, in all such approaches, either CO or H 2 is needed to remove oxygen from CO, resulting in a carbon-atom utilization efficiency below 50%. Despite their low efficiency, high capital and production costs, and enormous CO 2 emissions, syngas routes dominate current and near-term industrial practices for natural gas conversion (6, 7).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nDirect conversion of CH 4 is potentially more economical and environmentally friendly but is challenging because CH 4 exhibits high C-H bond strength (434 kJ/mol), negligible electron affinity, large ionization energy, and low polarizability  (8) . In the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin in the early 1980s, CH 4 was activated with the assistance of oxygen  (9) . This finding initiated a worldwide research surge to explore the high-temperature (>1073 K) oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C 2 hydrocarbons  (10, 11) . Hundreds of catalytic materials have since been synthesized and tested, principally during the 1990s, as well as in recent years. Unfortunately, the presence of O 2 leads irreversibly to overoxidation, resulting in a large amount of the thermodynamically stable endproducts CO 2 and H 2 O. Thus, the carbon utilization efficiency of OCM remains relatively low  (12, 13) . Slow progress in discovering new catalysts to circumvent this problem has hindered further development, and no economically viable process has been put into practice so far.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBy comparison, the catalytically initiated reaction described here compares very favorably with other reported direct-conversion processes, including pyrolysis, OCM  (13) , and nonoxidative aromatization  (21) . Finally, because natural gas usually contains some ethane, we added 1 and 5 vol % ethane to the reactant stream. The presence of ethane substantially enhanced methane conversion (fig.  S2 ) (  22 ), and ethane is almost completely converted, although a small amount of coke is formed at 1173 K and a space velocity of 4.84 liter gcat -1 h -1 . The unprecedented efficiency of the catalytically initiated CH 4 conversion process is attributed to the high activity of the coordinatively unsaturated iron sites toward the C-H bond of CH 4  (28, 29) . The isolated nature of these sites, as evidenced by sub-angstrom-resolution high-angle annular-dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), precludes surface C-C coupling and, hence, coke formation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread pathogen responsible for generally asymptomatic and persistent infections in healthy people. Recent evidence indicates that HCMV gene products are expressed in over 90% of malignant type glioblastomas (GBM). In addition, the HCMV Immediate Early-1 protein (IE1) is expressed in >90% of tumors analyzed.\nMethods: RhoA, RhoB and RhoC were individually depleted in U373MG glioblastoma cells as well as U373MG cells stably expressing the HCMV IE1 protein (named U373MG-IE1 cells) shRNA lentivirus vectors. Cell proliferation assays, migration as well as wound-healing assays were performed in uninfected and HCMV-infected cells.\nResults: The depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC protein resulted in significant alterations in the morphology of the uninfected cells, which were further enhanced by the cytopathic effect caused by HCMV. Furthermore, in the absence or presence of HCMV, the knockdown of RhoB and RhoC proteins decreased the proliferation rate of the parental and the IE1-expressing glioblastoma cells, whereas the knockdown of RhoA protein in the HCMV infected cell lines restored their proliferation rate. In addition, wound healing assays in U373MG cells revealed that depletion of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC differentially reduced their migration rate, even in the presence or the absence of HCMV.\nConclusion: Collectively, these data show for the first time a differential implication of Rho GTPases in morphology, proliferation rate and motility of human glioblastoma cells during HCMV infection, further supporting an oncomodulatory role of HCMV depending on the Rho isoforms' state. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe above observations are consistent with earlier studies depleting the same Rho isoforms both in prostate and breast cancer cells  [59, 62] . The overexpression of HCMV IE1 protein alone did not bring about any additional effect regarding the phenotype of the Rho knockdown cells, thus excluding any direct modulatory role of IE1 on cell morphology. The morphological changes induced in the glioblastoma cells after RhoA and RhoC depletion remained evident, even in the context of HCMV infection, despite the cytopathic effect caused by the virus, highlighting an imposing role Rho GTPases on cell shape. Although Rho GTPases have been shown to enhance malignant transformation and proliferation rate, RhoB is rather assumed as a negative regulator of these processes  [63, 64] . However, recent data have shown that RhoB expression is induced under conditions such as DNA damage, or treatment with growth factors or cytokines, suggesting that under particular circumstances, RhoB may favor towards human malignancy, including glioblastoma tumors  [65, 66] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs regards the U373MG-IE1 cells, the defective closure capacity compared to the empty vector cells was also true when RhoA, RhoB or RhoC were silenced whereas HCMV infection of the same cells resulted in a remarkable increase in the closure efficiency of the wounds (Fig.  7B ). These data collectively indicate that RhoA, RhoB and RhoC play a favorable role in cell migration of glioblastoma overexpressing IE1 protein cells and also that HCMV confers a migration advantage to these cells in Rho proteins depleted cells. \n\nDiscussion\nIn the current study, we demonstrate, for the first time, an implication of Rho GTPases in cell morphology, proliferation and migration in human cytomegalovirus infected glioblastoma cells. Foremost, we observed that knockdown of RhoA resulted in an elongated cell shape with thin protrusions in non-infected and HCMV infected U373MG as well as in their derivative U373MG-IE1 cells. Likewise, depletion of RhoC led the cells to obtain an elongated, mesenchymal-like shape.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe ability of Rho GTPases to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion and cell migration  [10]  marks a central role for these proteins in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The highly conserved RhoA, RhoB and RhoC proteins are frequently aberrantly expressed in human tumours, with RhoA and RhoC being frequently overexpressed whereas RhoB is often downregulated  [11] . RhoA has been implicated in all stages of cancer progression and has an important role during tumour cell proliferation, survival and progression, controlling the generation of epithelial polarity, junction assembly and disruption of epithelial cells  [12] . Furthermore, RhoA is important for both amoeboid and mesenchymal migration through the activation of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway  [13] . On the other hand, RhoC limits to metastasis in cancer progression  [14] . Studies of RhoC deficient mice show that RhoC is required for metastasis but not for the tumour initiation  [14] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Research has mainly focused on increasing the crystallinity of conjugated polymers as a strategy to improve the long-range charge transport properties. Here, we demonstrate that local aggregation over very few chains is a sufficient mesoscopic structure to ensure high mobility, with charge transport mainly occurring along the polymer backbones, and that extended crystallinity is not necessary. These results provide an explanation for the high mobilities observed in seemingly disordered polymers and set molecular-design guidelines for next-generation conjugated polymers. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis observation is confirmed by depth-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements which show the concentrations of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur [elements found in P(NDI2OD-T2)] to be enriched near the surface of the film (Fig.  S4 ). Such vertical phase separation featuring a P(NDI2OD-T2)-rich top layer and a bottom interface primarily composed of PS is attributed to the different surface energies of P(NDI2OD-T2) and PS. Indeed, P(NDI2OD-T2) with a low surface energy (23.7 mJ\u2022m -2 ; ref.  23)  tends to segregate at the air/film interface, whereas PS with higher surface energy (40.2 mJ\u2022m -2 ; ref. 27) prefers the SiO 2 surface. A similar surface-induced phase separation is typically reported for other semiconductor/insulator polymer blends  (28) (29) (30) . A characteristic single-phase morphology with randomly oriented crystalline grains on the order of 10-30 nm is observed in neat films of P(NDI2OD-T2) (Fig.  3A  and Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe successful integration of these properties correlates with the remarkable transport properties of the polymer and serves as a guideline for the rational design of next-generation polymers.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows for a closer view of the top layer morphology for the different P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS ratios (Fig.  3 ).

If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThus no apparatus exists which will amplify an arbitrary polarization. The above argument does not rule out the possibility of a device which can amplify two special polarizations, such as vertical and horizontal. Indeed, any measuring device which distinguishes between these two polarizations, a Nicol prism for example, could be used to trigger such an amplification. The same argument can be applied to any other kind of quantum system. As in the case of photons, linearity does not forbid the amplification of any given state by a device designed especially for that state, but it does rule out the existence of a device capable of amplifying an arbitrary state. Nature Vol. 299 28 October 1982 Milonni (unpublished work) has shown that the process of stimulated emission does not lead to quantum amplification, because if there is stimulated emission there must also be-with equal probability in the case of one incoming photon-spontaneous emission, and the polarization of a spontaneously emitted photon is entirely independent of the polarization of the original. It is conceivable that a more sophisticated amplifying apparatus could get around Milonni's argument.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNote that if photons could be cloned, a plausible argument could be made for the possibility of faster-than-light communication 2 \u2022 It is well known that for certain non-separably correlated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of photons, once an observer has made a polarization measurement (say, vertical versus horizontal) on one member of the pair, the other one, which may be far away, can be for all purposes of prediction regarded as having the same polarization 3 \u2022 If this second photon could be replicated and its precise polarization measured as above, it would be possible to ascertain whether, for example, the first photon had been subjected to a measurement of linear or circular polarization. In this way the first observer would be able to transmit information faster than light by encoding his message into his choice of measurement. The actual impossibility of cloning photons, shown below, thus prohibits superluminal communication by this scheme.

H.

Here, we review recent progress in this field that demonstrates great potential of PFM for the investigation of static and dynamic properties of ferroelectric domains, nanofabrication and lithography, local functional control, and structural imaging in a variety of inorganic and organic materials, including piezoelectrics, semiconductors, polymers, biomolecules, and biological systems. Future pathways for PFM application in high-density data storage, nanofabrication, and spectroscopy are discussed. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPFM studies of static and dynamic properties of ferroelectric domains are summarized in this article.\n\nIntroduction\nOver the last two decades, scanning probe microscopy has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of fundamental phenomena in many fields, including superconductivity, spin-resolved transport, charge density wave transitions, protein folding, chemical sensing, and catalysis. A particularly interesting case is piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which is unique in that it probes a tensorial property, the coupling between electric field and mechanical strain. While the first and most obvious application of this technique is to straightforwardly map domains in ferroelectric materials, PFM does much more both in terms of the information content and of applications. Coupling between electric fields and mechanical strain underpins a broader range of phenomena in ferroelectrics and other polar materials. This article highlights recent examples in which PFM directly probes electromechanical interactions in systems ranging from complex ferroelectric materials and piezoelectric compounds to biological tissues. These examples also illustrate that creative variants of PFM or a quantitative approach to data analysis contribute to a fundamental understanding of complex phenomena in solids.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn comparison, both vertical PFM (VPFM) and lateral PFM (LPFM) images show a very strong electromechanical response attributed to the presence of protein (presumably ameliogenin) fibrils embedded within a nonpiezoelectric hydroxyapatite matrix (Figure  8d  and 8e ). The spatial resolution of PFM, determined as a halfwidth of the boundary between different piezoelectric regions, is ~5 nm. Note that the resolution achieved is comparable to the best results to date achieved for thin films of ferroelectric perovskites. Comparison of the VPFM and LPFM images shows a different pattern of piezoelectric domains, suggesting a complicated structure of the fibrils, consisting of several protein molecules. The color encoded vector piezoresponse map (vector PFM), shown in Figure  8f , clearly delineates the helical structure, visualizing the electromechanically active protein fibril conformation in real space.\n\nPFM Manipulation and Lithography\nPatterning ferroelectric domains to engineer devices is a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n80  Notably, in highquality epitaxial films, the spatial separation between extended defects such as dislocations can exceed 100 nm,  81  as compared to the ~10-30-nm size of domains detectable by PFM. This comparison suggests that switching can potentially be studied on the level of a single defect.  82  The combination of SS-PFM on artificially engineered defect structures in a bicrystal grain boundary with phase field modeling  83  has provided the ability to decipher deterministic mesoscopic polarization switching in ferroelectrics (Figure  12 ).\n\nGeneral Outlook\nWhile one's initial impression of electromechanical interactions may be that they are significant only in ferroelectric compounds, this is not true. Coupled electromechanical properties are inherent in hundreds of inorganic materials and similarly in biological materials. The evolution of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) provides a new window into the behavior of a wide range of materials. Equally important, the developments in PFM are part of a larger trend toward extreme high-spatial resolution in the quantification of electromagnetic properties.  84  Several classes of properties are now probed at subnanometer resolution.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We found that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, is a ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 23 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], high Curie temperature of 426 kelvin (above that of BTO), large dielectric constant, and low dielectric loss. DIPAB exhibits good piezoelectric response and well-defined ferroelectric domains. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to perovskite ferroelectrics and ferroelectric polymers in sensing, actuation, data storage, electro-optics, and molecular or flexible electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nP s is measured to be 23 mC cm -2 , compared to 8 mC cm -2 for PVDF (4), 26 mC cm -2 for BTO (4), 30 to 55 mC cm -2 for PZT  (21) , and 8 mC cm -2 for DIPAC  (13) . We also observed that the variation of P s with respect to temperature is very similar to that of c (2) , which can be explained from the relationship c (2) = 6e 0 bP s deduced from Landau theory, where b is the high-order dielectric coefficient  (1, 19) . To verify our measurement of spontaneous polarization, we performed first-principles density functional theory  (22, 23)  calculations within the generalized gradient approximation to the exchange correlation potential according to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method  (24)  and the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid (HSE) functional  (25) . The spontaneous polarization (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFerroelectricity was originally discovered in Rochelle salt  (8)  in 1921 and later in a few other molecular systems  (9) , but the rapid development of ferroelectrics took place only after the discovery of ferroelectricity in perovskite barium titanate (BTO)  (10)  and lead zirconate titanate (PZT)  (11) . Relative to BTO and PZT, most  molecular ferroelectrics suffer from low spontaneous polarization (P s ), low melting temperature and phase transition temperature (Curie temperature, T c ), small dielectric constant, and weak piezoelectricity; their advantages include light weight, mechanical flexibility, and environmentally friendly processing as they are lead-free. Ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers  (12)  share some of the drawbacks of molecular ferroelectrics, which limits their applications.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe recently reported croconic acid (6) has a high spontaneous polarization of around 23 mC cm -2 ; however, evidence for a ferroelectric phase transition, piezoelectric response, or ferroelectric domains has not been reported. By searching among organic compounds with a polar point group at room temperature and relatively high melting point, we found that diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPAC) is a ferroelectric with spontaneous polarization of 8.2 mC cm -2 (13). Here, we show that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB), a molecular crystal processed from aqueous solution, possesses ferroelectric properties comparable to those of BTO. A crystalline sample of DIPAB was grown by slow evaporation of the aqueous solution; the recrystallization of DIPAB yields two different polymorphs  (14) . One (1-F), obtained from methanol, is needle-shaped, whereas the other (1-P), obtained from water or a methanol-water solu-tion, has a block shape (fig.  S1 ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

DNA structures have largely remained limited to in vitro applications  (9) . RNA provides a compatible material for in vivo nucleic acid based construction  (10) . It can be produced via the transcription machinery, and forms stable interactions. RNA has been used to build higher-order assemblies in vitro  (11, 12)  and can potentially be used in vivo to engineer the intracellular environment. Here, we engineered synthetic RNA modules that assemble into functional discrete, one-, and two-dimensional scaffolds in vivo, and used them to control the spatial organization of bound proteins (Fig.  1A ). Scaffold D0 was constructed from a single RNA module d0, which folded into a duplex with PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains that bind PP7 and MS2 fusion proteins (Fig.  1B )  (13) . We developed an approach for the in vivo isothermal assembly of extended RNA scaffolds by constructing sequence-symmetric RNA building blocks (Fig.  1, C  and D ) inspired by two-dimensional DNA analogs  (13, 14) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe torsion in d1-2 induced folding into an RNA nanotube capable of growing into the onedimensional scaffold D1 (step iv).

The dormant tile d2' spontaneously generated the pro-tile d2-1 (step i), which interacted with d2'' to generate tile d2-2 (step ii). d2-2 then self-assembled into the two-dimensional RNA scaffold D2 with PP7 and MS2 binding domains (step iv). In vitro transcribed RNA modules d1 and d2'/d2'' were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). d1 formed one-dimensional RNA fibers D1, while d2'/d2'' assembled into two-dimensional extended RNA fibers D2 (Fig.  2A ). The width of D1 (~5 nm, a few tiles wide) is smaller than that of its DNA analog  (14) , and might thus also correspond to one-dimensional ribbons D1 2 constructed from a continuous line of single-tiles (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe rules of nucleic acid base-pairing have been used to construct nanoscale architectures and organize biomolecules, but little has been done to apply this technology in vivo.

Tough hydrogels are formed, depending on the concentration of ZnSO 4 present in the system. D) When the interpenetrating network hydrogel is stretched and relaxed, the phase transitioned ELP can be disrupted and reformed, respectively. Reversible decrosslinking/ crosslinking also occurs within the MCP network while the CCP network maintains elasticity throughout.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIt is notable that the level of adhesion strength achieved here is much higher than recently developed nanoparticle adhesives for gels and biological tissues,  [34]  although it is lower than the adhesion of tough hydrogels on various nonporous solid surfaces recently achieved.  [35, 36]  Further investigation into the relative contributions of the metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions to enhance adhesion will be considered in future studies. In summary, we have demonstrated that genetically engineered unstructured proteins with covalent and reversible crosslinking (due to metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions) yield hydrogels with extremely high strength (>2.5 MPa), toughness (>1300 J m -2 ), stretchability (>500%), and self-adhesion in Zn 2+ solutions. A number of future research directions now become possible in both the fundamental understanding of the physical properties of protein-based materials and their practical applications. While we have used reversible metal coordination and hydrophobic interactions for mechanical-energy dissipation to toughen our networks, other reversible crosslinking mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding and ionic crosslinking can also be precisely designed through genetic encoding of recombinant proteins.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDOI: 10.1002/adma.201604743\nstretchability, insensitivity to structural defects, and the capacity for self-healing.

A modular and tunable approach towards design of built-to-order nanoparticle systems, spray coating on PRINT\u00ae particles is demonstrated to achieve technologies capable of targeted interactions with cancer cells for applications in drug delivery. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n\u03b6-potential, measured at 25\u00b0C in 10mM NaCl, of pre-and post-XL NPs are approximately the same, while deposition of materials post-XL results in surface charge characteristics consistent with the material deposited (see Supplemental Figure  4 ). A range of polyelectrolyte multilayers were explored, including poly-L-lysine (PLL)/hyaluronic acid (HA) [PLL/HA 500K ], PLL/dextran sulfate (DXS) [PLL/DXS], PLL/poly(acrylic acid) [PLL/PAA], chitosan/HA [Chit/HA 500K ], and chitosan/PAA [Chit/PAA] (see Supplemental Figure  4 ), further illustrating a primary advantage of LbL as a means of tailoring the surface properties of these NP systems. These films, while diverse in the range of materials incorporated, behaved similarly in coating the NP systems without compromising the particle shape or significantly increasing the size beyond a few tens of nanometers. Recovered and purified particles visualized by electron microscopy, including SEM and TEM, are displayed in Figures  3  and 4 .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs a result, the cross-linked films can be placed in water without particle detachment. Following crosslinking, it was observed that particles could be readily functionalized, as evidenced by maintenance of iridescence from the NP array following each processing step (Figure  1E, 1F ). This step therefore allowed for the deposition of water-based polyelectrolytes using Spray-LbL. As shown in Scheme 1, Spray-LbL on PRINT\u00ae nanoparticles, following vapor-phase crosslinking of the PVA support films, is achieved by spraying an aqueous solution of cationic polyelectrolyte is sprayed onto the NP containing films for 3 seconds and, after briefly rinsing with water (3 seconds), an anionic polyelectrolyte is subsequently sprayed onto the films (3 seconds). This cycle can then be repeated indefinitely to control the thickness of the polyelectrolyte coating. In the final step, the particles are harvested by sonicating the films in water, which causes the particles to detach from the PVA substrate.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor both particle types, uniformity of the particle population is maintained as evidenced by the PDI of functionalized particles (see Table  1 : PRINT\u00ae PLGA 200\u00d7200nm particles -original 0.01, 0.06 following deposition of three bilayers of PLL/HA 500K ; PRINT\u00ae PLGA80\u00d7320nm particles -original 0.05). A slight decrease in size following crosslinking is observed for both particle types, consistent with the amount of material exposure to the crosslinking contraction forces on the PVA adhesive layer. The change in size for functionalized particles is indicative of a very thin LbL film, approximately 15-20nm for 3 bilayers of PLL/HA 500K , based on dynamic light scattering (Table  1 ) and confirmed with electron microscopy (Figures  3, 4 ). Histogram overlays also illustrate the thin coatings applied to the particle surface (Supplemental Figure  4 ).

Phonons in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were recently found to exhibit unique thickness dependence due to the interplay between short and long range interactions. Here we report Raman spectra of atomically thin sheets of WS2 and WSe2, isoelectronic compounds of MoS2, in the mono- to few-layer thickness regime. We show that, similar to the case of MoS2, the characteristic A1g and E2g(1) modes exhibit stiffening and softening with increasing number of layers, respectively, with a small shift of less than 3 cm(-1) due to large mass of the atoms. Thickness dependence is also observed in a series of multiphonon bands arising from overtone, combination, and zone edge phonons, whose intensity exhibit significant enhancement in excitonic resonance conditions. Some of these multiphonon peaks are found to be absent only in monolayers. These features provide a unique fingerprint and rapid identification for monolayer flakes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe difference in the frequency of these peaks is 60 and 65 cm -1 for monolayer and bulk samples, respectively (Figure  2b ).

Raman spectra of WSe 2 flakes measured in two polarization configurations and with 633 nm excitation are shown in Figure  3a . In contrast to the case in WS 2 , the parallel polarization spectra of WSe 2 flakes exhibit one prominent peak with a small shoulder in the frequency region where 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks are expected to be observed  57  . The main peak upshifts from 249.5 to 251 cm -1 with increasing flake thickness from monolayer to bulk. In cross polarized spectra, a single peak is observed in this frequency region.

Monolayer WX 2 belongs to 3h D point group and has 9 modes at the Brillouin zone center.  43  The rigid layer shear mode E peaks that are clearly separated and of similar intensity (Figure  1c ). In contrast, only one prominent peak can be clearly seen in bulk WSe 2 spectrum in the frequency region where we expect 1g A and 1 2 g E peaks  57  (See Supporting Information). In 633 nm excitation condition, however, multiple peaks are evident in this region (Figure  1d ). There have been inconsistent reports on the assignment of these peaks  7, 31, 32, 47  . We demonstrate below that two peaks found at 248 and 250 cm -1 are 1 2 g\n\nE and 1g\nA peaks in agreement with the previous study by Mead and Irwin  57  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe peak intensity is normalized in Figure  3a  to show this trend. The opposite thickness dependence and polarization dependence indicates that they are indeed 1g A and 1 2 g E modes. The peak at 257 cm -1 did not show consistent polarization dependence, as shown in the Figure  S2  of the Supporting Information. This peak was reported to be the 1g A phonon by some groups  7, 31, 47  . As shown in Figure1 and Figure  S2 , this peak is very broad, which is uncharacteristic for a first order Raman peak, and shows only weak dependence on the polarization configuration. It is assigned to the 2LA(M) phonon here according the theoritical calculation  59  . Similar to MoS 2 and WS 2 , the 1g A ( 1 2 g E ) phonon of WSe 2 stiffens (softens) with increase in flake thickness (Figure  3b ). The key difference is that the two modes become virtually degenerate in the single layer limit.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we analysed variation at eight microsatellite loci to assess the genetic structure and to infer patterns of larval dispersal for a brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, at an isolated system of reefs in northern Western Australia. Spatial autocorrelation analyses show that populations are locally subdivided, and that the majority of larvae recruit to within 100 m of their natal colony. Further, a combination of F- and R- statistics showed significant differentiation at larger spatial scales (2-60 km) between sites, and this pattern was clearly not associated with distance. However, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled. Individual assignments of these migrants to the most likely populations suggest that the majority of migrants were produced at the only site that was not decimated by a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching event. Furthermore, the only site that recovered to prebleaching levels received most of these immigrants. We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNevertheless, despite these differences between the two studies, our results not only support the finding of high levels of genetic differentiation by  Ayre & Dufty (1994) , but also extend our understanding of the processes underlying these patterns, by providing direct evidence that populations are subdivided on a scale of tens of metres. Consequently, the conclusion that the majority of brooded larvae produced by S. hystrix settle very close to their natal colony is now well supported in two very different ecological systems, irrespective of local environmental conditions and history. Disturbance, broader scale dispersal, and source/sink dynamics Despite this preponderance of local recruitment over scales of tens of metres, we have also presented evidence that S. hystrix larvae periodically disperse over much greater distances. The pairwise F-and R-statistics indicated that some sites separated by relatively large distances were more closely related than those that were nearer to each other. For example, the pairwise R ST comparison between SL4 and SS3 was not significant. Thus, sufficient gene flow over the 40 km of open water between Seringapatam and Scott Reef has prevented genetic differentiation, assuming that the mutation process conforms to the stepwise mutation model.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn particular, several tests are now available that can assign individuals to their population of origin, from which present day migration patterns can be inferred  (Waser & Strobeck 1998) . Although the development of high resolution DNA markers in scleractinian corals has been difficult  (Marquez et al . 2002) , recent progress has been made  (Magalon et al . 2003; Miller & Howard 2004; Baums et al . 2005a; Underwood et al . 2006 ). Here, we present biological data utilizing the microsatellites developed by  Underwood et al . (2006)  to investigate the pattern of genetic connectivity among populations of the brooding pocilloporid Seriatopora hystrix within the Scott Reef system in northern Western Australia. The life history characteristics and genetic structure of S. hystrix suggest that the majority of dispersal is local. Larvae are produced sexually through internal fertilization of the eggs, are brooded within the polyp, and then released into the water column at an advanced developmental stage.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis conclusion was supported by the correlograms from individual sites (not shown). While having less statistical power, these correlograms from each site showed similar patterns to the combined correlogram; five of the six sites exhibited maximum positive genetic correlation over the first few distance classes, which then declined to become negative at distance classes greater than 100 m. The common occurrence of heterozygote deficits observed here further emphasizes the localized nature of recruitment in this species. As shown with allozymes in S. hystrix on the GBR  (Ayre & Dufty 1994) , we observed heterozygote deficits at most sites. Heterozygote deficits are commonly found in brooding and broadcasting hard corals  (Ayre & Hughes 2000; Gilmour 2002; Mackenzie et al. 2004; Whitaker 2004; Maier et al. 2005; Nishikawa & Sakai 2005)  and in marine species in general  (Tracey et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we report nanoscale nickel oxide/nickel heterostructures formed on carbon nanotube sidewalls as highly effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction with activity similar to platinum. Partially reduced nickel interfaced with nickel oxide results from thermal decomposition of nickel hydroxide precursors bonded to carbon nanotube sidewalls. The metal ion-carbon nanotube interactions impede complete reduction and Ostwald ripening of nickel species into the less hydrogen evolution reaction active pure nickel phase. A water electrolyzer that achieves ~20 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.5 V, and which may be operated by a single-cell alkaline battery, is fabricated using cheap, non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nHigh-resolution STEM imaging (Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  1 ) and the corresponding chemical mapping (Fig.  1d ) showed that the NiO shell was not uniform, containing small NiO grains with different orientations and might contain small gaps in the shell to expose some NiO/Ni nano-interfaces (Fig.  1c ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the NiO-Ni structure (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). The as-made material exhibited mostly Ni 2 \u00fe species on the surface with a weak shoulder peak at B853 eV from Ni 0 . On Ar ion sputtering of the surface, the detected Ni species were mostly Ni 0 with decreased amount of Ni 2 \u00fe , consistent with NiO-decorated Ni nanoparticles. The Ni K edge spectrum of the sample recorded by X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) further corroborated the co-existence of NiO and Ni (Supplementary Fig.  2b ). Since Ni K edge probed deeper into the material, we could estimate the Ni/NiO ratio B73/27 by linear fitting of standard patterns.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSynergistic effects of NiO and Ni on HER catalysis. When annealed at 300 \u00b0C at a higher Ar pressure of 1 atm (in contrast toB1.5 torr for producing NiO/Ni-CNT), the same Ni(OH) 2 precursors on CNTs was transformed to pure 3-4 nm NiO nanoparticles (NiO/CNT; Fig.  2b  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ), suggesting no Ni 2 \u00fe reduction under a high annealing pressure with the release of oxygen gas. On the other hand, Ni 2 \u00fe reduction was accelerated by raising the annealing temperature to 500 \u00b0C in B1.5 torr Ar, generating Ni nanoparticles (mostly410 nm particles) nearly free of NiO on CNTs (Ni/CNT; Fig.  2c  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The Ni surface oxidation state on NiO/CNT and Ni/CNT were confirmed to be \u00fe 2 and 0, respectively, by XPS and XANES spectra (Fig.  2g, h ) and by EELS chemical mapping (Fig.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2g, h ) and by EELS chemical mapping (Fig.  2e ,f and Supplementary Figs  5  and 6 ). The NiO/CNT material afforded a much larger overpotential of B400 mV, despite a smaller Tafel slope and CNT alone showed negligible HER current density before \u00c0 0.5 V versus RHE (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The Ni/CNT hybrid gave similar Tafel slope in HER but a larger overpotential of B130 mV than the B0 mV overpotential for NiO/Ni-CNT. This advantage was partially attributed to the higher surface area of NiO/Ni-CNT (152.2 m 2 g \u00c0 1 ) compared with that of Ni/CNT (86.5 m 2 g \u00c0 1 ; Supplementary Fig.  8a ). With current density normalized to the surface area instead of the geometric area, NiO/Ni-CNT still outperformed Ni/CNT by B100 mV (Supplementary Fig.  8b ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These results do not support the notion of a \"slowdown\" in the increase of global surface temperature. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nReports\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report  (1)  concluded that the global surface temperature \"has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past  15 years [1998-2012]  than over the past 30 to 60 years.\" The more recent trend was \"estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend over 1951-2012.\" The apparent slowdown was termed a \"hiatus,\" and inspired a suite of physical explanations for its cause, including changes in radiative forcing, deep ocean heat uptake, and atmospheric circulation changes  (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . While these analyses and theories have considerable merit in helping to understand the global climate system, other important aspects of the \"hiatus\" related to observational biases in global surface temperature data have not received similar attention. In particular, residual data biases in the modern era could well have muted recent warming, and as stated by IPCC, the trend period itself was short and commenced with a strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1998.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nGiven recent improvements in the observed record  (13, 14)  and additional years of global data (including a record-warm 2014), we reexamine the observational evidence related to a \"hiatus\" in recent global surface warming. The data used in our long-term global temperature analysis primarily involve surface air temperature observations taken at thousands of weather observing stations over land, and for coverage across oceans, the data are sea surface temperature (SST) observations taken primarily by thousands of commercial ships and drifting surface buoys. These networks of observations are always undergoing change. Changes of particular importance include: (i) an increasing amount of ocean data from buoys, which are slightly differ-ent than data from ships; (ii) an increasing amount of ship data from engine intake thermometers, which are slightly different than data from bucket sea-water temperatures; and (iii) a large increase in land-station data that enables better analysis of key regions that may be warming faster or slower than the global average. We address all three of these, none of which were included in our previous analysis used in the IPCC report  (1) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is evident that in most latitude bands, the global trends in the past 15 years are comparable to trends in the preceding 50 years. Finally, we consider the impact of larger warming rates in high latitudes  (24)  on the overall global trend. To estimate the magnitude of the additional warming, we applied large-area interpolation over the poles using the limited observational data available. Results (Fig.  1 ) indicate that, indeed, additional global warming of a few hundredths of a degree Celsius per decade over the 21st century is evident, providing further evidence against the notion of a recent warming \"hiatus.\" See supplemental materials for details. In summary, newly corrected and updated global surface temperature data from NOAA's NCEI do not support the notion of a global warming \"hiatus.\" As shown in Fig.  1 , there is no discernable (statistical or otherwise) decrease in the rate of warming between the second half of the 20th century and the first 15 years of the 21st century.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn summary, the choice of the descriptors is of vital importance because it is the set of descriptors to which the energy is assigned. The number of descriptors has an immediate impact on the feasibility of any ML potential, as it does not only restrict the efficiency of the energy evaluation but also determines the dimensionality of the coordinate space to be mapped by the training sets. On the other hand, the number of descriptors must be sufficiently large to enable an unambiguous distinction of different structures. In Secs. II B 1-II B 4 several descriptors which have been developed for ML potentials are discussed. This list is by far not complete, and there are plenty of new interesting approaches, which have been proposed recently, like moment tensors,  30  scattering transforms,  31  and many others.\n\nB. Descriptors for machine learning potentials\n\n\nAtom centered symmetry functions\nA ML approach applicable to high-dimensional systems containing large numbers of atoms has been proposed by Behler and Parrinello in 2007 employing NNs.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n45, 46  Starting with NNs 32 in 2007, several different ML approaches suitable for high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms have now become available  38, 40  and are still evolving rapidly.  10, 47, 48  An overview about the increasing use of different ML techniques to the construction of PESs is shown in Fig.  1 . In this section, several ML methods along with their use in the construction of PESs are outlined, which in principle could be combined almost arbitrarily with the descriptors discussed above. Still, currently there are a few dominant combinations of descriptors and ML methods, but this is not because of the compatibility or incompatibility of the different approaches, but it is mainly a consequence of the personal preferences of the developers. \n\nB. Neural networks\nArtificial neural networks are the oldest ML method  49  and they have first been developed to understand the signal processing in the brain. They also represent the first ML method which has been used to fit a DFT PES by Doren and coworkers in 1995,  26  and to date a large number of NN potentials have been developed for many molecular and condensed systems.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe set of descriptors plays a central role, not only in the construction of PESs,  21  but also beyond in applications like structure-property relationships for property prediction in materials science  22  and also in the strongly related older field of QSAR.  23  Further applications with similar requirements regarding the structural description are the analysis of MD trajectories, the screening of large numbers of atomic configurations for certain features, and structure identification in general.  24  Even the collective variables used in simulation techniques like metadynamics have similar requirements.  25  The substantial challenge of finding suitable descriptors for ML potentials has been recognized in the advent of the first NN potentials about 20 years ago,  26  which initially have been developed for rather low-dimensional systems like small molecules and diatomic molecules interacting with frozen surfaces. As NNs, like all other ML methods, process ordered vectors of numbers, the output is not invariant with respect to any permutation of the position of equivalent atoms in the structure. Further, directly available descriptors of the atomic positions like Cartesian coordinates are not invariant with respect to translation and rotation of the system, while the resulting ML potential must possess these properties.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The key concept involves self-generation of auxiliary evanescent fields which facilitate the required local power conservation, without interfering with the device performance in the far field. We demonstrate our scheme by presenting exact reactive solutions to the challenging problems of reflectionless beam splitting and perfect reflection, verified via full wave simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis recognition has dramatic implications. For instance, when the GSTCs for passive lossless HMSs are rigorously examined, it turns out that plane-wave refraction cannot in general be realized with zero reflection, as the metasurface symmetric structure can only be matched to a single wave impedance value  [7, 19] . Indeed, the formulation in  [18]  showed that sufficient conditions to ensure passive and lossless design in this case include local power conservation and local wave-impedance equalization, requiring at least one additional diffraction mode, e.g. specular reflection. Although this reflection is minor for small-tomoderate angle refraction, it becomes significant when wide-angle refraction is considered. These observations raised serious questions regarding previously-reported achievements. Primarily, could passive lossless metasurfaces achieve truly-reflectionless engineered refraction? In a recent paper, Wong et al.  [20]  provided a positive answer to that question.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[20]  provided a positive answer to that question. Relying on generalized scattering matrix theory, the authors showed that an asymmetric stacking of three reactance sheets could be designed to simultaneously match the wave impedance of both the incident and refracted plane waves, leading to zero reflections even in the case of wide-angle refraction. This approach was generalized in  [21] , showing that this structure corresponds to an omega-type bianisotropic metasurface (O-BMS). In O-BMSs, meta-atoms exhibit electric and magnetic polarizabilities as in HMSs, but also feature magnetoelectric coupling  [2, 22] . This additional degree of freedom allows passive and lossless implementation of metasurfaces which are matched to different wave impedances on their top and bottom facets; similarly, O-BMSs can be used for achieving asymmetric reflection properties  [23] . The wave impedance perspective, thus, can be used to find a passive and lossless solution for transforming a given incident plane wave to a desirable transmitted plane wave. But what happens when more than one mode exists below or above the metasurface?\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThin planar arrangements of polarizable subwavelength particles (metasurfaces) have been attracting significant attention lately due to their demonstrated ability to efficiently implement a variety of electromagnetic functionalities \n[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Many innovative low-profile devices manipulating the phase, magnitude, and polarization of aperture fields have been reported in recent years  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , pointing out the immense potential of these surfaces in optics and microwave physics and engineering. While the first demonstrations used a single layer of electrically polarizable particles (meta-atoms)  [6] , it was soon found that these suffer from a limited transmission efficiency. To achieve a unity transmission magnitude with arbitrary transmission phase, both electrically and magnetically polarizable meta-atoms must be used  [8, 9, 17] . When illuminated by an incident field, such metasurfaces induce orthogonal electric and (equivalent) magnetic currents on the surface, forming Huygens' sources, capable of unidirectional radiation (i.e., full transmission)  [9] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles, birds (sampled with point-counts PC and mist net-MN), saplings, and trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and recurrent-burned forest were higher than between control and once-burned forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation communities in recurrent-burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms acting behind them. Policy-makers need to explicitly address protection of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nMANY TROPICAL FORESTS MAY HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY FIRES THAT OC-CURRED ONCE OR TWICE PER MILLENNIUM\n  (Turcq et al. 1998 , Bush et al. 2008 , McMichael et al. 2012) . However, in recent decades, especially in Brazil and Indonesia, fire-return intervals have become decadal or even shorter in some forests  (Cochrane 2003 , Langner & Siegert 2009) . This increase in fire prevalence is primarily caused by an increase in ignition sources from agricultural activities that use fire as a tool for land management  (Laurance 2004 , Cardoso et al. 2008 , Morton et al. 2013 ) and an increase in forest flammability from other human activities, such as logging and fragmentation  (Cochrane 2001 , Siegert et al. 2001) . In addition, fires are often associated with severe droughts  (Chen et al. 2011) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2011) . For example, around 2.6 million hectares and 3.9 million hectares of forest were burned during El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in Indonesia and Brazilian Amazon  (Siegert et al. 2001 , Alencar et al. 2006, respectively) . Most of the predictions of fires associated to climate changes and human land uses in general, state that such events may occur more often in the coming years (e.g.,  Cochrane & Barber 2009 , Fu et al. 2013) , affecting not only Amazon forest, but also the hyper-fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, the interactions between human economic activities, climate change, and fire pose a serious threat for tropical forests. One of the consequences of this increase in fire-return intervals is an increase in the area of forests being subjected to repeated burns, which can alter forest structure and composition when compared to single burns  (Barlow & Peres 2008) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \n2005) . Recurrent fires may reach into the forest canopy, killing many mid-sized, and large trees and most of the remaining aboveground biomass  (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998 , Cochrane et al. 1999 , Peres 1999 , Cochrane 2003) . While the effects of single fires on tropical forests are relatively well described, much less is known about recurrent fires. For example, single fires change the plant, bird and leaf litter ant species composition  (Barlow et al. 2002 , Barlow & Peres 2008 , Silveira et al. 2013, respectively) , reduce sapling, seedling and tree densities  (Clearly et al. 2006) , and cause substantial reptile mortality  (Kinnaird & O'Brien 1998) . Existing studies on the impacts of recurrent fires are primarily focused on plants (e.g.,  Cochrane & Schulze 1999 , Barlow et al. 2003a ,b, Haugaasen et al. 2003a , Slik & Eichhorn 2003 , Toma et al.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Nevertheless, dendrite growth, side reactions and infinite relative volume change have prevented it from practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a promising metallic lithium anode design by infusing molten lithium into a polymeric matrix. The electrospun polyimide employed is stable against highly reactive molten lithium and, via a conformal layer of zinc oxide coating to render the surface lithiophilic, molten lithium can be drawn into the matrix, affording a nano-porous lithium electrode. Importantly, the polymeric backbone enables uniform lithium stripping/plating, which successfully confines lithium within the matrix, realizing minimum volume change and effective dendrite suppression. The porous electrode reduces the effective current density; thus, flat voltage profiles and stable cycling of more than 100 cycles is achieved even at a high current density of 5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 in both carbonate and ether electrolyte. The advantages of the porous, polymeric matrix provide important insights into the design principles of lithium metal anodes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nOn one hand, the use of solid electrolytes to suppress dendrite propagation remains premature in the current stage  [15] [16] [17]  , for they often fall short of meeting the high-power requirement at ambient temperature due to limited ionic conductivity  18, 19  , together with issues such as large interfacial impedance  20, 21  . On the other hand, the most common approaches to dendrite mitigation in liquid electrolyte focus on the stabilization of SEI via adjusting the electrolyte composition and additives  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  . Though proven to be effective, most additives will be continuously consumed during battery cycling so that the suppression effect is not fully sustainable  [27] [28] [29]  . Alternatively, the application of a mechanically stable artificial SEI coating such as polymer or solid-state blocking layers has been proposed  [30] [31] [32] [33]  .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor example, a promising nanoscale interfacial engineering approach has been demonstrated recently based on interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres, ultrathin two-dimensional boron nitride or oxidized polyacrylonitrile fibres to control the dendrite growth and improve the cycling CE  [34] [35] [36]  . Nevertheless, all these studies adopted the galvanostatic Li plating/stripping approach on a current collector, which is still unable to address the issue of infinite volume change since the electrodes expand during Li plating and shrink during stripping. In addition, contrary to Li-ion batteries where Li ions are stored in prelithiated cathodes, many of the intensively studied high-energy-density battery chemistries (e.g., Li-air and Li-S) involve cathodes in the nonlithiated form. Therefore, it is apparent that a metallic Li anode design with no volume change at the whole-electrode scale and long-term cycling stability in liquid electrolyte is of paramount research importance  3  . Herein, we demonstrate a rational design of metallic Li anode that successfully achieves minimum volume change at the wholeelectrode level and stable, dendrite-free Li cycling.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSeveral important design principles are employed. Firstly, in order to realize negligible volume change, a chemically as well as electrochemically stable matrix is required to sustain a constant electrode volume during cycling. In addition, complete confinement of Li within the matrix is necessary to preserve a constant electrode dimension; therefore, the direct nucleation of Li on the top surface of the matrix should be prevented, as reported in previous studies  31, 34  . Moreover, a porous electrode is desirable since a reduced local current density is beneficial to alleviate dendrite propagation  37, 38  . Following the aforementioned rationale, a Li-coated polyimide (PI) matrix design for metallic Li anode is proposed. The electrospun polymeric fibres guarantee a chemically and electrochemically inert matrix, which is favourable to confine the stripping/plating of Li solely within the matrix. Notably, the choice of PI is rather unique for it is one of the only few high-performance polymers that exhibit excellent chemical stability, heat resistance and mechanical strength above the melting point of Li (180 \u00b0C)  39  . However, the wetting of molten Li on PI polymer is poor.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

However, dendrite growth and limited Coulombic efficiency during cycling have prevented its practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we report that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt enables the high-rate cycling of a lithium metal anode at high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.1%) without dendrite growth. With 4\u2009M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the electrolyte, a lithium|lithium cell can be cycled at 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 6,000 cycles, and a copper|lithium cell can be cycled at 4\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for more than 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4%. These excellent performances can be attributed to the increased solvent coordination and increased availability of lithium ion concentration in the electrolyte. Further development of this electrolyte may enable practical applications for lithium metal anode in rechargeable batteries. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nZheng et al.  8  used interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres to stabilize Li surface with a CE of B99% for 4150 cycles. However, no electrolytes have been reported to date that simultaneously overcome all of the challenges-dendritic metal deposition, low CE during Li deposition/stripping processes and poor rate performance-of Li metal electrodes. Most of the approaches reported to date mainly worked at relatively low current densities (o1 mA cm \u00c0 2 ), which are insufficient to meet the requirements for many practical applications (43 mA cm \u00c0 2 )  2, 8, 10, 11  . Therefore, new electrolytes that can lead to the high rate and stable cycling of the Li metal anode are urgently needed for the further development of rechargeable Li metal batteries. Here we demonstrate that the use of highly concentrated electrolytes composed of ether solvents and the salt lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI or LiN(SO 2 F) 2 )  30  results in the dendrite-free plating of Li metal at high rates and with high CE.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe use of additives (for example, vinylene carbonate (VC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and so on) and/or replacement of the LiPF 6 electrolyte salt with other salts-such as LiAsF 6 , LiBF 4 , LiClO 4 , LiCF 3 SO 3 or LiTFSI (that is, LiN(SO 2 CF 3 ) 2 )-does not ameliorate this poor performance to any significant extent  12  . The search for other solvents for this application has also been problematic. Electrolytes based on ether solvents generally result in a less-dendritic Li morphology and improved CE for Li plating/stripping owing to their lower reactivity with Li metal  10  , but these features are not retained on prolonged cycling  5  .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSeveral years earlier, it was reported by Henderson (one of the coauthors in this work), as well as other researchers, that highly concentrated liquid electrolytes prepared with glyme solvents and lithium salts have both a relatively high ionic conductivity and high oxidative stability  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  . More recently, a number of publications have shown the striking differences between the properties and cell performances for dilute and highly concentrated electrolytes with glyme solvents, as well as other aprotic solvents  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  . One study, in particular, found that highly concentrated LiTFSI-1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/DME electrolytes inhibited Li metal dendritic growth, but the Li plating/stripping CE was reported to be rather low (B71%)  24  . Lu et al.  11  reported that stable Li depositions can be obtained in the liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charging and discharging.

Multi-geochemical proxies, including different iron speciation and relevant ratios (FeHR/FeT, FeP/FeHR and FeT/Al ratios) and molybdenum concentrations, were used to reconstruct the paleo-depositional environment of this black shale horizon. The ratios of different iron species (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR < 0.80) suggest an overall anoxic conditions (ferruginous) over the deposition of the black shales, although intermittent euxinic (FeHR/FeT > 0.38 and FeP/FeHR \u2248 0.80) and oxic (FeHR/FeT < 0.38) intervals could have occurred. Furthermore, FeT/Al ratios (FeT/Al \u2264 0.51) confirm that water column may not be persistent euxinia during the deposition of the Datangpo black shales. Meanwhile, molybdenum concentrations show a decreasing trend towards the top of the black shales, reconciling the gradual oxygenating trend during this period as stated above. Compared to \u03b434SPy values in the Mesoproterozoic deep ocean, more positive \u03b434SPy values of this study may result from a small size of sulfate reservoir. The small-size sulfate reservoir and concurrent enrichment of molybdenum indicate that the ocean chemistry in the Cryogenian Period is similar to that in the Archean Eon. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nA southeast-facing (present orientation) passive continental margin on the Yangtze Block was subsequently developed in the course of breakup of the Rodinia Supercontinent (Fig.  1A ). Thermal subsidence related to the post-rift extension of South China Block created significant accommodation space in which thick Middle-to-Late Neoproterozoic successions were deposited  (Jiang et al., 2003; Wang and Li, 2003) . Neoproterozoic stratigraphic successions in South China comprise well exposed, relatively unaltered glacial and interglacial deposits (Fig.  1B ). The Cryogenian Group unconformably overlies the slate rocks of the Banxi Group. Two main Cryogenian diamictite successions, the lower Jiangkou Group and the upper Nantuo Formation, have been recognized in South China. The interglacial Datangpo Formation of manganese-bearing shales, \u223c 10 m thick on the upper slope to \u223c 200 m thick on the lower slope  (Wang and Li, 2003) , sits on the glacial deposits of the Jiangkou Group.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nThe Neoproterozoic Era (1000-542 Ma) was an important interval subjected to dramatic climatic changes and biological evolutions in Earth's history. The Snowball Earth hypothesis suggested that the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets during the Neoproterozoic glaciation epoches  (Hoffman et al., 1998) . In the aftermath of glaciations, several lines of evidence, including iron chemistry and sulfur isotopic data from China, Canada, Oman and Australia, indicate stepwise oxygenation of the postglacial Ediacaran ocean (635-542 Ma), stimulating the evolution of early animal life  (Canfield et al., 2007; Fike et al., 2006; Komiya et al., 2008; Maruyama and Santosh, 2008; McFadden et al., 2008) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe Datangpo Formation includes the lower thinner black shales (\u223c30 m thick), the focus of this study, and the upper thicker grey shales (\u223c 200 m thick) (Fig.  1B ). A pair U-Pb zircon ages of 663 \u00b1 4 Ma  (Zhou et al., 2004)  and 654.5 \u00b1 3.8 Ma  (Zhang et al., 2008)  for the tuffaceous beds in the basal and topmost Datangpo Formation provides a constraint for the timing of this interglacial interval.\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we choose the Mingle section, where the interglacial Datangpo Formation comprises the lower 30 m-thick black shales and the upper 180 m-thick grey shales (Fig.  1 ). 16 samples, each at approximately 2 m apart, were collected in the lower 30 m-thick black shales for geochemical analysis. For each sample, ca. 5 g of fresh shale was grinded to powder (200 mesh in size) in an automated agate mill.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Yet, half of all the resulting publications appeared since 2000. The history of research before 1998 is described in five stages defined by publication spikes; subsequent work is not covered because historical perspective is lacking. In stage 1 (1871\u20131907), \u2018Cambrian\u2019 (now Neoproterozoic) glaciation was recognized successively in Scotland, Australia, India, Norway, Svalbard and China. Criteria for recognition included faceted and striated pebbles in matrix-supported conglomerates resting on ice-worn bedrock pavements. In stage 2 (1908\u20131940), Neoproterozoic glaciation was shown to have been widespread in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Major textbooks summarized these findings, but the rejection of continental drift (to account for late Palaeozoic glacial dynamics) put a chill on research. In stage 3 (1942\u20131964), the occurrence of glacial deposits within carbonate successions, as well as nascent palaeomagnetic observations, suggested that Neoproterozoic glaciers reached sea-level at low palaeolatitudes, but the belated recognition of sediment gravity flowage caused glacial interpretations to be prematurely abandoned in key areas. In stage 4 (1965\u20131981), the extent of Neoproterozoic glaciation was rethought in light of plate tectonics. Distinctive chemical sediments (iron\u00b1manganese formations and cap carbonates) were identified. In basic climate models, modest lowering of solar luminosity resulted in global glaciation due to ice-albedo feedback, and deglaciation due to greenhouse forcing resulted from silicate-weathering feedback in the carbon cycle. Neoproterozoic glacial geologists were blind to these ideas. In stage 5 (1982\u20131997), reliable palaeomagnetic data combined with glacial marine sedimentation models confirmed that Neoproterozoic ice sheets reached sea level close to the palaeoequator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe first Neoproterozoic glacial deposits were found in the SW of Scotland in 1871 and the rate of their discovery on 23 palaeocontinents and microcontinents was essentially linear until 1992 (Fig. \n2 .1). However, half of all the papers (n \u00bc 811) written on them before the end of 2008 were published in the previous 10 years (Fig.  2 .2). This surge in activity is the justification for the present volume, but this history ends at 1997. We lack historical perspective on the last decade and the endpoint eliminates the need to weigh any of the author's own contributions on this topic. This chapter begins by placing the recognition of the Port Askaig boulder beds of Scotland as glaciogenic in its historical context, coming in 1871 on the heels of the discoveries of late Palaeozoic glacial deposits in India, Australia and South Africa. Their inspiration was the Pleistocene glacial controversy of 1837-1865, which spawned both the orbital and 'greenhouse' theories of bidirectional climate change, and established the principal criteria for the recognition of past glaciation.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThese findings were highlighted in a Symposium on Palaeozoic and Pre-Cambrian Climates at the 17th IGC  (1937)  in Moscow. Major textbooks made note of these developments (Ko \u00a8ppen  & Wegener 1924; Brooks 1922 Brooks , 1926;; Coleman 1926 ). In the third period  (1942 -1964) , nascent evidence from palaeomagnetism and from the occurrence of glacial deposits atop thick carbonate-dominated successions in the North Atlantic region and within such successions in central and southern Africa implied that Neoproterozoic ice sheets had reached sea level in low palaeolatitudes. This inference met resistance and, after the discovery of turbidity currents as a cause of graded bedding  (1950) , some diamictites were reinterpreted as mass-flow deposits of non-glacial origin. These issues were discussed at major conferences on Palaeoclimates in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,  England (1963), and Ko \u00a8ln, Germany (1964) . The radiation of macrofauna following soon after the 'infra-Cambrian' ice age was often remarked upon.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt ended with overviews of Late Palaeozoic and Lower Cambrian ('possibly Pre-Cambrian') glaciations by Edgeworth  David (1907a, b)  at the 10th IGC, and the winning-over of a skeptical Geological Society in London by a fellow Australian  (Howchin 1908) . Faceted and striated clasts in diamictites were the decisive criteria for glaciogenesis, with a striated subglacial pavement beautifully exposed beneath 'Reusch's Moraine' (Fig.  2 .3) in Finnmark, Norway, for good measure. The second period  saw Neoproterozoic glacial deposits recognized in southern, central and western Africa, central and northern Asia, eastern and western North America and eastern South America (Fig.  2 .1, Table  2 .1). It was evident that glaciation 'at or just before the beginning of the Cambrian' had been more extreme than in the Pleistocene, possibly equal to the composite Late Palaeozoic glaciations of Gondwanaland.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

As suggested previously, a turbulent flow is driven by geothermal heating at the seafloor, which is balanced by a similar heat loss through the ice sheet above. It is argued that the expected horizontal inhomogeneities in these heat fluxes are sufficient to generate baroclinic instability, which drives geostrophic turbulence. Turbulent eddies then transport heat upward and poleward along isolines of constant density, thereby maintaining a statically stable stratification, contrary to previous findings from numerical models that do not adequately resolve the geostrophic turbulence. The kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is expected to be controlled by a balance between the potential energy input by the diabatic forcing and frictional dissipation in the bottom boundary layer. The resulting characteristic flow speed is estimated to be on the order of 1 cm s\u22121, which is in agreement with previous numerical simulations. Eddy diffusivities are estimated to be on the order of 100 m2 s\u22121, which is smaller than in the present-day ocean but probably within one order of magnitude. Because of the weak forcing, the resulting gradients of temperature and salinity would be much smaller than in the present-day ocean, with global-scale potential temperature variations on the order of 0.1 K, again in agreement with previous numerical simulations. The presented theoretical arguments may also be relevant to other planetary bodies with an ice-covered ocean. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nGeological evidence suggests that for multiple time periods during Earth's history the oceans were entirely, or almost entirely, covered by sea glaciers  (Kirschvink 1992; Hoffman et al. 1998; Hoffman and Li 2009; Hoffman and Schrag 2002; Pierrehumbert et al. 2011 ). These periods are commonly referred to as ''snowball Earth'' events. While many studies have simulated the atmospheric and climate dynamics of snowball Earth events (e.g.,  Wetherald and Manabe 1975; Pierrehumbert 2005; Abbot and Pierrehumbert 2010; Voigt and Marotzke 2010; Voigt et al. 2012; Abbot et al. 2013; Rose 2015) , the ocean dynamics have received relatively little attention. A number of studies have presented coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations of snowball states (e.g.,  Poulsen et al. 2001; Marotzke and Botzet 2007; Voigt and Marotzke 2010; Voigt et al. 2011; Ferreira et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2011; Ferreira et al. 2011; Rose 2015) . However, the ocean model setup and parameters in these simulations are based on the present-day ocean; yet, basic physical considerations make clear that the ocean circulation in a snowball world would be very different from the present day. In particular, the source of mechanical energy for the present-day ocean circulation is provided primarily by surface stress from the winds blowing over the ocean  (Wunsch and Ferrari 2004; Ferrari and Wunsch 2009) . During a snowball event, however, the ocean is shielded from atmospheric wind stress by a solid ice sheet, and the circulation is likely driven primarily by geothermal heating at the seafloor (typically ignored in the aforementioned studies). Because heat is supplied at higher temperatures and pressures near the seafloor, and lost at lower temperatures and pressures at the bottom of the ice sheet, mechanical energy can be extracted via the principle of a heat engine.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, the rate of mechanical energy extraction is expected to be much smaller than the power provided to the large-scale circulation in the present-day ocean by wind stress, which provides a crucial constraint on the strength of the ocean circulation and mixing rates (e.g.,  Ferrari and Wunsch 2009) . A more focused analysis of snowball Earth ocean circulation was recently spearheaded in a series of papers by  Ashkenazy et al. (2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  and  Ashkenazy and Tziperman (2016) , who use a hierarchy of models to study the ocean circulation under a thick ice sheet. In  Ashkenazy et al. (2013)  and  Ashkenazy et al. (2014) , global two-and three-dimensional ocean models are coupled to a dynamic sea glacier model. The simulations of  Ashkenazy et al. (2013 Ashkenazy et al. ( , 2014) )  indicate interesting dynamics mostly in the equatorial region, where a vigorous overturning circulation with associated zonal jets develops within a few degrees of the equator.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Graphene has been recently explored as a two-dimensional nanoscale material, and has demonstrated simple device functions based on conventional top-down fabrication. However, the synthetic approach to encoding electronic functionality and thus enabling an entire integrated graphene electronics in a chemical synthesis had not previously been demonstrated. Here we report an unconventional approach for the synthesis of monolithically-integrated electronic devices based on graphene and graphite. Spatial patterning of heterogeneous catalyst metals permits the selective growth of graphene and graphite, with controlled number of graphene layers. Graphene transistor arrays with graphitic electrodes and interconnects were formed from synthesis. These functional, all-carbon structures were transferrable onto a variety of substrates. The integrated transistor arrays were used to demonstrate real-time, multiplexed chemical sensing, and more significantly, multiple carbon layers of the graphene-graphite device components were vertically assembled to form a three-dimensional flexible structure which served as a top-gate transistor array. These results represent a substantial progress towards encoding electronic functionality via chemical synthesis and suggest future promise for one-step integration of graphene-graphite based electronics. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nNo characteristic peak of the metals was detected, which indicated that metal catalysts were completely removed by the etching process. Electrical properties of graphene and graphite can be modulated by controlling the number of graphene layers (n). First, we show that conductivity or sheet resistance can be controlled by more than an order of magnitude, dependent on n. Films of graphene and graphite with differing n were synthesized using different metal catalyst films as previously described (also see Methods and Supplementary Information). Fig.  2a  shows the sheet resistance values of graphene and graphite measured using a four-point probe, as a function of n. The sheet resistance was reduced about 25 times (from 2,463\u00b11,037 \u03a9/sq down to 98\u00b146 \u03a9/sq), as n increased from ~2-4 to ~850 layers. The local variation of n influences the deviation of the sheet resistance. We also characterized the field-effect response of both 2-4 layer graphene and ~850 layer graphite (Supplementary Fig.  S5 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nS5 ). Current versus backgate characteristics showed much stronger modulation in 2-4 layer graphene, compared to negligible change in the thick graphite (~850 layers) due to stronger screening effect as the number of layers increases  26  . The low sheet resistance and field-effect response of graphite are advantageous for applications in conductive films or electrodes, in contrast to superior transconductance level of the 2-4 layer graphene which is appropriate for active channels of field-effect transistors (FETs). The capability to modulate electronic properties through synthetic control of the graphite thickness provides a route to rationally designing and synthesizing large-scale electronics based entirely on carbon. The metal catalyst, Cu/Ni (700 nm/5 nm), was used to synthesize 2-4 layer graphene channels and the same combination with an additional Co (400 nm) was used to produce graphite electrodes which serve as the source (S) and drain (D) (Fig.  2b ). This method enabled the fabrication of all-carbon based transistor arrays which were then transferred onto a 285 nm-thick SiO 2 on Si wafer for measurement of backgate response.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition to contact properties of graphite electrode to graphene channel, advantages of the graphite, compared to metals, lie in its superb mechanical flexibility. We observed that even when graphite electrodes were distorted up to strain of ~2 %, I-V characteristics remained the same (Fig.  2f ). The synthetic method facilitated the creation of a large-scale field-effect sensor arrays composed of monolithic graphene-graphite, which were transferred onto 285-nm SiO 2 / Si wafer. One block of the array contained nine of 2-4 layer graphene field-effect sensors with graphite single common source and independent drains. The sensor chip had four of these blocks composed of 36 sensor devices total, as illustrated in Fig.  3a . The graphite electrode parts were covered with a 2 \u03bcm-thick SU8 passivation layer with openings around the 2-4 layer graphene channels. The current change measured while sweeping Ag/AgCl water-gate voltage at different pH solution is presented in Fig.  3b . The charge neutrality point shifted positively with increasing pH, and the pH sensitivity was ~17 mV/pH.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In this article, we map the allosteric network in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A using NMR spectroscopy. We show that positive allosteric cooperativity is generated by nucleotide and substrate binding during the transitions through the major conformational states: apo, intermediate, and closed. The allosteric network is disrupted by a single site mutation (Y204A), which also decouples the cooperativity of ligand binding. Because protein kinase A is the prototype for the entire kinome, these findings may serve as a paradigm for describing long-range coupling in other protein kinases. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs expected for AMP-PNP binding, a cluster of residues within the small lobe of the enzyme is highly sensitive to the addition of nucleotide. The most pronounced changes (\u232c\u2426 \u03fe 0.05 ppm) are observed in residues of the \u24243-strand and the highly conserved glycine-rich loop (\u24241-and \u24242-strands), which actively participate in positioning the nucleotide. Crystal structures have shown that the \u24243-strand flanks the nucleotide-binding site and contains K72, which coordinates the \u2423and \u2424-phosphates of ATP  (13, 14) . Gradual decreases of \u232c\u2426 toward the C-and N-terminal regions from the glycine-rich loop suggest that nucleotide binding affects distal sites within the small lobe of the enzyme. This is evident by the large \u232c\u2426 values for residues that in the crystal structure are \u03fe35 \u00c5 away from helices A and B (Fig.  3 ). A second region is centered at A188 and at the surface of the large lobe where substrate docking would take place (Figs.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nReverse Order of Ligand Binding. The titrations were repeated by inverting the order of ligand additions, adding Kemptide first (i.e., intermediate-S) and then saturating the enzyme with AMP-PNP to form the Michaelis complex [the histograms with residue vs. \u232c\u2426 number are provided in supporting information (SI) Fig.  5 ]. Unlike AMP-PNP addition to the apo-enzyme, saturation with Kemptide caused relatively modest changes to the enzyme fingerprint. Only the phosphorylated S10 located in the A helix shows a drastic chemical-shift change. However, smaller changes are detected throughout the entire enzyme's backbone, which indicates that Kemptide binding radiates its effects to both lobes. Subsequent addition of AMP-PNP to the Kemptide-bound enzyme caused changes in three regions that are similar to the direct titration: around the glycine-rich loop, between the catalytic and peptide-positioning loops, and the unstructured C-terminal portion of the enzyme (SI Fig.  5 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe low on-rates support the hypothesis of a rather complex binding mechanism for the nucleotide, which requires conformational changes in the small lobe  (18) . These changes within segments of the small lobe are thought to be responsible for binding, aligning, and positioning the nucleotide for the formation of a catalytically competent complex. In addition to this, changes in both lobes occur to properly position the substrate and shield the active site from bulk water  (26) .\n\nDiscussion\nNMR spectroscopy is becoming the method of choice to analyze allostery  (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) , cooperativity  (27, 32, (36) (37) (38) , energy landscapes  (11, 32, (36) (37) (38) , and coordination of reactions for small and large enzymes  (11, 38, 40) .

As a consequence, we are willing to use huge amounts of energy to produce it. Solid-state lighting (SSL) is an emerging technology that promises performance features and efficiencies well beyond those of traditional artificial lighting, accompanied by potentially massive shifts in (a) the consumption of light, (b) the human productivity and energy use associated with that consumption and (c) the semiconductor chip area inventory and turnover required to support that consumption. In this paper, we provide estimates of the baseline magnitudes of these shifts using simple extrapolations of past behaviour into the future. For past behaviour, we use recent studies of historical and contemporary consumption patterns analysed within a simple energy-economics framework (a Cobb\u2013Douglas production function and profit maximization). For extrapolations into the future, we use recent reviews of believed-achievable long-term performance targets for SSL. We also discuss ways in which the actual magnitudes could differ from the baseline magnitudes of these shifts. These include: changes in human societal demand for light; possible demand for features beyond lumens; and guidelines and regulations aimed at economizing on consumption of light and associated energy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this section we discuss these three possibilities in turn.\n\nSaturation in demand for raw lumens\nAs has been discussed, at current levels of per-capita consumption of light, there is no evidence that we have reached a saturation in the demand for light. It is nevertheless an open question whether we will approach such a saturation in the future or whether per-capita consumption of light will continue to scale linearly with gdp/CoL. To understand this question more quantitatively, we decompose per-capita consumption of light into the product of three factors: I N , the average illuminance foot_11  (or light per unit area, in units of lm m -2 ) that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours; \u03c4 on /(\u03c4 on + \u03c4 off ), a dimensionless illumination duty factor that accounts for how many hours per year the area around a person is actually illuminated and a N /(1 + a N \u03c1 N ), the average unshared illuminated area (in units of m 2 ) that a person is surrounded by  24  . In other words, \u03d5 = I N \u2022 \u03c4 on \u03c4 on + \u03c4 off \u2022 a N 1 + a N \u03c1 N .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMoreover, even if the enclosed indoor areas in which we work and live might ultimately saturate, the unenclosed outdoor areas which we either occupy for short periods during the day or evening, or which are visible from enclosed indoor areas, may be less prone to saturation. Such unenclosed outdoor areas (e.g. streets, parks and other recreation and public spaces) could all be rendered more useful if better illuminated in the evening hours (albeit at the cost of reducing the contrast of the night sky due to light pollution (Boyce 2003)). And there is a natural human tendency to gaze out (we value windows, not just because they are a portal for incoming light, but because of the view they afford (Boyce 2003)) into faraway spaces, even if we do not directly occupy those spaces. We conclude that it is possible that the average unshared illuminated area is nearing a saturation point, but plausible arguments can be made that the saturation point may yet be a factor 10\u00d7 or greater away.\n\nDemand for features beyond lumens\nAlthough the primary demand for light is to illuminate our environment, there are many other features of light that are important to the consumer.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nHowever, reasonable arguments can also be made that as a human society we are not near a saturation in consumption of light. As discussed in section 5.1, the average illuminance that a person is surrounded by during his or her waking hours and the average unshared illuminated area that a person is surrounded by may each yet be 10\u00d7 or more from saturation. As discussed in section 5.2, new performance attributes associated with SSL have the potential to unleash new and unforeseen ways of consuming light. As discussed in section 5.3, guidelines and regulations may also have limited influence on light consumption.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

It has 22 spectral bands including the day/night band (DNB), which is a panchromatic reflective solar band (RSB) covering a wavelength range of 500\u2013900 nm. Similar to other RSBs, the radiometric calibration of the DNB is in reference to the sunlight reflected from an onboard solar diffuser (SD). As an independent validation to the SD measurement, lunar calibration has been regularly scheduled at nearly constant lunar phase. In this paper, the lunar calibration strategies developed for RSB are extended to DNB. The on-orbit gain coefficient, or the so-called F factor, is derived for DNB low-gain stage (LGS) from lunar data for each lunar calibration event. Its on-orbit change is compared with the change of the LGS SD F factor. For more accurate comparison, the impact of the on-orbit relative spectral responses (RSR) change, caused by the wavelength-dependent degradation of the optical throughput of VIIRS telescope mirrors, must be considered. This impact is more significant for DNB than other RSBs because of its wider bandwidth, and the impact to the SD and lunar calibrations are different due to different scene spectra. Simulation results show a gradually increased deviation of 1% between SD and lunar trends since launch till now and 0.3% deviation since 2 April 2012 lunar calibration, when the lunar F factor was firstly calculated, till now. Taking this effect into account, the on-orbit changes of the SD F factor and lunar F factor agree with each other in less than 0.3%. Our results validate the stability of the DNB SD calibration while demonstrating how the on-orbit RSR change should be considered in the radiometric calibration and data usage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBecause the spectra of the SD calibration and lunar calibration are different, the on-orbit change of the DNB RSR is expected to introduce deviation between the detector gain changes tracked by SD calibration and lunar calibration. In this paper, the deviation is estimated and verified by the measurement.    [Mills, 2010] . Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\nDNB LGS Calibration and Calibration Methodology\nThe DNB gain stages are automatically selected for EV images depending on the radiance level of each pixel. The gain stage information is recorded on a pixel level. For a given pixel, which can be operated at any of the three gain stages, the equation that yields DNB top-of-atmosphere radiance is L DNB \u00bc F LGS;LUT \u00c1 P 2 i\u00bc0 c i;LUT \u00c1dn i DNB RVS DNB;LUT ; (1) where the LGS F factor F LGS,LUT , the background DN offset,LUT , and the adjustment coefficients c i,LUT are regularly updated as look-up tables (LUT). Here dn DNB is background-subtracted detector response DN DNB \u00c0 DN offset,LUT .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe calibration of the DNB LGS uses the solar diffuser (SD) view, and the procedure is similar to the one used for the other RSBs  [Lei et al., 2015a; Lei et al., 2015b] . As has been demonstrated for other RSBs as well, the Moon can be used as a source to independently perform the calibration and track the stability of the SD calibration  [Xiong et al., 2015] . In our study, the RSB lunar calibration algorithm is extended to DNB with the DNB LGS F factor calculated from the lunar images captured during VIIRS scheduled lunar calibrations. The VIIRS design incorporates a rotating telescope assembly (RTA) that can protect the main optical elements from on-orbit contamination  [Weiss, 2011] . Due to tungsten contamination on the coating of the RTA mirrors, the S-NPP VIIRS has experienced strong wavelength-dependent throughput degradation since launch  [Barrie et al., 2012] . In addition to causing the decrease of the signal level and then SNR, the relative spectral response function (RSR) of VIIRS bands is altered by the degradation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe change of the detector gain coefficient F factor can be tracked through lunar calibration, and the results are consistent with the SD calibration within \u00b10.5% for all calibration events since 2 April 2012 when the first lunar DNB F factor can be calculated. Unlike other narrow-band RSBs, the analysis shows that the change of the modulated RSR has much more significant impact to the calibration of the DNB. Also, the impact to the lunar calibration and solar calibration are different due to different source spectra. Taking into account this effect, the difference between the SD and lunar calibration is about 0.3% since 2 April 2012, in terms of the long-term deviation. The seasonal variation observed in lunar calibration result has been attributed to the ROLO lunar irradiance model instead of VIIRS measurement, as is demonstrated by the lunar calibration results of other RSBs as well.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Many examples of bio-inspired hard materials can be found in the literature; far less attention has been devoted to soft systems. Here we introduce deterministic routes to low-modulus thin film materials with stress/strain responses that can be tailored precisely to match the non-linear properties of biological tissues, with application opportunities that range from soft biomedical devices to constructs for tissue engineering. The approach combines a low-modulus matrix with an open, stretchable network as a structural reinforcement that can yield classes of composites with a wide range of desired mechanical responses, including anisotropic, spatially heterogeneous, hierarchical and self-similar designs. Demonstrative application examples in thin, skin-mounted electrophysiological sensors with mechanics precisely matched to the human epidermis and in soft, hydrogel-based vehicles for triggered drug release suggest their broad potential uses in biomedical devices. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThese ideas are fully compatible with existing chemistries and materials approaches in tissue engineering, in the sense that embedded lattice structures can provide the necessary mechanical response without altering the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the matrix, as shown for the example in Fig. 1 (ref. 42). Substrates for bio-integrated electronics. These types of bioinspired soft composites represent ideal platforms for stretchable electronic systems that intimately integrate with the human body  [43] [44] [45] [46] [47]  . Figure  6a-c  and Supplementary Fig.  14  shows an example that consist of a thin (2 mm), filamentary metal mesh that rests on a layer of silicone (B60 mm) with an embedded network structure (described in Methods section) designed to match the mechanical properties of the epidermis. The result is a skin-mounted sensor for electrocardiography (ECG) that has sufficiently small thickness and low modulus (at low strain) to maintain conformal contact with the skin, but with skin-like physical toughness (Fig.  6b ) to allow multiple cycles of application and removal without damage to the device or the skin (Fig.  6c ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAlthough such soft, non-mineralized biological structures offer great potential in areas ranging from artificial tissue constructs to bio-integrated devices, they have received far less attention compared with their mineralized counterparts  25, 26  . Here we introduce a type of bio-inspired, soft deterministic composite that can quantitatively reproduce the mechanics of non-mineralized biological materials, including the precise nonlinear stress/strain response of human skin and its subtle spatial variations across different locations on the body. The concepts use planar, lithographically defined networks related to those found in lightweight, impact resistant, loading bearing structures  [27] [28] [29]  with serpentine microstructures originally developed for interconnects in stretchable electronics. A low-modulus elastomer or hydrogel provides a supporting matrix  30, 31  . When formed with network geometries optimized using tools of computational mechanics, such composites can yield a wide range of desired mechanical properties, including isotropic and anisotropic responses and spatially heterogeneous characteristics. Successful experimental demonstrations of these soft network composites in combination with electrophysiological sensors and drug-release vehicles indicate their potential for practical applications in biomedical devices.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMany sophisticated examples of synthetic materials that exploit these design concepts can be found in the literature  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  . The second involves tangled networks of coiled fiberous polymers, typically in a ground substance that includes interstitial fluid, cell adhesion proteins and proteoglycans  18  . Tensile loads cause these fibres to unfurl, straighten, buckle, twist and stretch in a manner that imparts a low-modulus response for relative small strains (for example, ligament: B0-2%, epidermis: less than B10%) with a sharp transition to a high modulus regime for larger strains (for example, ligament: B5%, epidermis: B30%)  [19] [20] [21] [22]  . This 'J-shaped' stress-strain response combines soft, compliant mechanics and large levels of stretchability, with a natural 'strain-limiting' mechanism that protects biological tissues from excessive strain  23, 24  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst (45 wt%, Vulcan, Tanaka) and Pt black (fuel cell grade, Sigma), the synthesized Pt nanowires exhibit superior performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with a specific activity of 0.368 mA/cm2, which was 2.7 and 1.8 times greater than that of Pt/C (0.138 mA/cm2) and Pt black (0.202 mA/cm2), respectively. The mass activity of Pt nanowires (0.088 mA/\u03bcg) is 2.3 times that of Pt black (0.038 mA/\u03bcg) and comparable to that of Pt/C (0.085 mA/\u03bcg). \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nCarbon-supported multiarmed star-like platinum nanowires made in aqueous solution displayed high activity and durability  [9] . A similar enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity was observed for Pd nanorods prepared by electrodeposition  [10] . Other 1D platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts including PtFe nanowires  [11] , Pd-Pt dendrites  [12] , and Pd-Pt core-shell nanowires  [13]  also showed outstanding performance. However, the synthesis of high quality ultrathin (sub 5 nm) Pt nanowires with high aspect ratio and uniform diameter is still challenging  [14, 15] . Here we report the synthesis of Pt nanowires assisted by [Cr(CO) 6 ] and a study of their electrocatalytic properties in ORR. Such Pt nanowires can be readily tuned to nanocubes by decreasing the concentration of [Cr(CO) 6 ].\n\nExperimental\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe mass activity of Pt nanowires (0.088 mA/\u00b5g) is 2.3 times that of Pt black (0.038 mA/\u00b5g) and comparable to that of Pt/C (0.085 mA/\u00b5g). Such enhancement can be ascribed to the surface contraction associated with the ultrathin diameter  [8] . Improved stability of the Pt nanowires can be expected because no additional carbon support is required. \n\nConclusions\nWe have successfully synthesized Pt ultrathin nanowires with a uniform diameter of 2-3 nm and high aspect ratio by symmetric growth from dumbbell nuclei. [Cr(CO) 6 ] plays a pivotal role in the formation of these dumbbell nuclei. These nanowires exhibit superior catalytic properties compared with Pt nanocubes and commercial catalysts. Considering that [Cr(CO) 6 ] acts as both reducing and shape directing agents, we believe that this method opens the door to synthesize Pt-based alloy ultrathin nanowires with controllable composition.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe freshly prepared [Cr(CO) 6 ] solution at 100 \u00b0C was then injected into the [Pt(acac) 2 ] solution. The color of the solution changed from light yellow, to brown, and then to black. The reaction was carried out at 120 \u00b0C for 30 min. The temperature was subsequently increased to 160 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min for another 30 min. Then the solution was cooled down to room temperature by removing the heating mantle and adding 40 mL of ethanol. The Pt nanowires were separated by centrifugation and decantation. Finally the product was redispersed in chloroform. Similar products were obtained when the temperature was directly raised to 160 \u00b0C after the injection of the [Cr(CO) 6 ] precursor instead of the two step procedure.\n\nPreparation of working electrodes\nFor the commercial Pt/C catalyst (45 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72 carbon support, Tanaka), an aqueous dispersion (1 mg/mL) was prepared and sonicated for 60 min.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This is the very first time both large electrochemical strains and fast response rates were achieved in the conducting polymer actuators. The large and fast electrochemical deformation resulted from the fact that the PPy film doped with large TFSI anions swelled in PC such that TFSI can insert and expel the PPy film easily, and that a high ionic conductivity in H2O/PC solution enabled to move TFSI quickly. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe peak response rate was much larger than that (ca. 0.1% s -1 ) of other conventional PPy actuators  [2] , and that (3.2% s -1 ) of a PF 6 --doped PPy by using resistance compensation techniques  [14] . Ding et al.  [15]  prepared a tubular PF 6 --doped PPy with a Pt helical wire, exhibiting up to 13% s -1 strain rate and 5% strain, and we reported a PPy film with a compliant Au electrode at one side, prepared from an MB solution of TBACF 3 SO 3 , showed a peak strain rate of 8.8% s -1 and the maximum strain of 12.1%  [16] . Additional metal electrodes such as the Pt helical wire and the compliant Au thin layer decreased the voltage drop along the PPy actuators, giving fast response rates.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nConducting polymers (CPs) such as PPy are promising soft actuator materials potentially applicable to artificial muscle devices because of their large electrochemical stresses  (3) (4) (5)    [1] [2] [3] [4] , 10 times as large as that (0.35 MPa)  [5]  of mammalian skeletal muscles. The applications of CP linear actuators have been, however, quite limited due to their moderate electrochemical strains (1-3%)  [1, 2, 6] . Recently, some PPy actuators with more than 10% electrochemical strains appeared  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , and some of which achieved up to 40% strain  [11, 12] , almost same level as that of skeletal muscles. Such extremely large electrochemical strains were measured when potential was swept at very slow scan rates of 2 or 0.2 mV s -1 . Obviously, most applications of CP actuators require much faster response rates, so CP actuators with large strains and fast response rates are highly expected.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe PPy film was cut into a 10 mm \u00d7 2 mm strip and set in a one-compartment three-electrode cell described elsewhere  [8]  to measure change in length of the PPy strip by using a laser displacement meter (KEYENCE LE-4000) at typically 0.1 MPa load (under isotonic conditions) on applying potential. The definition of electrochemical strain of PPy actuators was change in length of the strip divided by the original length ( l/l 0 ). When the maximum strain was measured, potential was swept between -0.9 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + by using a potentio-galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research 263A) at 2 mV s -1 in H 2 O/PC solutions of LiTFSI. Electrochemical contraction and expansion were conducted by applying a constant potential of -0.7 and +0.7 V versus Ag/Ag + , respectively, for 100 s except the second expansion (30 s) at room temperature.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This paper reports the discovery of ultralow thermal conductivity (\u223c0.4 W\u22c5m\u22121\u22c5K\u22121) in single-crystalline, all-inorganic halide perovskite nanowires, which is comparable to their amorphous limit value. We attribute ultralow thermal conductivity to a cluster rattling mechanism, based on strong phonon\u2013phonon scattering via the coexistence of collective motions involving various atom groups. These results call attention to the vital thermal transport processes and thermal management strategies for applications with all-inorganic halide perovskites. Further, CsSnI3 shows a rare combination of ultralow thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, so it can be a promising material for unique applications as an electrically conductive thermal insulator. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nBoth of these halide perovskites have been investigated for potential applications in solution-processed optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics  (12, 13) , light-emitting diodes  (14, 15) , and lasers  (16, 17) . However, fundamental study of thermal transport in halide perovskites has been significantly lacking despite its practical and fundamental importance. For HHP, very few experimental studies have been performed for thermal conductivity  (18, 19)  and an ultralow thermal conductivity value of 0.5 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 has been reported for single-crystalline CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Computational study revealed that the main reason for the ultralow thermal conductivity of HHP is rotational motions of organic CH 3 NH 3 + ions  (20) (21) (22) . For instance, Hata et al.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor instance, Hata et al. computationally demonstrated the critical role of CH 3 NH 3 + rotations by comparing results with A-site cations possessing different degrees of freedom, where the elimination of the rotational degree of freedom results in greater thermal conductivity by a factor of \u223c2  (20) . While limited investigations of thermal transport in HHP have been reported and some aspects of thermal transport in HHP are understood, fundamental understanding of thermal transport in AIHP remains largely elusive. The thermal transport mechanism in AIHP is expected to be fundamentally different from that in HHP, since vibrational density of states in organic and inorganic ions are largely mismatched for HHP, and monoatomic Cs + in AIHP does not contain rotational modes in contrast to the CH 3 NH 3 + ion in HHP  (20, 21) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFurther, the ratio of k lattice to k min of AIHP NWs at room temperature is only \u223c2 for all cases (Fig.  2D, Inset ). This ratio is lower than that of other crystals exhibiting low thermal conductivity (SI Appendix, Table  S1 ), particularly for CsPbBr 3 and CsSnI 3 . We also note that AIHP NWs have far smaller thermal conductivity compared with traditional inorganic oxide perovskites whose values are 2-10 W\u2022m -1 \u2022K -1 (30). To elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the observed ultralow thermal conductivity, we apply a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) (details in SI Appendix)  (31) . Considering the intrinsic uncertainty associated with perturbation theory and DFT-based simulations, the calculated k lattice values without fitting parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values at high temperature (Fig.  2 A-C ). At low temperature, an empirical model is adopted to describe defect and boundary scatterings, and the computed data qualitatively agree with the trend observed in experimental data (Fig.  2 A-C ).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Using the cavity method of statistical physics and its relationship to belief propagation, we unveil a phase transition from a regime where we can infer the correct group assignments of the nodes to one where these groups are undetectable. Our approach yields an optimal inference algorithm for detecting modules, including both assortative and disassortative functional modules, assessing their significance, and learning the parameters of the underlying block model. Our algorithm is scalable and applicable to real-world networks, as long as they are well described by the block model. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn many networks, ranging from online communities to food webs, metabolic networks, and genetic regulatory networks, there are communities or modules that play distinct functional roles. A fundamental problem is to detect these communities and understand what role they play in the network's structure and dynamics. In social networks, these communities are often assortative, meaning that there is a higher density of connections within communities than between them, and many approaches to detecting these communities have been proposed (see e.g. \n[1] ). In other networks, however, these modules may consist of nodes with few connections to each other, but which connect to the rest of the network in similar ways. In this Letter we analyze a random generative model for sparse modular networks, known as the stochastic block model. It provides a useful playground for theoretical ideas and the analysis of algorithms, and is a popular model for functional modules in real networks. Using the cavity method developed in the physics of disordered systems  [2, 3]  we exactly analyze the detectability of these modules in the limit of large sparse networks. As a function of the parameters, we compute the phase diagram and locate the associated phase transitions.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe results obtained with MC, which can be easily equilibrated for such a small network, are almost identical to those of BP in terms of the parameters and marginals, and identical in terms of the estimated group assignments. This demonstrates that BP is a useful approach even on real, finite networks that are far from trees. Conclusion. We have presented a principled and asymptotically exact analysis of the detection of communities in networks generated by the stochastic block model. There is a strict limit on detectability due to a transition from a phase where the free energy landscape lets us infer the model's parameters, to a phase where it does not. In some cases the communities are detectable, but the problem is hard because the attractive region around the correct fixed point is exponentially small. Our analysis comes with an associated learning algorithm, which for large sparse networks generated from the model is able to learn the number of groups, their exact sizes, and the affinity matrix p ab . Our approach and our algorithm are easily generalized to other local generative models, and we will investigate its performance on a variety of real-world networks in the future.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis situation is typical of mean-field first-order phase transitions. In fact, recent results about random optimization problems show that finding the lower-free-energy phase in this case is an extremely hard problem  [11, 18] . Only when the paramagnetic phase is no longer locally stable does inference become easy. We can compute the location of the transition to this easily-detectable phase analytically by analyzing how a small random perturbation to the paramagnetic fixed point propagates as the BP equations are iterated  [11, 19] . It follows that for |c in -c out | > q \u221a c , (5) the original group assignment is dynamically attractive and hence many algorithms, e.g. MC or BP, will converge to it. Note that it is typically still hard to compute the ground state of (  2 ), even though we can compute the marginals, and therefore the optimal estimate of the group assignment, asymptotically exactly. On the other hand, if  (5)  is not satisfied then community detection is either impossible, or at best as hard as solving the hardest known optimization problems.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Potential relationships are typically explored by modeling the network as a function of the nodal attributes or by modeling the attributes as a function of the network. These methods require specification of the exact nature of the association between the network and attributes, reduce the network data to a small number of summary statistics, and are unable provide predictions simultaneously for missing attribute and network information. Existing methods that model the attributes and network jointly also assume the data are fully observed. In this article we introduce a unified approach to analysis that addresses these shortcomings. We use a previously developed latent variable model to obtain a low dimensional representation of the network in terms of node-specific network factors. We introduce a novel testing procedure to determine if dependencies exist between the network factors and attributes as a surrogate for a test of dependence between the network and attributes. We also present a joint model for the network relations and attributes, for use if the hypothesis of independence is rejected, that can capture a variety of dependence patterns and be used to make inference and predictions for missing observations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nA common goal in the analysis of network data is to characterize the dependence between network relations and a set of node-specific attributes. For example in recent years many studies in the social sciences have examined the relationship between individuals' friendship networks and their health measures, such as happiness, smoking and drinking behavior, and obesity (e.g.  Veenstra et al. (2013)  and references therein). Similarly in the biological sciences, scientists are interested in the relationship between how proteins interact and their biological importance (see  Butland et al. (2005)  for example). In each of these applications, parameter vector. The covariate vector x i,j typically includes terms for each attribute of the sender node i and receiver node j, as well as interaction terms measuring the similarity between the sender and receiver attributes. These interaction terms are frequently specified as the absolute difference between the attributes, an indicator of whether an attribute is the same for both the sender and receiver node (in the case of discrete attributes), or the product of the nodes' attributes.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe improvement was greatest for male drinking frequency and female GPA where prediction mean squared error was reduced by about 15%. This illustrates that when dependence exists between the network and attributes, improvements in the predictions of missing values can be obtained by using both the network and attribute information.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this article we introduced an original approach to testing whether dependencies exist between a network and attribute data, and a joint modeling framework for the network and attributes, which relies on a simplified representation of the network in terms of latent nodespecific factors. As discussed in the Introduction, many others have proposed methodology for investigating the relationship between network and attribute data. The most common methods involve regressing either the network on functions of the nodal attributes or each node's attributes on functions of the attributes of the node's neighbors in the network. Frequently final models are settled upon after some, often undocumented, model selection procedure which not only alters the interpretation of the results, but also adds an additional element of subjectively to the analysis. The key distinction between the previous methods and those presented here is that our method does not involve any model selection procedures and simultaneously tests and estimates first and second order dependencies between the network and attributes.\n\nExcerpt 3: \n(see  Cohen-Cole and Fletcher (2008)  and  Lyons (2011)  for additional discussion of these methods). Other similar models include the auto-regressive network effects models of  Erbring and Young (1979)  and  Marsden and Friedkin (1993)  and the p * social influence models of  Robins et al. (2001) . All of these models are univariate, focusing a single attribute of interest that is possibly subject to social influence. While modeling the network and attributes as functions of one another is able to provide some insight into their dependence structure, there are two primary drawbacks to utilizing these methods for analysis. First, neither modeling framework allows for simultaneous inference about the dependencies between and among the network relations and attributes. For example, when analyzing data on an adolescent friendship network and individuals' health behaviors there may be interest in whether smoking habits and obesity status are conditionally independent given the network. Addressing this question of dependence between attributes conditional on the network is impossible using either of the conditional modeling frameworks. A second limitation of these methods is that they are unable to accommodate, and provide predictions for, datasets that have both missing network and attribute information.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Though such a technology does not yet exist, the technical hurdles for fabricating minimally disruptive, solid-state electrical probes have arguably been overcome in the field of nanotechnology. Nanoscale devices can be patterned with features on the same length scale as biological components, and several groups have demonstrated that nanoscale electrical probes can measure the transmembrane potential of electrogenic cells. Developing these nascent technologies into robust intracellular recording tools will now require a better understanding of device-cell interactions, especially the membrane-inorganic interface. Here we review the state-of-the art in nanobioelectronics, emphasizing the characterization and design of stable interfaces between nanoscale devices and cells. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nDesigning over orders of magnitude\nEngineering the nanoscale interaction between cells and electrodes may be the fundamental challenge to massively parallel intracellular recordings, but a complete in vivo recording system presents additional technical obstacles. For instance, each recording site must transmit information out of the brain (>millimeters) to downstream electronics, which can become logistically challenging as the number and density of the electrodes increases. While up to 512 electrodes have been accommodated by flexible connectors  [19] , dramatically larger numbers of electrodes are probably to require multiplexing and/or wireless transmission. Electrode arrays of up to 26,400 electrodes have been achieved in vitro with multiplexing  [96] , but such a demonstration has yet to be achieved in vivo. Finally, electrode micromotions within the brain can disrupt the recording if the electrode moves relative to the cell  [97] . Ideally the recording site could move independently from the rest of the electronics, such as a wireless device on the brain surface  [98]  or a soft physical tether to the outside world  [19] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nActive mechanical stabilization has been used to correct the micromotion of rigid glass microelectrodes in vivo  [97] , but high density recordings will more probably rely on the compliance of flexible micro-wires or nanowires arrays  [99, 100]  to passively decouple recordings sites from recording electronics. Such a design will be particularly important for awake recordings, where animal movement requires special attention to electrode stabilization  [101] . Indeed, motivated by the difficulty of interfacing rigid structures with brain, there is much ongoing work adapting flexible electronic materials for use in neuroscience  [102, 103] . Flexibly tethered recordings present a different problem, however, as they cannot be delivered deep within the brain without the aid of a rigid shuttle  [102, 103]  or other means of providing reversible rigidity during insertion  [104, 105] .\n\nConclusion\nNanoscale devices show great promise for intracellular electrical recording and have indeed already been used Nanotechnology and neurophysiology Angle, Cui and Melosh 137 for specific applications such as electrophysiological phenotyping of IPSC-derived cardiac cells  [86] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWhole-cell patch recording  [15] , sharp microelectrode recording  [16, 17] , and silicon-based extracellular electrodes  [18, 19]  remain the state-of-the-art in neural recordings despite their well-known limitations: whole-cell patch recording causes dialysis over periods of minutes  [20] [21] [22] , sharp microelectrodes change input resistance and resting membrane potential  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , and extracellular recording cannot measure subthreshold changes in neuronal transmembrane potential  [28] . The motivation for developing nanoscale tools for neurophysiology is to record intracellular electrical activity from thousands of neurons simultaneously without perturbing their physiological properties. Furthermore, to make these tools impactful to neuroscience, they should be robust, easy to use, and their performance reproducible across labs. Several groups have now demonstrated that solid-state nanoscale devices can record electrical activity in neurons and cardiomyocytes, which signals an important step toward parallelizable, non-dialyzing intracellular recording.

However, most touch panels have been developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes. We demonstrate an ionic touch panel based on a polyacrylamide hydrogel containing lithium chloride salts. The panel is soft and stretchable, so it can sustain a large deformation. The panel can freely transmit light information because the hydrogel is transparent, with 98% transmittance for visible light. A surface-capacitive touch system was adopted to sense a touched position. The panel can be operated under more than 1000% areal strain without sacrificing its functionalities. Epidermal touch panel use on skin was demonstrated by writing words, playing a piano, and playing games. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn the stretched states, the currents also showed similar negative linear correlations with the interval of the electrode and the touch points. A 2D hydrogel panel was tested in order to detect the position of the touch point. As shown in Fig.  2, A  and C , a thin hydrogel film, rectangular in shape, was connected to the Pt electrodes at each corner. Four current meters were also installed between the voltage source and each corner. Two normalized distances, a and b, were used to indicate the position of the touch on the panel. The bottom left corner of the panel corresponded to (a, b) = (0, 0), and the top right corner corresponded to (a, b) = (1, 1). When the panel is touched by a finger, it can be virtually divided into four resistive sections by the touch point (Fig.  2B ). In the circuit, four virtual resistors are connected together in parallel, and this parallel circuit of resistors is connected to the capacitor by the finger in series. In Fig.  2C , the test positions of the touches are displayed.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs shown in Fig.  4D , we subsequently touched from TP#1 to TP#4 on the epidermal touch panel, and the current was measured with the A1 current meter. The correlation between the measured currents and the touched position was not influenced by the attachment. The epidermal touch panel could successfully perceive various motions, such as tapping, holding, dragging, and swiping. Thus, various applications can be easily managed by integrating the panel. As shown in Fig.  4 , E to G, writing words (Fig.  4E ), playing music (Fig.  4F ), and playing chess (Fig.  4G ) were accomplished via adequate motions on the epidermal touch panel (movies S3 to S6). We have demonstrated a highly stretchable and transparent ionic touch panel. We used a PAAm hydrogel containing 2 M LiCl salts as an ionic conductor. We investigated the mechanism of position-sensing in an ionic touch panel with a 1D strip. The ionic touch strip showed precise and fast touch-sensing, even in a highly stretched state.

We thoroughly investigated temperature-dependent polarization, dielectric, and impedance spectroscopies, and we found no evidence of ferroelectric effect in a MAPbI3 thin film at normal operating conditions. Therefore, the effect does not contribute to the hysteresis in PSCs, whereas the large component of ionic migration observed may play a critical role. Our temperature-based polarization and dielectric studies find that MAPbI3 exhibits different electrical behaviors below and above ca. 45 \u00b0C, suggesting a phase transition around this temperature. In particular, we report the activation energies of ionic migration for the two phases and temperature-dependent permittivity of MAPbI3. This study contributes to the understanding of the material properties and device performance of hybrid perovskites. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe temperature dependence of dielectric loss and conductivity (Fig.  S9 ) also suggests a phase transition between 40 o C-50 o C. Figure  4b  shows frequency spectra of dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and loss tangent. Unusually high values of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032 , similar to those in Refs.  37, 38  , can be seen at low frequencies (970 at 1 Hz and 30 o C), which dramatically decrease by more than one order at higher frequencies. Such a strong dependence of dielectric permittivity, particularly at low frequencies, is not a favorable sign of a ferroelectric nature of the material. At low frequencies, the value of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032 increases with temperature, whereas at high frequencies the trend is opposite but at a much smaller rate. This low-/high-frequency boundary is at ~10 3 Hz for our MAPbI3 thin film.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe dielectric loss \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2032\u2032 shows a 1/f behavior for frequencies below a few kHz, following the so-called Jonscher's law, which accurately reveals the ionic conductivity of the material.  39, 40  As temperature increases, a small and wide shoulder (indicated by the arrow in Fig.  4b ) begins to appear and shifts toward higher frequency with temperature. Such a behavior is typical for relaxation processes, found in the generic Debye expression of permitivity.  37  Considering the low frequency and broad peak feature, this relaxation process could be a Maxwell-Wagner type interfacial polarization relaxation, possibly attributed to grain boundary effects or blocking at the contacts. The dielectric loss tangent of the material was found to be high at lower frequencies, especially at lower temperature. The peak value of loss tangent shifts toward higher frequency as the temperature is increased (~1 Hz for 10 o C to ~200 Hz for 70 o C). Moreover, the loss tangent starts increasing with temperature at >100 Hz, and below this frequency the loss tangent decreases with increasing temperature. More work is expected to be done in the future to understand this phenomenon.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nObservation of the P-E loop change across the phase transition may also provide clues in determining whether a ferroelectric feature exists. Various measurements  20, 22, 23  have shown evidence of a MAPbI3 phase change in the broad temperature range of 42 o C~57 o C.  22  Correspondingly, the electrical and optoelectrical properties of perovskites, including the dielectric constant,  24  have been reported as having a clear temperature dependence.  [25] [26] [27]  However, the polarization response of MAPbI3 perovskite is still unknown in the typical PSC operating temperature range, and a temperature-based polarization study should provide useful information. Moreover, ferroelectric (and antiferroelectric) polar materials also show typical signatures in dielectric spectroscopy.  21  Particularly, when approaching the phase transition temperature TC from high-temperature paraelectric to low-temperature ferroelectric, the dielectric constant will strongly increase and then decrease again below TC. Therefore, the dielectric constant and loss tangent will exhibit a characteristic peak or jump in their temperature dependence.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

This study presents the large-scale features of the simulated climates and compares the new model results to those of the atmospheric models from the first phase of the PMIP, for which sea surface temperature was prescribed or computed using simple slab ocean formulations. We consider the large-scale features of the climate change, pointing out some of the major differences between the different sets of experiments. We show in particular that systematic differences between PMIP1 and PMIP2 simulations are due to the interactive ocean, such as the amplification of the African monsoon at the Mid-Holocene or the change in precipitation in mid-latitudes at the LGM. Also the PMIP2 simulations are in general in better agreement with data than PMIP1 simulations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n6 ). This strengthens the cross equatorial flow and favours the maintenance of the ITCZ to the north of its present day position in West Africa and the nearby ocean  (Kutzbach and Liu, 1997; Braconnot et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2005) . The expansion of the area influenced by the Afro-Asian summer monsoon during MH is one of the most striking features shown by palaeoenvironmental data (Fig.  10 ), and thus this region has become one of the major focus for model evaluation in PMIP  (McAvaney et al., 2001) . Figure  10  is an updated version of Fig.  3  of  Joussaume et al. (1999)  and shows that, compared to present day, at least 200 to 250 mm/yr ad-ditional precipitation is needed to sustain steppe in place of desert as far as 23 \u2022 N. All PMIP1 simulations produce increased precipitation to the north of the modern position of the ITCZ, but the magnitude is underestimated compared to data.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOver North India, similar conclusions can be drawn (Fig.  9d ). These results show that there is no specific differences between the different sets of simulations, suggesting that the change in precipitation is mostly due to the reduction in the mean water vapour associated to the large-scale cooling across the tropical regions, the reduction in evaporation, changes in the residence time of water in the atmosphere and to changes in water vapour advection  (Yanase and Abe-Ouchi, 2007) . \n\nAfrican and Indian monsoons at the Mid-Holocene\nThe change in MH precipitation over West Africa has been a key focus of PMIP1. Figure  9a  shows that the response of PMIP2 OA MH simulation in JJAS ranges from 0.2 mm/d to 1.6 mm/d (5 to 140%). Both OA and OAV simulations tend to produce larger precipitation changes in this region than PMIP1 SSTf experiments. This increase in precipitation is due to the response of the ocean and the building up of warmer conditions in the subtropics and mid latitudes in the Atlantic north of the equator and colder conditions in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig.  6 ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n5 ). Since the cooling is not as large as in PMIP1 there is more water vapour in the atmosphere and evaporation still occurs along the path of the storm track, which explains the signature in precipitation.\n\nMid-Holocene\nChanges are modest compared to those of the LGM, but reflect the sensitivity of the climate system to changes in the mean seasonal cycle of insolation. In particular, there is nearly no simulated change in annual mean temperature or precipitation for the Mid-Holocene, consistent with no change in global annual mean insolation. The major changes for this period compared to present correspond to an enhanced (reduced) seasonal cycle of temperature in the NH (SH). The continental warming favours the deepening of the JJAS thermal low over land, which intensifies the low level    winds and moisture transport from the tropical ocean to the continent, and thereby intensifies monsoon system in the tropical regions  (Kutzbach et al., 1993; Joussaume et al., 1999) . All models simulate an amplification of the mean seasonal cycle of NH surface temperature.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We demonstrate that in space-charge limited diodes the hole mobility (micro(h)) of a large variety of organic semiconductors shows a universal Arrhenius temperature dependence micro(h)(T) = micro(0)exp(-Delta/kT) at low fields, due to the presence of extrinsic carriers from the Ohmic contact. The transport in a range of organic semiconductors, with a variation in room temperature mobility of more than 6 orders of magnitude, is characterized by a universal mobility micro(0) of 30-40 cm(2)/V s. As a result, we can predict the full temperature dependence of their charge transport properties with only the mobility at one temperature known. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRecently, also the dependence of h on the carrier density in a PPV derivative has been investigated by a combined study on polymeric diodes and field-effect transistors  [8] . It has been demonstrated that the hole mobility is constant for charge carrier densities typically <10 22 m \u00ff3 and increases with a power law with density for carrier densities >10 22 m \u00ff3 . In contrast to the earlier assumption  [4]  the enhancement of the mobility at higher voltages in SCL diodes at room temperature has been shown to be totally due to the increase of the carrier density instead of the electric field  [9] . However, at lower temperatures the field dependence of the mobility becomes increasingly more important. Therefore, a transport model has been developed that incorporates both the effect of carrier density and electric field on the mobility  [10] . The occurrence of two regimes in the density dependence of the mobility is governed by the amount of charge carriers in FIG.  1 . (a) The hopping in a Gaussian DOS is schematically represented for low carrier densities.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHowever, with increasing density [Fig.  1(b) ] E f will pass E eq at a given density, and then E f serves as a new starting point for the hopping transport. With increasing density E f moves closer to E t , leading to an enhanced mobility for larger densities. The relative positions of E f and E eq are crucial to explain the temperature dependence of the charge transport  [11, 12] . Upon cooling down, E eq moves deeper into the tail of the Gaussian DOS, leading to a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence given by ln / 1=T 2 in case of low densities  [5] . For sufficiently high densities [Fig.  1(b)] , meaning E f > E eq , it has been demonstrated by Coehoorn that also within the Gaussian disorder model the transport is governed by an Arrhenius-like ln / 1=T behavior  [12] , as often observed in organic transistors  [13, 14] . Experimentally, the question whether the transport in organic semiconductors is better described by a ln / 1=T 2 or ln / 1=T [Eq.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs expected, the materials with a higher mobility also show weaker temperature dependence due to the reduced disorder. In Fig.  3 (b) the Arrhenius plot is extrapolated to T ! 1. Remarkably, again all measured mobilities originate from nearly one point, again 0 30 10 cm 2 =V s. The occurrence of a single value for 0 for such a large variety of organic semiconductors is surprising since its value is expected to be governed by the amount of electronic overlap between the chain segments. This result would indicate that the packing and resulting wave function overlap would be very similar for the materials studied here. However, it should be noted that the measured mobilities for the conjugated polymers are an average between both intrachain and interchain hopping processes. For intrachain hopping the hopping distance and localization length are about equal, leading to a T ! 1 mobility in a Gaussian DOS of  [22]  0 ea 2 ph  (3)  with a the hopping distance and ph the attempt-to-escape frequency.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems there appears a gapless phase between the QSH and insulator phases in 3D which is in contrast with the 2D case. Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless points (diabolical points) in 3D, but not in 2D. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe present one example. In  [7] , we constructed a fourband tight-binding model for HgTe. It is a zero-gap system, but by opening a gap with uniaxial pressure, it becomes a band insulator. The question here is whether it is a simple insulator or a topological insulator (i.e. QSH). In fact, from the parities of the bands below the Fermi energy E F from the four-band model in  [7] , the Z 2 topological number \u03bd turns out to be even. This disagrees with the result in  [18] . The reason for the disagreement is the following. This model only has four bands near the Fermi energy E F , and the other bands well below E F are discarded. In HgTe, one doubly-degenerate band just below the Fermi energy has a trivial Z 2 topological number, while the other discarded bands deep below the Fermi energy have a nontrivial Z 2 topological number; this leads to the seemingly contradicting results.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nA crossing of two such energy bands has co-dimension three; namely, by tuning three parameters one can make two bands degenerate  [20, 21] . To see this, let us consider a 2 \u00d7 2 Hamiltonian matrix H = a c c * b , (8) where a, b are real functions of k and m, and c is a complex function of k and m. A necessary condition for the two eigenvalues to be identical consists of three conditions a = b, Re c = 0 and Im c = 0, i.e. the co-dimension is three  [20] . These three conditions determine a curve in the 4D space (m, k x , k y and k z ). Thus for generic m there will be in general a point (or points) k where the eigenvalues are degenerate. When m is changed continuously the k point moves in the k space, and the system remains gapless. It will be revealed later how the system can open a gap and run into either the QSH or the insulating phases. On the other hand, for k = G/2, band crossing cannot occur in general.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAt the phase transition, the Z 2 topological number must change, which necessitates the closing of the gap at some wavevector k. There are various kinds of band crossing when we introduce a number of parameters; nevertheless, to study the phase transition, we restrict ourselves to 'generic' band crossing, and exclude band crossing achieved only by tuning more than one parameter. To be specific, we consider a Hamiltonian matrix H (k) = h \u2191\u2191 (k) h \u2191\u2193 (k) h \u2193\u2191 (k) h \u2193\u2193 (k) , (6) where k = (k x , k y , k z ). We assume that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian has no extra degeneracies other than those imposed by symmetry. We also assume that the Fermi energy E F lies within a gap of the Hamiltonian. The T-symmetry implies, H (k) = \u03c3 y H T (-k)\u03c3 y , (7) i.e. h \u2191\u2191 (k) = h T \u2193\u2193 (-k), h \u2191\u2193 (k) = -h T \u2191\u2193 (-k) and h \u2193\u2191 (k) = -h T \u2193\u2191 (-k).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We identify signatures of this Weyl point in the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states, observable in thermodynamic properties. Tunneling between the electron and hole pockets in a magnetic field is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p-n junction in real space. This magnetic breakdown happens at a characteristic field strength that vanishes when the Fermi level approaches the Weyl point. The topological distinction between connected and disconnected pairs of type-II Weyl cones can be distinguished by the qualitatively different dependence of the quantum oscillations on the direction of the magnetic field. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1 ). Here we investigate how this process, a momentum space manifestation of Klein tunneling  [22] , affects the magnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states (de Haas-van Alphen effect), providing a unique thermodynamic signature of the topologically protected band structure (an alternative to proposed transport signatures  [9, [23] [24] [25] ). Because the quantum oscillations are governed by extremal cross sections of the Fermi surface, one might wonder whether some symmetry is required to align the extremal cross section with the Weyl point, so that it becomes observable. Our analysis shows that a magnetic field axis for this alignment exists generically, because of the M\u00f6bius strip topology of the projective plane. We first consider Klein tunneling through a single type-II Weyl point, and then turn to pairs of Weyl cones of opposite helicity, which can be combined in topologically distinct ways  [8] -with a qualitatively different dependence on the Klein tunneling probability.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe intersection of L \u00fe and L -(encircled) is the special axis at which Klein tunneling between electron and hole pockets produces magnetic quantum oscillations with the difference frequency jF \u00fe -F -j, suppressing both the electron and hole frequencies F AE .

However, so far there have not been reports of use of this system for efficient correction of a genetic disease. Here we show that mice with a dominant mutation in Crygc gene that causes cataracts could be rescued by coinjection into zygotes of Cas9 mRNA and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the mutant allele. Correction occurred via homology-directed repair (HDR) based on an exogenously supplied oligonucleotide or the endogenous WT allele, with only rare evidence of off-target modifications. The resulting mice were fertile and able to transmit the corrected allele to their progeny. Thus, our study provides proof of principle for use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct genetic disease. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn summary, we have demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to cure a genetic disease in mouse by directly correcting the genetic defect through NHEJ-or HDRmediated gene editing. In the future, it would be of interest to investigate whether similar gene-correction strategies could be used for mutation correction in a setting related to human diseases, such as human stem cells.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nTaken together, our data suggest that while supplying exogenous oligos may not be necessary, the exogenous oligonucleotide could serve as an optional template for repairing the mutant gene, especially when the endogenous allele cannot be used as the template (as in homozygous genetic diseases). In this study, 24 mice were cured of cataracts using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. To further confirm the correction of the disease, we performed histological analysis of lenses prepared from repaired and control cataract mice. As shown in Figure  1I  and Figure  S2H , control cataract mice showed pathological changes in the equatorial region of their entire eyes, but the cataract-free mice that were cured via HDR or NHEJ-mediated gene editing (two or three mice, respectively) exhibited normal histological features. One major hindrance to the therapeutic application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is the potential for offtarget mutations; we therefore examined off-target effects in the repaired mice.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nImpressively, by directly injecting Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into zygotes, mice or rats carrying mutations in transgenes or multiple endogenous genes can be generated in one step  (Li et al., 2013a (Li et al., , 2013b;; Shen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013) , indicating that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used as an effective tool for genome engineering  (Gaj et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, successful correction of disease-causing mutations in animal models via the CRISPR-Cas9 system has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we report the efficient correction of a mutant gene in a mouse disease model by zygote injection of CRISPR-Cas9, and we report subsequent successful transmission of the corrected trait to the next generation. We chose a mouse model of dominant cataract disorder caused by a defined mutation in the Crygc gene  (Zhao et al., 2010) . These mice carry a 1 bp deletion in exon 3 of Crygc.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Because of the high structural and chemical variability of polymers that can be created by synthetic approaches, thin films composed of polymers are especially useful in creating a wide range of stimuli-responsive structures. Moreover, since polymer thin films can be patterned by a number of planar techniques such as photolithography, molding, or imprinting, a variety of precisely patterned 2D precursors can be used to fold-up functional structures such as tubular, spherical and polyhedral capsules, biomimetic actuators and even microsurgical tools. This article reviews recent advances and highlights future challenges. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe ability to create stimuli-responsive metamaterials offers the possibility for the realization of adaptive optical and electromagnetic coatings. Kim et al. have shown that differentially cross-linked NIPAM bistrips with lateral swelling heterogeneities show interesting thermally responsive shape transformations (Figure  4B )  [52, 53] , which could potentially be utilized to create novel stimuli-responsive structures. Spatial heterogeneities can also be achieved by doping NIPAM with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which were used to realize thermal stimuli responsive NIPAM/LDPE bilayer folding (Figure  4C ) and offer the possibility for optically responsive folding owing to the strong absorption of the CNTs in the near infrared  [54] . It is noteworthy that optically responsive polymeric bending and folding can also be achieved by the inclusion of photoactive molecules such as azobenzene  [55]  or photo-induced stress relaxation  [56] .\n\nPolymer triggers atop strained non-polymeric bilayers\nAs evident from our previous discussion, it is relatively straightforward to create polymeric and hydrogel actuators that respond to temperature, pH, electric and optical signals.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nStimuli responsive materials are expected to play an important role in the creation of multi-functional, smart, reconfigurable, mechanized, and biomimetic structures at a variety of length scales  [1 ] . Self-folding broadly refers to a class of self-assembly systems in which structures curve or fold-up either spontaneously or in response to a stimulus. In the perfect sense of the term, self-folding materials are composed of multiple interconnected units that fold up without any active human control. Selffolding of biomolecules such as proteins is an essential feature of the internal machinery of a cell and a variety of supramolecular and origami inspired strategies have been developed to create synthetic stimuli responsive selffolding molecular structures ranging from self-folding cavitands  [2, 3]  to foldamers  [4, 5]  to DNA boxes  [6] . Folding in these systems is typically mediated by relatively weak interactions such as hydrogen bonds which can be broken or formed.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIt is noteworthy that self-folding methods work at these size scales and 100 nm scaled metallic self-folding polyhedra have already been achieved,  [65]  but similarly sized stimuli responsive polymeric self-folding structures have yet to be demonstrated. Additional developments in the micro and nanopatterning of thin polymer films such as using direct-write  [66]  or imprint  [67]  techniques could enable these advances. It is noteworthy that surface forces have also been applied to curve and self-fold polymeric thin films  [68 ,69 ]  and so called capillary origami has been demonstrated and can even be controlled using electric fields  [70] . However, the capillarity driven reversible self-folding of micro and nanostructures in response to chemical stimuli would require the manipulation of capillary forces such as with surfactants, and this could prove challenging. It is important to note that chemical engineers have an important role to play in the design and implementation of such stimuli-responsive self-folding materials. The diffusion and reaction rates of chemical stimuli interacting with the polymer chains within these thin films determine the time scale of actuation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Numerous studies have detected significant changes in the observed occurrence of extreme heat events, irrespective of how such events are defined. Further, a number of these studies have attributed present-day changes in the risk of individual heat events and the documented global-scale increase in such events to anthropogenic-driven warming. Advances in process-based studies of heat events have focused on the proximate land-atmosphere interactions through soil moisture anomalies, and changes in occurrence of the underlying atmospheric circulation associated with heat events in the midlatitudes. While evidence for a number of hypotheses remains limited, climate change nevertheless points to tail risks of possible changes in heat extremes that could exceed estimates generated from model outputs of mean temperature. We also explore risks associated with compound extreme events and nonlinear impacts associated with extreme heat. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe two hypothetical mechanisms are (1) increased amplification of standing and short wavelength Rossby waves (called \"quasi-resonant\" circulation regimes) and (  2 ) weakening of fast-moving Rossby waves and associated storms. Note that the two mechanisms are active areas of research, and as such their theoretical basis in either the observed or future climate is not established. However, the two hypotheses would be consistent with nonlinear increases in extreme heat events. Furthermore, the hypotheses complement one another as both account for reduced summer weather variability at synoptic time scales, and there is some evidence that both are occurring in boreal summer  [21] .\n\n\"Resonant\" Circulation Regimes\nPlanetary wave influence on midlatitude weather in all seasons is a topic of active research. In the boreal midlatitude summer, amplifying interactions among standing (quasistationary) Rossby waves and fast-moving (free) Rossby waves of similar wavenumber (e.g., 6-8) have been proposed as being critical in producing long-standing heatwaves and other extreme events  [17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 37, 44] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nHow well does persistence associated with the large-scale dynamical mechanisms explain heat wave evolution, relative to the predictions associated with existing, more localized, theories of heat wave evolution (e.g., Miralles et al.  [32] )? While only representing a single model and location, the analysis of Teng et al.  [54]  of projected heatwaves over the Great Plains is important because it partitioned both planetary wave and land surface factors, concluding that only the latter could explain projected increases in heat waves there. The question of causation of any changes in midlatitude dynamics is even more challenging. Changes in the summer midlatitudes and Arctic may share a common mechanism, perhaps in the tropics (e.g., Ding et al.  [55] ). Petoukhov et al.  [17]  and Hoskins and Woolings  [40]     [17] , based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis that subtleties in the subtropical jet-which a priori are more driven by the tropics than the Arctic-are critical to quasiresonance.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBeyond an incipient theoretical basis for quasi-resonance and its link to heat extremes, some observational evidence for it exists  [21] ; however, the evidence remains mixed, and its detection is potentially sensitive to how quasi-resonance is measured  [43, 46] . Thus, considerable scientific work remains to establish anything more than an associative link to changes in heat extremes.\n\nWeakened Zonal Winds and Summer Storms\nIncreases in midlatitude extreme heat events have also been loosely attributed to weaker zonal flow  [21]  and reduced summer storms  [21, [23] [24] [25] . The proposed mechanism is that transient fast-moving waves slow and weaken in response to a weakened equator-to-pole temperature gradient from Arctic amplification  [21, [23] [24] [25] 47] , which reduces baroclinicity  [25, 43] . Coumou et al.  [23]  report that a combination of weaker waves with slower phase speeds has reduced eddy kinetic energy (EKE, a quantity of transient systems) by a striking two standard deviations, a departure climate models do not project under large radiative forcing until approximately 2100.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The interface quality is found to be strongly affected by the perovskite deposition procedure, and in particular from the environment where the conversion of the starting precursors into the final perovskite is performed (air, nitrogen, or vacuum). The conversion efficiency of the precursors into the hybrid perovskite layer is compared between the different solar cells by looking at the ToF-SIMS intensities of the characteristic molecular fragments from the perovskite and the precursor materials. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the STEM confirms the macroscopic ToF-SIMS findings and allows elemental mapping with nanometer resolution. Clear evidence for iodine diffusion has been observed and related to the fabrication procedure. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis would contribute to the lower PCE value of the one-step processed sample. The signal from PbCl -is found to be very low and fairly constant, indicating that the PbCl 2 precursor is almost absent. In sample A (Figure  7a ), the perovskite layer is very compact, The strong decrease in R A within the perovskite layer indicates that the perovskite formation is inhomogeneous with a more efficient conversion at the bottom part of the perovskite layer, while more Pb X I Y species are present at the interface with the HTM not bound into the perovskite structure. In sample B, R B is fairly stable within the perovskite layer, indicating an efficient and homogeneous perovskite conversion which well fits with the high PCE values. The raise of R B indicated some iodine diffusion toward the HTM. In sample C, similarly to sample B, R C displays a constant value in the perovskite layer.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis work has explored in detail the morphology, composition, and interfaces in PSCs deposited by different methodologies and external conditions by combining multiple advanced characterization tools.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n2.4. Perovskite Conversion Efficiency. Composition analysis with EDX, XPS, and ToF-SIMS have revealed iodine diffusion leading to an inhomogeneous lead/iodine ratio, with marked composition differences between in the capping perovskite layer and the one embedded into the mesoporous TiO 2 layer. It is then crucial to establish whether the constituent elements of the perovskite are present in the desired perovskite form (i.e., CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) or in other forms (PbI 3 or PbI 2 , etc.) as this would allow to compare the perovskite conversion efficiency associated with the each conversion method and environment and determine ionic diffusion testified by the presence of strong signals from iodine fragments.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTo do this, we selected from the ToF-SIMS profiles the most characteristic fragment from the crystallized perovskite (Pb 2 I 3 -, which is totally absent outside the perovskite layer) and a second fragment PbI 3 -which has the strongest intensity in the perovskite layer, but it is thought to be found also where iodine and lead are bound to form isolated PbI 3 (i.e., not converted into the perovskite structure). The profiles obtained in each sample together with the ratio between PbI 3 and the (smoothed) Pb 2 I 3 -signals (named R i ) are displayed in Figure  7 . In a homogeneous perovskite layer R i would be constant; an increase in R i is an indication of higher abundance of PbI 3 not in the perovskite form. In sample D (single step, Figure  7d ), PbI 3 signal displays a remarkable raise in the mesoporous TiO 2 matrix indicating a possible iodine diffusion into the TiO 2 scaffold not efficiently forming the perovskite structure (in agreement with STEM results).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Geochronological tests of this hypothesis have been limited by a dearth of reliable age constraints bracketing these events on multiple cratons. Here we present four new Re-Os geochronology age constraints on Sturtian (717\u2013660 Ma) and Marinoan (635 Ma termination) glacial deposits from three different paleocontinents. A 752.7 \u00b1 5.5 Ma age from the base of the Callison Lake Formation in Yukon, Canada, confirms nonglacial sedimentation on the western margin of Laurentia between ca. 753 and 717 Ma. Coupled with a new 727.3 \u00b1 4.9 Ma age directly below the glacigenic deposits of the Grand Conglomerate on the Congo craton (Africa), these data refute the notion of a global ca. 740 Ma Kaigas glaciation. A 659.0 \u00b1 4.5 Ma age directly above the Maikhan-Uul diamictite in Mongolia confirms previous constraints on a long duration for the 717\u2013660 Ma Sturtian glacial epoch and a relatively short nonglacial interlude. In addition, we provide the first direct radiometric age constraint for the termination of the Marinoan glaciation in Laurentia with an age of 632.3 \u00b1 5.9 Ma from the basal Sheepbed Formation of northwest Canada, which is identical, within uncertainty, to U-Pb zircon ages from China, Australia, and Namibia. Together, these data unite Re-Os and U-Pb geochronological constraints and provide a refined temporal framework for Cryogenian Earth history. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nINTRODUCTION\nAfter more than one billion years without robust evidence of glaciation, Cryogenian (ca. 850-635 Ma) strata record arguably the most extreme episodes of climate change in Earth's history. The widespread occurrence of lowlatitude glacial deposits on every paleocontinent, coupled with the unique geochemistry and sedimentology of cap carbonates  (Hoffman et al., 1998; Bao et al., 2008) , inspired the snowball Earth hypothesis  (Kirschvink, 1992) . However, the general paucity of radiometric age constraints from multiple paleocontinents for the onset and demise of Cryogenian glaciations (Sturtian ca. 717-660 Ma, and Marinoan ending ca. 635 Ma), as well as reports of putative pre-Sturtian glaciations  (Frimmel et al., 1996) , has fostered doubts about the synchronicity and global extent of these events (e.g.,  Allen and Etienne, 2008; Kendall et al., 2006) .\n\nExcerpt 2: \n635 Ma (Fig.  3 ). The long duration (>55 m.y.) of the Sturtian glacial epoch implies a relatively short Cryogenian nonglacial interlude (<25 m.y.), consistent with a repeated trigger for glaciation related to the tectonic background conditions that drive weathering and the consumption of CO 2 on 1-10 m.y. time scales  (Mills et al., 2011) . This updated Neoproterozoic chronology provides new constraints to test and refi ne climate models of a long-duration glacial epoch and the nature of a relatively short nonglacial interlude. The Os i data presented here confi rm enhanced weathering of juvenile crustal material prior to the onset of the Sturtian glacial epoch, consistent with a basalt weathering trigger for initiation of the Sturtian glacial epoch (e.g.,  Godd\u00e9ris et al., 2003; Rooney et al., 2014) . These ages confi rm the central prediction of the snowball Earth hypothesis of long-lived (~10 m.y.) glaciation with globally synchronous deglaciation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Sharad\n\nExcerpt 3: \nDISCUSSION\nThe existence of a pre-Sturtian, global Kaigas glaciation has been suggested from the apparent relationship between inferred glacial deposits and the following age constraints: a 741 \u00b1 6 Ma Pb-Pb zircon evaporation age in the Gariep belt of the Kalahari craton  (Frimmel et al., 1996) ; a 740 \u00b1 7 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age from near the base of the Bayisi diamictite on the Tarim craton  (Xu et al., 2009) ; and a 735 \u00b1 5 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP age from the Kundelungu Basin of the Congo craton  (Key et al., 2001) .

A total of 274 sequences were analyzed and assigned 48.00% Proteobacteria, 10.30% Actinobacteria, 9.90% Bacteroidetes, 6.60% Verrucomicrobia, 4.80% Acidobacteria, 1.80% Firmicutes, 1.50% Chloroflexi, 1.50% TM7, 1.10% Deinococcus-Thermus, 0.70% Planctomycetes, 0.70% Gemmatimonadetes and 0.40% Cyanobacteria. Economically important phyla Actinobacteria was second most dominant group after Proteobacteria, in our clone library. It would be interesting to hypothesize that root exudates from maize rhizosphere favors growth of Actinobacteria like microbes to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and decompose plant matter, for enhanced plant and soil health. An additional 12.8% of clone library (35 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) from 43 clones) with less than 94% similarity to any GenBank sequence could not be assigned to any known phylum and may represent unidentified bacterial lineages and suggests that a large amount of the rhizobacterial diversity remains to be characterized by culturing. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nPseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria. Cloned 16S rRNA genes affiliated with Pseudomonas were also infrequently recovered from rhizosphere soil samples  [30] . Pseudoxanthomonas has been known to use as bioremediation as reported earlier by Sanchez et al.  [31] . Most interestingly, the economically important phyla Actinobacteria was the second dominant group in our clone library, and among most dominant OTUs with 5 clone sequences was close relative of genera Streptomyces. This genera is of economical importance because of its antibiotic producing ability. Streptomyces, act as antagonists to many different phytopathogenic fungi, detection of chitinolytic activity of Actinomycetes also makes them promising candidates as biocontrol agents for diverse fungal diseases. Presence of phyla Actinobacteria in the rhizosphere opens the possibility of exploring them to identify members with antagonistic properties toward some economically hazardous plant pathogens.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe observation that sequences related to Proteobacteria phylum made up the largest fraction of clone library in this study is consistent with previous findings that the phylum Proteobacteria, which is metabolically versatile and genetically diverse, comprises the largest frac-  tion of the bacterial community in soil ecosystems, including the rhizosphere  [26] . The representation of genera Devosia is interesting as, previously these genera have been detected as a nitrogen fixing nodule former in Neptunia natans (L.f.) Druce  [27] , other dominant phylotypes were relatives of well known genera Rhizobium/ Mesorhizobium/ Rhodoplanes. 16S rRNA gene fragments related to Rhizobium was also recovered from maize roots and it was noted that pea was grown in the field site prior to maize cultivation  [28] . It is also possible that Rhizobium is a native member of non-legume rhizospheres  [29] . Pseudomonas is also recognized as a common rhizosphere colonizing bacteria.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe data derived maize rhizosphere in this study is particularly important since little 16S rRNA sequence information has been previously reported. In earlier studies using culture-based methodologies, members of Actinobacteria were shown to be the second most abundant bacterial group present on the roots and leaves of maize, after the Alphaproteobacteria  [22] . Molecular fingerprinting analysis of maize rhizobacteria confirmed that Actinobacteria formed dominant populations on maize roots in a tropical soil. It was also found that members of the Bacteroidetes group constituted dominant populations in the rhizosphere of maize and of canola  [23] . Members of this bacterial group are capable of degrading complex macromolecules, thus contributing to the turnover of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus  [24] . The analysis of a clone library of the maize rhizobacterial community indicated that Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria were dominant populations  [25] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Such approaches have been recently proposed and applied to improve plant and animal health [citation 64].\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Artificial ecosystem selection \nAbstract: Artificial selection has been practiced for centuries to shape the properties of individual organisms, providing Darwin with a powerful argument for his theory of natural selection. We show that the properties of whole ecosystems can also be shaped by artificial selection procedures. Ecosystems initiated in the laboratory vary phenotypically and a proportion of the variation is heritable, despite the fact that the ecosystems initially are composed of thousands of species and millions of individuals. Artificial ecosystem selection can be used for practical purposes, illustrates an important role for complex interactions in evolution, and challenges a widespread belief that selection is most effective at lower levels of the biological hierarchy. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nInoculation of microcosms, planting, and harvesting were carried out under sterile conditions so as to minimize contamination of the microcosms. Two sets of high and low lines were initiated in which the size of the soil inoculum differed by two orders of magnitude (6.0 g vs. 0.06 g). Each line consisted of 15 units and the 3 units with the highest (or lowest) value of the phenotypic trait were used as parents by combining the soil from the 3 units into a slurry that was used to inoculate the ''offspring'' generation of units. Fifteen microcosms per generation for the high and low treatments of the 6.0-g and 0.06-g inoculum sizes and two control treatments led to a total of 90 microcosms per generation for the complete experiment, which was continued for 16 35-day ecosystem generations. In generations 1 through 9, we ran sterile control treatments to serve as baselines that consisted of high and low selection lines inoculated with autoclaved 6.0-g slurries.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nNor were there any significant differences or trends when comparing sterilized, nonselected 6.0-g inocula and 0.06-g inocula in generations 11-15 (no control treatments were run in generation 16). In the aquatic experiment, the pH of the nonselected control line closely resembled that in the line selected for greater acidity, indicating that the divergence between the experimental lines largely was attributable to ecosystem selection for decreased acidity. Response to selection at the phenotypic level presumably requires an underlying change in ecosystem processes that cause the phenotypic traits in a proximate sense. We tested this proposition for the 6.0-g soil experiment by analyzing the soil of the control, high, and low lines at the time of harvest during generations 13 and 14. The discriminant function analysis (Fig.  3 ) clearly discriminates among the three lines on the basis of soil properties. Because the soil was identical at the beginning of each generation, these differences reflect a divergence in the biotic components of the ecosystems that change the soil chemistry over the course of a generation.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe most important soil variables that discriminate between the high and low lines include potassium, zinc, and phosphorous content, which plausibly affect plant biomass. Detailed understanding of the ecosystem processes that proximally cause the selected phenotypic traits will require additional research.\n\nDiscussion\nThe response to ecosystem-level selection in our experiments stands in contrast to theoretical models that have led many to reject higher-level selection as an important evolutionary force (3). However, the divergence of the high and low lines in our experiments also has an unstable quality, initially collapsing in all Evolution and Complex Systems. Both the response to selection and its unstable quality can probably be explained in terms of complex systems dynamics. Mathematical and computer simulation models of evolution tend to assume a simple relationship between phenotypic traits and their genetic basis, such as an altruistic behavior that is coded directly by an altruistic gene. In the case of our soil ecosystem experiment, we might imagine genes in soil organisms that have positive or negative effects on plant biomass, with variation among ecosystems caused by sampling error. Ecosystems initiated by small numbers of soil organisms may possess sufficient variation for ecosystem-level selection to operate, but not ecosystems initiated by large numbers of soil organisms.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Although the revolution in DNA sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic-level information, the biogeography of microbiomes is almost entirely uncharted at the micron scale. Using spectral imaging fluorescence in situ hybridization as guided by metagenomic sequence analysis, we have discovered a distinctive, multigenus consortium in the microbiome of supragingival dental plaque. The consortium consists of a radially arranged, nine-taxon structure organized around cells of filamentous corynebacteria. The consortium ranges in size from a few tens to a few hundreds of microns in radius and is spatially differentiated. Within the structure, individual taxa are localized at the micron scale in ways suggestive of their functional niche in the consortium. For example, anaerobic taxa tend to be in the interior, whereas facultative or obligate aerobes tend to be at the periphery of the consortium. Consumers and producers of certain metabolites, such as lactate, tend to be near each other. Based on our observations and the literature, we propose a model for plaque microbiome development and maintenance consistent with known metabolic, adherence, and environmental considerations.

The spatial structure of the consortium reveals unanticipated interactions and provides a framework for understanding the organization, metabolism, and systems biology of the microbiome and ultimately, its effect on the health of the human host.

Understanding Microbiomes: Genes Vs. Organisms. The imaging approach cuts through the overwhelming complexity of detail in microbial communities and allows common patterns to shine through. With deep sequencing, it has become clear that many taxa in the oral microbiota are shared across individuals but are abundant in some samples and almost vanishingly rare in others  (19, 38) . These differences in abundance may result from real differences between individuals, fluctuations within a single individual over time, or a combination of the two. Whatever its cause, the lack of a consistently abundant microbial \"core\" has led to the idea that perhaps it is not organisms but genes and functions that are conserved within the microbiome, distributed across a variety of organisms whose identities are irrelevant. The discovery of hedgehog consortia argues against this idea, at least for some microbiomes.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) ) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt CO2 -eq. yr(-1) at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2 -eq. yr(-1) ), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe 'yield growth' case assumes 9% higher yields than those forecast by  FAO (2006) , based on the 'Global Orchestration' scenario in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, (2005). The livestock 'feeding efficiency' gain case assumes improved livestock feeding efficiencies according to the 'intensive' livestock feeding efficiencies as described in  Erb et al., (2012a) ; under this assumption, input-output ratios of livestock are on average 17% better than in the reference case. The 'waste reduction' case assumes a reduction in the losses in the food supply chain by 6% (see section 2.2.), which was evaluated by assuming that demand reduction would linearly reduce all flows. As Table  2  shows, the combination of all measures results in a substantial reduction in cropland and grazing areas, even though the individual measures cannot be added up due to the interactions between the individual compartments shown in Fig.  1 , and regional disparities considered in the biomass-balance model  (Erb et al., 2012a,b) . In all cases, former agricultural land (i.e.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn all cases, former agricultural land (i.e. cropland plus grazing land area) would become available for nonfood purposes (afforestation or bioenergy crops) if stocking densities on grazing land were increased to higher, but still sustainable, levels; the latter were derived from spatially explicit data on the productivity of grazing areas (see  Erb et al., 2009 Erb et al., , 2012a,b;,b; Haberl et al., 2011) . Table  2  shows the GHG reductions that could be achieved in 2050 by using the spare land for afforestation, assuming a CO 2 sequestration of 11.8 t CO 2 eq ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (based on  Smith et al., 2000) .

Based on this model, we assess in a consistent way the areas freed or consumed by changing yields, diets and livestock efficiencies, which potentially can be used for bioenergy or carbon sequestration. The 'reference' case is similar to the projections of the FAO, (  2006 ) for 2050 in terms of changes in diets and cropland yields, as implemented in the TREND scenario in  Erb et al., (2012a) . The 'diet change' case assumes a switch to a low animal product diet ('fair and frugal' diet; see  Erb et al., 2012a)  and a contract and converge model of global food demand to the global average in the year 2000 (i.e. 2800 kcal cap \u00c01 d \u00c01 , compared to the global mean of 3100 kcal cap \u00c01 d \u00c01 in the reference case).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Geographic distribution of global agricultural lands in the year 2000 \nAbstract: Agricultural activities have dramatically altered our planet's land surface. To understand the extent and spatial distribution of these changes, we have developed a new global data set of croplands and pastures circa 2000 by combining agricultural inventory data and satellite-derived land cover data. The agricultural inventory data, with much greater spatial detail than previously available, is used to train a land cover classification data set obtained by merging two different satellite-derived products (Boston University's MODIS-derived land cover product and the GLC2000 data set). Our data are presented at 5 min (\u223c10 km) spatial resolution in longitude by longitude, have greater accuracy than previously available, and for the first time include statistical confidence intervals on the estimates. According to the data, there were 15.0 (90% confidence range of 12.2\u201317.1) million km2 of cropland (12% of the Earth's ice-free land surface) and 28.0 (90% confidence range of 23.6\u201330.0) million km2 of pasture (22%) in the year 2000. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[34] Our final predicted cropland extent of 15.0 million km 2 in year 2000 amounts to roughly 12% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), and pasture extent of 28.0 million km 2 amounts to 22% of global land area. Thus humans are using 34% of the global land area for their agricultural needs.\n\nGeographic Distribution of Croplands and Pastures in Year 2000\n[35] We analyzed the distribution of agricultural regions by 14 different regions of the world (Table  5 ). The greatest proportion of croplands in the world are found in South Asia, Europe, Southeast Asia, and United States, east of the Mississippi, while the greatest proportion of pastures are found in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, Pacific developed countries, China, Mexico and Central America, United States, west of the Mississippi, and tropical Africa. The smallest proportion of croplands are found in Canada, the Pacific developed Countries, and northern South America, while the smallest proportion of pastures are found in Southeast Asia, Canada, and United States, east of the Mississippi.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nWe have changed our philosophy here to trust the total area of agricultural land reported by the census data (unless they are outliers in the Step 1 calibration procedure), and use the satellite data sets for information on the spatial distribution within each census administrative unit. [43] The global area of pasture of 28.0 million km 2 is 18% lower than the standard FAOSTAT estimate of 34.4 million km 2 . The major differences are found in Saudi Arabia, Australia, China, and Mongolia. This is likely because the census data on pasture reported to FAOSTAT include grazed forestland and semiarid land. The definition of pasture has always been problematic, as acknowledged by FAOSTAT ( http://faostat.fao.org/site/375/default.aspx ), and one way to improve the situation in the future may be to develop global maps of livestock density [e.g.,  Kruska et al., 2003; W. Wint, Global Livestock Distributions, 2005, data   [44] Although we now have new global estimates of the distribution of cropland and pastures, several caveats need to be noted.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFirst, there is much misunderstanding and confusion regarding the definitions of croplands and pastures. In this study, we have followed the FAO definition, as described in section 2.2 (paragraph 2). For croplands, this includes temporary fallow lands (less than 5 years), which are not cultivated. It is not clear how strictly this restriction of less than 5 years was applied when accounting for fallow land. For example, the U.S. data on croplands used by FAOSTAT includes idled cropland, which includes land under the Conservation Reserve Program that amounts to roughly 9% of the total cropland area, and is often idled for longer than 5 years  [Lubowski et al., 2002] . Secondly, in tropical nations characterized by extensive fallow cropping systems, such a definition may include much land that is not currently cultivated, and therefore portray a misleading picture of what may be commonly thought of as cropland. Finally, these definitions of croplands say nothing about the productivity of the land, but this is the topic of our companion article  [Monfreda et al., 2007] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Still, there is evidence of an \u201cemerging supermarket revolution in India\u201d [citation 37], driven by domestic capital.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: Surprised by supermarkets: Diffusion of modern food retail in India \nAbstract: Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the patterns and dynamics of the diffusion of modern food retail in India.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper is based on detailed sales data from retail chains in India, short case studies of retail chains, and review of literature.\nFindings\nThe article presents three surprises concerning modern food retail diffusion in India. First, modern retail has developed in three \u201cwaves\u201d, with the first wave, government retail chains, starting in the 1960s/1970s, cooperative retail chains starting in the 1970s/1980s, and private retail chains in the 1990s/2000s. All three were substantial, and internationally uniquely, all three coexist in the 2000s as segments of modern retail. Second, the rise of modern private retail in India in the past six years has been among the fastest in the world, growing at 49 percent a year on average over that period, and bouncing back to growth after a dip from the recent recession. The great majority of modern private retail has arisen in 2007\u20102010. Third, beside the uniqueness of the coexistence of three types of retail noted above, Indian private retail chain development has unique or rare characteristics: driven by domestic capital investment, \u201cearly\u201d (in terms of usual international patterns) diversification into small formats, \u201cearly\u201d penetration of small cities and even rural towns, of the food markets of the poor and lower\u2010middle class, and of fresh produce retail. These unique factors have helped to propel it quickly.\nOriginality/value\nFor the first time in the literature, the paper presents an analysis of: the three waves in Indian retail; detailed sales data for all leading chains; and its uniqueness. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSeveral points are salient. First, as expected given that India has not liberalized multi-brand retail FDI, the rate of multinationalization is low and its impact in this second phase on Indian retail modest, and cash & carry, large, so far. In 2010, about 7 percent of total only-retail sales (like Latin America in the early 1990s) and 99 percent of major cash and carries (like Latin America now), i.e. in India 0.75 billion USD of sales was done by FDI firms (sole or joint venture), hence 15 percent of the total of modern-private retail and wholesale chain sales. Second, domestic modern-retail capital is from a mix of sources, according to the investing company's characteristics.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n4. Third surprise: private-retail revolution with unique Indian characteristics Various characteristics, especially of the second phase of the third wave -the private retail chain boom -are surprising, both to India, and about India compared with the past two decades of developing country modern retail diffusion. The essence of the differences is twofold. First, India has done what few other developing countries have done: started a supermarket revolution with domestic capital without relying at first on the push from retail FDI. Second, India has done what most other developing countries have done -but done them \"earlier\" (in the evolution of modern retail in the country), more simultaneously, more experimentally, more variously. We lay out the surprising differences below.\n\nPrimarily domestic investment\nIt is common for domestic (family company) capital to be important in the earliest stages of supermarket development in developing countries, but for the \"take-off\" some sector well-endowed with capital steps in and drives the investment. Sometimes that sector leads and then other sectors compete in investment and thus the aggregate investment grows.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMoreover, in the second half of the 2000s, there was demonstrably a public feeling (in the press and policy discussions) that multi-brand retail FDI liberalization was possible and perhaps imminent. This feeling arose partly from simply extrapolating from the ongoing trend of liberalization policies afoot: FDI liberalization was undertaken in logistics, wholesale, agribusiness, food service like fast food, and 146 JADEE 1,2 single-brand retail. We hypothesize that that belief pervaded the retail industry and was an inducement for domestic chains to invest vigorously. That could be to establish scale and thus competitive defences (as was done in Chile to the point of delaying FDI for some years), or appear to be a good partner for an MNC. To that inducement was added of course the intense competition among chains to jockey for position in the retail real estate market, to get first-mover advantages.

We then discuss the energetics, structural evolution, and variations in electronic and mechanical properties of crystalline and amorphous Li\u2013M alloys. Our calculations show that Li insertion is the least favorable in Si and the most favorable in Sn owing to its large effective interstitial space and softer matrix. Upon Li incorporation, the bonding strength of the host network is weakened, attributed to the transferred charge from Li. Li interstitials can migrate easily in all three host materials with a moderate migration barrier in Si and small barriers in Ge and Sn. Because of the cation repulsive interaction, Li atoms tend to remain isolated and well dispersed in M; also induced by this cationic nature is the charge redistribution toward Li, leading to the strong screening/shielding effect in Si, in which the excess charges are highly localized, and a relatively weaker effect in Sn. According to our mixing enthalpy calculations, alloying between Li and M is energetically favorable with Li\u2013Sn alloys being the most stable, followed by Li\u2013Ge and Li\u2013Si alloys. On the basis of structural, electronic, and mechanical property analyses, we also demonstrate how the incorporation of Li atoms with increasing concentration leads to the disintegration of host networks and softening of the Li\u2013M alloys, and associated with the more flexible lattices, the volume expansion at fully lithiated states are 434 (399)% (Si), 382 (353)% (Ge), and 305 (259)% (Sn) for amorphous (crystalline) Li\u2013M alloys. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nINTRODUCTION\nThe growing demands for safer lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with higher capacity and longer durability have led to the search for nextgeneration electrode materials. Although the most widely used graphite anodes in LIBs have good cycling performance with a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g \u00c01 (LiC 6 ), other group IV semiconductors (Si, Ge, Sn) can offer significantly higher capacities: 4200 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4.4 Si, 1600 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4. 4 Ge, and 990 mAh g \u00c01 for Li 4.4 Sn.  1, 2  In addition to the large increase in energystorage capacity, lithium\u00c0group IV alloys (Li\u00c0M, M = Si, Ge, Sn) also have a safe thermodynamic potential, making them attractive candidates for LIB anodes. However, the practical use of Si, Ge, or Sn as an anode material is hindered by its poor cycling ability.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus far, there has been no comprehensive comparison study on Si, Ge, and Sn as to the dynamic behavior of Li incorporation, the stability of the host lattices, and the properties of the alloys formed during lithiation. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C\n\nARTICLE\nIn this paper, we first examine the structure, stability, Li diffusion, Li\u00c0Li interaction, and how the host lattice M (M = Si, Ge, and Sn) is affected by Li insertion using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The group IV elements are found to adopt the diamond crystalline structure, which allows a comparative study on the nature of Li in different host materials, but the same diamond structure. Although other allotropic structures are found for Ge and Sn (\u03b2-Ge and \u03b2-Sn 18 ), they do not serve a particular interest in this study. We then examine the structure, energetics, and mechanical and electronic properties of Li\u00c0M alloys. The structural evolution in terms of Li content is analyzed for both crystalline and amorphous phases, and the relative stabilities of the alloys are evaluated based on their mixing enthalpies.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn particular, the large volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process (up to 400% for Si, 370% for Ge, and 300% for Sn)  3\u00c05  can cause cracking and pulverization of the electrodes. Considerable efforts have been made to overcome these problems through structural modifications  6\u00c011  and alloying with active/inactive elements.  12\u00c016  First-principles calculations have also been applied to investigate fundamental aspects of the lithiation behavior and structural evolution of the anode materials, yet many of which still remain unclear. Despite the similarities shared among the group IV materials, Si has received the most attention because of its highest known capacity, whereas the analogous systems have not been studied as closely, and some of their merits as an anode material may have been overlooked in the past. For instance, the diffusivity of Li in Ge is about 400 times greater than that of Li in Si at room temperature,  17  which may contribute to faster charge/discharge rates.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Using Fe@SiO2 nanoellipsoids as anisotropic building blocks, herein we demonstrate a new class of magnetically responsive photonic structures whose photonic properties can be dynamically tuned by controlling the direction of the magnetic fields they are exposed to. These novel photonic structures diffract at a minimum wavelength when the field direction is perpendicular to the incident angle, and a maximum wavelength when the field is switched to parallel direction; and the diffraction intensity reaches maximum values when the fields are either parallel or perpendicular to the incident light, and decreases when the field direction is moved off-angle. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[1]  Easily found in nature, such as opals,b ird feathers,a nd butterfly scales,s tructural color is brilliantly iridescent, metallic,a nd free from photobleaching unlike conventional pigments or dyes.Most colloidal assembly processes mimic the formation of opals and create close-packed structures from monodisperse colloidal spheres.H owever,l iving systems often involve non-closepacked ordered assemblies of anisotropic motifs,s uch as plates and rods,t hus display significantly more complex structural color responses including strong angular dependence and polarization effect.  [2]  Prior efforts have been made to organizing elongated particles,s uch as polystyrene and ZnS,  [3]  albeit the assembly methods are rather conventional and the resulting crystals do not exhibit different photonic responses to those from spherical particles. One of the important advantages of anisotropic particles is that they often have shape-dependent physical and chemical properties,which can add more degrees of freedom for manipulating the collective properties of the resultant superstructures.This is of particular interest to the fabrication of field-responsive colloidal photonic structures,i nw hich static or dynamic structural changes are usually accompanied by switching of photonic properties.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nUnlike our previously demonstrated one-dimensional photonic assembly which only shows single color stripes at areas with field parallel to the incident angle,  [5a]  the current system displays red and blue stripes at areas with parallel and horizontal fields,and atransitional green stripe in between at off-angle areas. In addition to orientation, the interplanar spacing of the photonic assemblies is also determined by the volume fractions of the nanoellipsoids.  [4b]  As the volume fraction decreases,t he distance between nanoellipsoids increases, resulting in the expansion of crystal lattice as well as redshift of reflection wavelength. In the absence of magnetic fields,the reflection spectra of photonic assemblies formed by NE-A under different volume fractions were recorded (Figure  4a ). Ther eflection peak shifted from 425 nm to 660 nm, as the volume fractions decreased from 32 %t o1 0%.

These data indicate that chloride levels started rising in the mid-19th century and began accelerating in the early twentieth century. Lake Superior's and Lake Michigan's concentrations have continued to increase steadily and currently stand at their maximum recorded levels. In contrast, lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario reached peak levels between 1965 and 1975, but then began to decline. However, recent data indicate that the chloride concentrations in these lakes are now increasing again. Because loading data are not readily available, a mass-balance model is employed to estimate the chloride inputs required to account for the concentration trends. This inverse analysis yields computed load reductions that are consistent with reported industrial load reductions during the last three decades of the 20th century. Hence, it appears that the improvements were for the most part attributable to industrial controls. The model is also used to predict that if loads are held fixed at 2006 levels, concentrations in all lakes will continue to increase with the most dramatic rise occurring in Lake Michigan which will ultimately approach the level of Lake Erie. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIntroduction\nBecause it is conservative, has low natural background levels, and is readily measured with adequate precision, chloride has long served as a general indicator of anthropogenic impacts on Great Lakes water quality. Beyond its utility as an indicator, chloride can also have direct adverse impacts on lakes and other freshwater ecosystems. The Canadian federal government has recommended that road salt be added to the List of Toxic Substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act because of tangible threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage  (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2001) . It has also been suggested that increases of chloride and other ions could be directly harmful to the Great Lakes ecosystem by fostering the spread of less-desirable halophilic organisms  (Stoermer, 1978) . More generally, trends of all major anions and cations are relevant as they contribute to aspects of lake chemistry such as ionic strength, pH and acid neutralizing capacity. Finally, at sufficiently high concentrations, chloride can influence density stratification as well as degrade the taste of drinking water. Two classic papers first established that Great Lakes chloride levels had increased significantly over the past century.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nChloride is not currently tracked in the National Pollutant Release Database. For a small number of inorganic chemical plants, the Province of Ontario requires chloride discharges to be monitored, but these likely constitute only a small portion of the total chloride releases. The fact that it is difficult to definitively understand why levels are currently increasing reinforces the need for both continued and expanded monitoring and modeling of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The USEPA and EC monitoring programs have provided an excellent database for detecting long-term trends of whole-lake concentrations. Comparison of the variability of the historical and modern data in Fig.  3  clearly demonstrates the value of having long-term, systematic data collection efforts with high quality control. Whereas the early data were certainly valuable in raising concerns, as demonstrated in the present study, a meaningful trend analysis is predicated on more precise measurements of the quality collected by EPA and EC. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said regarding direct loading measurements. Whereas major efforts were expended estimating loadings in the 1970s (notably those conducted under the auspices of the International Joint Commission), these programs have been effectively decommissioned.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs reported by  Sonzogni et al. (1983) , increases in chloride effluent concentration from these additions are on the order of 10 mg/L. Hence, the addition would not significantly increase normal effluent concentrations. Because sewage effluent is a relatively small component of the total chloride load, it is doubtful that the additional ferric chloride inputs could account for the recent increases.\n\nNew industrial sources\nThe second way in which loading might still be increasing would be if new industrial chloride discharges had begun entering the system since 1980. Because chloride loading is currently not being monitored, there is no available evidence pointing to significant new dischargers. The U.S. NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit program regulates pollutants in point-source discharges as needed to act in accordance with the technology-based, and water-quality-based requirements of the Clean Water Act. Where appropriate, NPDES permits may include limits and monitoring requirements to comply with the requirements of Effluent Guidelines, Water Quality Standards, or Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). Information regarding permit requirements is tracked using the ICIS/ PCS (Integrated Compliance Information System/Permit Compliance System) databases.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe proportion of regulated proteins closely paralleled the total number of phosphorylations of nuclear proteins. As expected, proteins annotated as extracellular were significantly underrepresented in the phosphoproteome. Although there is evidence of a mitochondrial phosphoproteome  (Pagliarini and Dixon, 2006) , proteins annotated as mitochondrial by GO were underrepresented, as were plasma membrane proteins. As membrane proteins are often of low abundance and we did not specifically enrich the plasma membrane in this analysis, we are less likely to identify phosphorylation events associated with them. Conversely, proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, which are generally of higher abundance, were almost twice as likely to be detected in the phosphoproteome as compared with their proportion in the database, and they accounted for an even higher share of the regulated sites. This illustrates that, at the current state of technology, our phosphopeptide screen is still not comprehensive. We may also miss certain phosphopeptides that are either too small or too large in mass to be readily measurable in our current MS setup. Therefore, absence of a phosphorylation site from our data set does not necessarily mean that it does not exist.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs in the case of SwissProt, close to 90% of our data are novel compared with these previous studies. Taken together, our data suggest that, despite several decades of research into phosphorylation, most in vivo phosphorylation sites have still not been detected.\n\nPhosphoproteome Dynamics\nEGF signaling begins with activation of the EGF receptor and extends through a cascade of downstream kinases to mediate the increased phosphorylation of a large number of substrate proteins. The overall levels of phosphorylated proteins within a specific cellular compartment are also affected by other processes, including dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, protein degradation via ubiquitination, and translocation of the protein to another subcellular location. Our experiment measures the net effect of all these diverse processes that collectively regulate the dynamic phosphoproteome. To search for patterns in the time profiles of the regulated phosphopeptides, we explored several clustering techniques. Clustering algorithms have been applied extensively to the analysis of gene-expression data, including time-series data sets.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAnother contributing factor may be the fact that pY is less stable in phosphoamino acid analysis than pS/pT, whereas we have found no evidence that the phosphopeptide enrichment method discriminates between these modification types. We next averaged the time profiles of the upregulated phosphorylation sites and normalized them to their maximal fold change. Figure  2D  shows that, on average, dynamic changes in tyrosine phosphorylation occur much faster and from a lower basal level compared to serine/ threonine phosphorylation. We found phosphorylation sites on a wide variety of proteins, and about half the proteins contained more than one site (Table  S2 ). Figure  2E  shows a Gene Ontology (GO)  (Zeeberg et al., 2003)  analysis of the in vivo phosphoproteome. GO localization information existed for 1,589 of the 2,244 phosphoproteins. Almost half of the phosphorylation events occurred on nuclear proteins, whereas only one-third of all proteins in the database were assigned as nuclear by GO, indicating that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Ten specimens representing different joints were used and five criteria of osteoarthritis were scored. Eleven of the 38 participants ranked themselves as beginners, 13 as experienced and six as very experienced; the data were subsequently examined using the results from these 30, comparing beginners with experts. Agreement as to whether or not changes were present on the specimens and on the degree of change was seldom complete but was greater when scoring eburnation and the presence of new bone on the joint surface than for the three other criteria. There was little difference between beginners and experts.\nAlthough all the specimens were chosen to meet our published criteria for osteoarthritis, the experts were unanimous is agreeing the diagnosis in only three cases and the beginners in only one.\nThese results suggest that more work needs to be done to develop operational definitions for the classification of disease in palaeopathology and that great care must be taken when comparing disease frequencies between studies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn general, there was better agreement about the diagnosis when eburnation was present, although three of the experts and two of the beginners did not diagnose specimen 10 as having osteoarthritis even though there was an obvious area of eburnation on the inferior surface of the head of this metatarsal. O n e practical outcome of this study must be that greater efforts will need to be taken to agree on the criteria >for the classification of pathological changes in palaeopathology. What is required for palaeopathological work is the development of operational definitions, since it is not valid entirely t o rely on either clinical or radiological diagnoses. For example, we have shown that radiology is not reliable in detecting changes that are evident to the palaeopathologist.' Finally, these results demonstrate that great care must be taken when comparing disease frequencies between studies unless the authors cite the criteria used in arriving at their classifications o r use a common, agreed source of reference.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIntroduction\nIn epidemiological studies of joint diseases, where results from different observers are to be compared, it is common to estimate the degree of variation between the observers;l'Z if the variation is small, then the conclusions drawn from such studies will have more credibility than if it is great. Now that epidemiological techniques are increasingly being applied to palaeopathology it seemed important to make some assessment of the extent of inter-observer variation amongst its practitioners when scoring diseased joints, since to the best of our knowledge this has not been attempted before.\n\nMaterials and methods\nEach of the specimens used in the study (and illustrated in Figure  1 ) was considered to have 1047-482x/91/010049-08$05.00 @ 1991 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd the features of osteoarthritis by the criteria that we have published b e f ~r e . ~ Briefly, these criteria state that osteoarthritis is present when there is eburnation on the joint surface or, in the absence of eburnation, when two of the following are present: marginal osteophytes, new bone on the joint surface, pitting on the joint surface or deformation of the joint contour.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nWe choose all ten as meeting our published criteria \u20acor osteoarthritis in palaeopathological material and so, to some extent, this was a test of the acceptance of our criteria. As it was, the experts were unanimous on three specimens only ( 1 , 3 and 6 ) and the beginners were unanimous only about specimen 6 . There was a significant difference in the number of experts and beginners only over the diagnosis of specimen 7; 94.7% of the experts considered it to have osteoarthritis but only 54.5% of the beginners. Considering this result, and some of the other results pertaining to specimen 7, it seems likely that some of the participants were scoring the wrong joint. The inferior facet joint (shown in Figure  1 ) had very obvious eburnation and scoring on the joint surface and could not possibly have been mistaken for anything other than osteoarthritis; the fact that so many people did misdiagnose it suggests that they were actually scoring the normal, superior facet joint; this, at least, is our most charitable explanation.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAlthough no polyhedral analysis was carried out, the usefulness of these inequalities has been demonstrated through computational experiments. A comparison with version 8.1 of CPLEX shows that the branch-and-cut algorithm proposed here reduces both the CPU time and the number of nodes explored in the branch-and-bound tree. The methodology proposed in this paper obviously cannot be used to solve large-scale instances containing hundreds or thousands of users as it is sometimes the case in large cities. It is, however, fast enough to be used as a post-processor to optimize individual routes or small subsets of routes produced by a meta-heuristic. In the presence of ride time constraints, using dynamic programming would be difficult since the states of the dynamic programming algorithm would have to take into account the individual ride time of each user.

Based on a combination of molecular characteristics typical of many Precambrian bitumens, their consistently and unusually high thermal maturities, and their widespread distribution throughout the Hamersley Basin, the bitumens can be characterized as \u2018probably of Archean age\u2019. Accepting this interpretation, the biomarkers open a new window on Archean biodiversity. The presence of hopanes in the Archean rocks confirms the antiquity of the domain Bacteria, and high relative concentrations of 2\u03b1-methylhopanes indicate that cyanobacteria were important primary producers. Oxygenic photosynthesis therefore evolved > 2.7 Ga ago, and well before independent evidence suggests significant levels of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. Moreover, the abundance of cyanobacterial biomarkers in shales interbedded with oxide-facies banded iron formations (BIF) indicates that although some Archean BIF might have been formed by abiotic photochemical processes or anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, those in the Hamersley Group formed as a direct consequence of biological oxygen production. Biomarkers of the 3\u03b2-methylhopane series suggest that microaerophilic heterotrophic bacteria, probably methanotrophs or methylotrophs, were active in late Archean environments. The presence of steranes in a wide range of structures with relative abundances like those from late Paleoproterozoic to Phanerozoic sediments is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean, 900 Ma before visible fossil evidence indicates that the lineage arose. Sterol biosynthesis in extant eukaryotes requires molecular oxygen. The presence of steranes together with biomarkers of oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria suggests that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in some regions of the upper water column was equivalent to at least \u223c1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) and may have been sufficient to support aerobic respiration. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSo far, the oldest known dinosteranes come from the \u03f31.1-Ga Nonesuch Shale, Michigan  (Summons and Walter, 1990) . The biologic precursor of dinosteranes is dinosterol that is commonly regarded as diagnostic for dinoflagellates  (Robinson et al., 1984; Summons et al., 1987 Summons et al., , 1992;; Moldowan et al., 1996; Moldowan and Talyzina, 1998) , although it has also been recorded in one diatom species as a minor component  (Volkman et al., 1993) . As fossil dinoflagellates (and diatoms) first appear in the Mesozoic, dinosteranes discovered in Paleozoic and Proterozoic sedimentary rocks were described as products of ancestral dinoflagellates (protodinoflagellates)  (Moldowan et al., 1996) . However, dinosteranes of Archean age have more likely a biologically independent origin, as ancestral dinoflagellates and diatoms almost certainly appeared much later in Earth history.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nSterols with the 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestane skeleton (C 30 ) have also been isolated from prymnesiophyte algae of the order Pavlovales  (Volkman et al., 1990) , and with the 4-methylcholestane skeleton (C 28 ) from the methylotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus  (Bird et al., 1971) . Regular 4-methylsteranes are therefore not sufficiently taxon-specific to interpret their occurrence in Archean bitumen below domain level. 4\u2423,23,24-Trimethylcholestanes (dinosteranes) also occur in trace amounts in the Archean bitumens  (Brocks et al., 2003) . Dinosteranes are abundant biomarkers in almost all Mesozoic and Cenozoic bitumens  (Moldowan et al., 1996)  but have also been detected in the Paleozoic and Proterozoic, albeit in lower concentrations  (Moldowan et al., 1996) .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMost bitumens throughout post-Archean Earth history contain similar distributions of C 26 to C 30 -steranes, A-ring methylated steranes, mono-and triaromatic steroids and their diagenetic rearrangement products  (Summons et al., 1988b) . The late Archean bitumens studied here also have the same general sterane and aromatic steroid pattern  (Brocks et al., 2003) . It is highly unlikely that such steranes in Phanerozoic and Proterozoic sediments had an eukaryotic source but had a prokaryotic origin in the Archean. Although it is possible that as yet unknown or extinct prokaryotic organisms produced sterols, the wide structural range of steranes present, their relative abundances like those of younger bitumens, and their marked dissimilarity to known prokaryotic examples is convincing evidence for the existence of eukaryotes in the late Archean  (contra Cavalier-Smith, 2002) . Although sterane distributions in the Archean bitumens are equivalent to those of younger bitumens, they offer no taxonomic information below domain level.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here it is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that proper intensification of ionized impurity scattering to charge carriers can benefit the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) by increasing the Seebeck coefficient and decreasing the electronic thermal conductivity. The optimal strength of ionized impurity scattering for maximum ZT depends on the Fermi level and the density of states effective mass. Cr\u2010doping in CeyCo4Sb12 progressively increases the strength of ionized impurity scattering, and significantly improves the Seebeck coefficient, resulting in high power factors of 45 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 with relatively low electrical conductivity. This effect, combined with the increased Ce\u2010filling fraction and thus decreased lattice thermal conductivity by charge compensation of Cr\u2010dopant, gives rise to a maximum ZT of 1.3 at 800 K and a large average ZT of 1.1 between 500 and 850 K, \u224830% and \u224820% enhancements as compared with those of Cr\u2010free sample, respectively. Furthermore, this study also reveals that carrier scattering parameter can be another fundamental degree of freedom to optimize electrical properties and improve thermal\u2010to\u2010electricity conversion efficiencies of thermoelectric materials. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n[ 14, 18, 24 ]  This effect is analogue to the prediction by Ioffe  [ 25 ]  about a half century ago, however, rather precise control of the impurity scattering strength is required to realize power factor and ZT improvements in heavily doped semiconductors.  [ 26 ]  Indeed, Ioffe's initial experimental work about PbTe gave no enhancement in power factor or ZT ,  [ 25 ]  and subsequently numerical calculations done by Ure  [ 24 ]  predicted no more than 10% enhancement in ZT by introducing ionized impurities. These may have contributed to the dormancy of studying the infl uence of ionized impurity scattering on thermoelectrics, and to the best of our knowledge only limited experimental results have been reported.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n[ 24 ]  The increase in the Seebeck coeffi cient, due to the fi ltering of low-energy electrons by ionized impurity scattering, compensates or even overcompensates the reduction of mobility, giving rise to the power factor enhancement. This effect is in principle analogues to the fi ltering effect created by energy barriers.  [ 3 ]  Particularly, thermal conductivity can also be lowered due to the reduced electronic contribution and the intensifi ed phonon point defect scattering, and thus a large enhancement in ZT can be expected. The comparisons between the experimental data and the numerical calculations (solid lines) are shown in Figure  3  b-d. These calculations without any adjustable parameter show good agreement with the experimental results, especially for the Seebeck coeffi cient and the electrical conductivity. The discrepancies are mainly attributed to the variation of the Fermi level, as indicated in Table  1  . This further verifi es the rationality of the present simple model. The fi ts between calculated and experimental power factors are less satisfactory, mainly due to the variation of \u03b7 and large uncertainty of PF (\u224810%).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n[ 18, 27 ]  The strength of ionized impurity scattering depends not only on the effective concentration of impurities but also on\n\nOn Intensifying Carrier Impurity Scattering to Enhance Thermoelectric Performance in Cr-Doped Ce y Co 4 Sb 12\nShanyu Wang , Jiong Yang , Lihua Wu , Ping Wei , Wenqing Zhang , * and Jihui Yang * The benefi cial effect of impurity scattering on thermoelectric properties has long been disregarded even though possible improvements in power factor have been suggested by Ioffe more than a half century ago.

It is an integral (Fock) operator for hybrids but a differential operator [citation 31] for meta-GGAs, the same operator for occupied and unoccupied one-electron states.\n    \n# The reference article \nTitle: More realistic band gaps from meta-generalized gradient approximations: Only in a generalized Kohn-Sham scheme \nAbstract: Unlike the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), calculations with meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGA) are usually done according to the generalized Kohn-Sham (gKS) formalism. The exchange-correlation potential of the gKS equation is nonmultiplicative, which prevents systematic comparison of meta-GGA band structures to those of the LDA and the GGA. We implement the optimized effective potential (OEP) of the meta-GGA for periodic systems, which allows us to carry out meta-GGA calculations in the same KS manner as for the LDA and the GGA. We apply the OEP to several meta-GGAs, including the new SCAN functional [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)]. We find that the KS gaps and KS band structures of meta-GGAs are close to those of GGAs. They are smaller than the more realistic gKS gaps of meta-GGAs, but probably close to the less-realistic gaps in the band structure of the exact KS potential, as can be seen by comparing with the gaps of the EXX+ RPA OEP potential. The well-known grid sensitivity of meta-GGAs is much more severe in OEP calculations. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nUsing integration by parts, the matrix elements \u03c8 ik\u03c3 vgKS XC,\u03c3 \u03c8 jk\u03c3 becomes - 1 2 d 3 r\u03c8 * ik\u03c3 (r)\u2207 \u2022 \u2202e XC \u2202\u03c4 \u03c3 (r)\u2207\u03c8 jk\u03c3 (r) = 1 2 d 3 r \u2202e XC \u2202\u03c4 \u03c3 (r)\u2207\u03c8 * ik\u03c3 (r) \u2022 \u2207\u03c8 jk\u03c3 (r), (16) and \u2202e XC /\u2202\u03c4 is less sensitive to the grid than \u2207\u2202e XC /\u2202\u03c4 . The grid sensitivity of the OEP is also expected to show up in the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)  65  with a meta-GGA xc kernel. Aside from the grid problem, we find that the OEP meta-GGA in general needs more self-consistent-field (SCF) cycles to reach convergence than the gKS meta-GGA. For small gap materials, the OEPs of some meta-GGA functionals do not converge, while the corresponding gKS calculations converge normally.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n(4) Eq. (  4 ) can be partitioned into a GGA-like part and a \u03c4 -dependent part: v XC,\u03c3 (r) = v GGA XC,\u03c3 (r) + v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 (r). ( 5 ) v GGA XC,\u03c3 is a multiplicative potential, but v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 does not have a closed form. v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 can be written as v \u03c4 -dep XC,\u03c3 (r) = 1 \u2126 BZ i BZ d 3 k V cell d 3 r \u2032 d 3 r \u2032\u2032 \u2202e XC \u2202\u03c4 \u03c3 (r \u2032 ) \u00d7 \u03b4\u03c4 \u03c3 (r \u2032 ) \u03b4\u03c8 ik\u03c3 (r \u2032\u2032 ) \u03b4\u03c8 ik\u03c3 (r \u2032\u2032 ) \u03b4n \u03c3 (r) + c.c. . (6) On one hand, the gKS meta-GGA potential operator is obtained by multiplying both side of Eq.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nTherefore a function with sharp features in regions away from the nuclei cannot be properly represented on the grid, and the error of integrations involving this function would be large. One needs larger grids in gKS meta-GGA calculations than those used in GGA calculations. We find that the OEP meta-GGA is more sensitive to the real-space integration grid than the gKS meta-GGA. In the gKS case, the sensitivity to the grid shows up in the potential energy surface  63, 64  as spurious oscillations, but the sensitivity is not obvious in a single-point calculation. In the OEP case, a single-point calculation is enough to demonstrate the grid sensitivity by comparing the total energy. The total energy of the OEP meta-GGA variationally minimized with respect to the charge density, but the total energy of the gKS meta-GGA is variationally minimized with respect to the orbitals. Since the gKS has bigger variational degrees of freedom, the gKS total energy should always be lower than the OEP total energy, and both should be lower than the meta-GGA total energy evaluated with non-variational orbitals.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

The aim of our study was to assess the functional state of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling in patients with MS. Tr1 cells were induced in vitro by activation with anti-CD46 antibodies in controls and patients with MS. Cells were phenotyped by cytometry and suppression assays, and the expression of cytokines and transcription factors was evaluated by real-time PCR, ELISA, cytometry and Western blotting. We found that the activity of Tr1 cells and IL-10R signaling is impaired in MS patients since Tr1 cells isolated from MS patients produced less IL-10 than those obtained from controls. Indeed, the supernatants from Tr1 cells from controls did not suppress the proliferation of stimulated CD4(+) cells from patients with MS. Furthermore, the IL-10R signaling pathway was not fully active in CD4(+) cells from MS patients and these cells had higher baseline levels of SOCS3 transcripts than controls. Indeed, after in vitro IL-10 stimulation, the expression levels of the STAT1, STAT3 and IL-10RA genes were higher in MS patients than in controls. Moreover, Stat-3 phosphorylation was lower in controls than in patients after IL-10 stimulation. These results indicate that IL-10 regulatory function is impaired in patients with MS. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRecently, Astier et al.  [21]  demonstrated that Tr1 function is also impaired in patients with MS. Moreover, the expression of the immunosuppressor cytokine IL-10 is diminished in MS patients  [22, 23] , in accordance with previous studies describing fewer IL-10-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Interestingly, there is a reduction in the expression of IL-10 but elevated numbers of PBMC expressing IL-10 transcripts before clinical relapse in MS  [24] , and there is a correlation between IL-10 levels and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients  [25] . Engineered Th2/Tr1 cells that produce high levels of IL-10 prevent epitope spreading and ameliorate the disease course in animal models of MS  [26] . However, it is unknown whether the functional activity of IL-10 in MS is preserved, and attempts to treat MS patients with IL-10 have not been successful to date.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOver the next 7 days, the Tr1 cells maintained the activation and memory phenotype, but they produced less IL-10. After a second stimulation 10 days later, the majority of the cells showed a CD25 + CD45RO + activation/memory phenotype (65%; Fig.  1D ) and they also augmented the levels of both intracellular (Fig.  1D ) and secreted IL-10 protein (Fig.  1E ; p <0.05 in all cases). Finally, we assessed whether Tr1 cells acted as regulatory Tcells, by assessing the capacity of the secreted cytokines (mainly IL-10) to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. We found that the supernatants from Tr1 cell cultures, containing high levels of IL-10 (in the range of 5580-7533 pg/mL), as well as recombinant IL-10, were able to suppress the proliferation of CD4 + Tcells (Fig.  1F ; p <0.001).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n1F ; p <0.001). This suppression was impaired in the presence of the anti-IL-10 antibody, confirming that the suppression was mediated by IL-10 (Fig.  1F ). Thus, in accordance with earlier data  [14] , we confirm that CD46 stimulation of CD4 + cells induces a Tr1-like phenotype and that this phenotype is stable in culture for 20 days, although IL-10 production is dependent on further TCR stimulation. When the same CD46-induced Tr1 induction protocol was applied to CD4 + cells from untreated patients with MS (n = 11), we found that there was a similar increase in the expression of the CD25 and CD45RO activation and memory markers, as well as in intracellular and secreted IFN-c (Fig.  2A, B ). However, both the intracellular and secreted levels of IL-10 produced by Tr1 cells from MS patients were significantly lower at day 3 than those from HC (Fig.  2A, C ; p <0.05 in both cases).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-I) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered IFN-\u03b2 are partly mediated by AhR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AhR agonists that act on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AhR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe microbial flora and its products have been shown to control T cell-dependent inflammation through several mechanisms including the conversion of precursors provided by the diet into immune regulatory metabolites  [13] [14] [15]  . However, less is known about the effects of the diet and microbial products on the inflammatory response of resident cells in the CNS. Here we identify an IFN-I and AhR axis that integrates immunologic, metabolic and environmental cues to regulate astrocyte activity and CNS inflammation.\n\nResults\n\n\nAstrocytes show a transcriptional response to IFN-I during EAE\nTo study the regulation of astrocyte function during autoimmune CNS inflammation, we induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG 35-55 ) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and analyzed mRNA expression in astrocytes by RNA-sequencing (Supplementary Figs.  1a, b ).

These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.\nAstrocytes are the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system (CNS). They participate in diverse functions including control of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the regulation of metabolism, the modulation of neuronal transmission and CNS development and repair  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  . Astrocytes also play important roles during CNS injury and disease, and are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)  [10] [11] [12]  . Astrocyte activity is affected by factors produced within and outside the CNS, therefore, the study of these factors may shed light on the regulation of astrocyte function in health and disease and identify new therapeutic approaches for human neurologic disorders.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nMoreover, our results identify a molecular pathway through which the diet in cooperation with the commensal flora modulate the activity of CNS resident cells and neuroinflammation. In addition, the regulation of AhR expression by IFN-\u03b2 suggest that the microbiome may affect not only the development of CNS autoimmunity, but also its response to disease modifying therapies  60  . Thus, the study of the metabolic and environmental factors that regulate astrocyte activity may shed light on CNS physiology, identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and drive the development of more efficacious therapeutic interventions for MS and other neurologic diseases.\n\nOnline Methods\n\n\nAnimals\nC57BL/6J, Ifnar1 -/-, IL-27ra -/-, GFAP-Cre, and AhR fl/fl mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and were all female. Mice with a specific deletion of AhR in astrocytes were generated by crossing GFAP-Cre and AhR fl/fl mice, efficient deletion of AhR in astrocytes was verified by PCR and Western blotting (data not shown).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Experimental immunization with sporozoites induces this type of protective response, but the extremely large number of proteins expressed by Plasmodium parasites has so far prohibited the identification of sufficient discrete T-cell antigens to develop subunit vaccines that produce sterile immunity. Here, using mice singly immunized with Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites and high-throughput screening, we identified a unique CTL response against the parasite ribosomal L3 protein. Unlike CTL responses to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the population of L3-specific CTLs was not expanded by multiple sporozoite immunizations. CSP is abundant in the sporozoite itself, whereas L3 expression does not increase until the liver stage. The response induced by a single immunization with sporozoites reduces the parasite load in the liver so greatly during subsequent immunizations that L3-specific responses are only generated during the primary exposure. Functional L3-specific CTLs can, however, be expanded by heterologous prime-boost regimens. Thus, although repeat sporozoite immunization expands responses to preformed antigens like CSP that are present in the sporozoite itself, this immunization strategy may not expand CTLs targeting parasite proteins that are synthesized later. Heterologous strategies may be needed to increase CTL responses across the entire spectrum of Plasmodium liver-stage proteins. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn this study, homologous sporozoite immunizations resulted in boosting of CSP-specific, but not L3-specific, CD8 + T-cell responses. Previous reports show that when multiple homologous sporozoite immunizations were given at 48-h intervals, there was no significant increase in CSP-specific CD8 T-cell expansion compared with a single dose of sporozoites (  47 ). This so-called \"self-regulation\" was due to antigen-specific CD8 + T cells that could eliminate antigen-presenting DCs  (48)  and prevent the further expansion of naive CD8 + T cells specific for the same antigen. This phenomenon is thought to mimic the situation in hyperendemic field settings, where humans sometimes receive multiple malaria-infected mosquito bites daily. When the interval between immunizations is extended to a week or more as in our studies, we and others  (27)  find that endogenous CSP-specific CD8 + T cells in fact increase in frequency after repeated sporozoite immunizations. Thus, CSP-specific T cells do not appear to be affected by self-regulation using our vaccination approach.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nLooking beyond CSP-specific cells, previous phenotyping of bulk CD8 + T cells showed that some portion of memory T-cell responses could be boosted by repeated sporozoite exposures. Lymphocytes from mice treated with homologous sporozoite immunizations showed an increase in the frequency of memory CD8 + T cells at a memory timepoint  (37) . We predict that  such increases following repeat sporozoite immunizations are responses against preformed or early liver stage antigens. Thus, with the right immunization interval, some CD8 + T-cell responses appear to boost in response to homologous sporozoite exposures. In contrast to CSP-specific T cells, L3-specific CD8 + T cells failed to boost after repeated sporozoite immunizations. We first looked to see whether there were functional defects in L3-specific cells, but these cells were capable of killing peptide-coated target cells in an antigen-specific manner and could be restimulated with other forms of antigen. Instead, we found that the lack of L3specific CTL expansion following secondary sporozoite immunization was likely due to the strong antisporozoite immune response that essentially prevents L3 expression.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nSimilar to the behavior of CSP-specific cells following multiple sporozoite immunizations, these heterologous prime-boost approaches expanded the population of activated (CD11a HI CD62L LO CD44 HI ) L3-specific T cells by 0.74 or 1.67 log 10 cells per spleen for L3 peptide-pulsed DC or GAP priming, respectively, compared with the appropriately matched Lm-L3 priming immunization alone (Fig.  4  F and G). Thus, in contrast to multiple sporozoite immunizations, a heterologous prime-boost approach expanded the L3-specific population and maintained its activated phenotype.\n\nPrior Sporozoite Immunization Eliminates L3 Expression and Liver Stage Parasite Development and Prevents the Boosting of Responses Against\nLate Liver Stage Antigens. Heterologous prime-boost studies presented above suggested that functional memory L3 CTLs were formed by priming with sporozoites.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Here, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy study of gate-tunable tBLG devices supported by atomically smooth and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (BN). The high quality of these tBLG devices allows identification of coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns and moir\u00e9 super-superlattices produced by graphene-graphene and graphene-BN interlayer interactions. Furthermore, we examine additional tBLG spectroscopic features in the local density of states beyond the first van Hove singularity. Our experimental data are explained by a theory of moir\u00e9 bands that incorporates ab initio calculations and confirms the strongly nonperturbative character of tBLG interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAlthough coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns have previously been observed in graphitic multilayers  [9, 10] , we demonstrate here that moir\u00e9 patterns produced by graphene-graphene interlayer interactions can coincide with moir\u00e9 patterns that arise from graphene-BN interactions to produce a new supersuperlattice structure. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of tBLG/BN yield new insight into how the intrinsic electronic behavior of tBLG is affected by moir\u00e9-induced interactions. For example, we observe an additional dip feature in the DOS at an energy beyond the first VHS. By comparing the moir\u00e9 wavelength dependence of this new feature's energy to calculations incorporating ab initio results, we find that it arises from a partial gap opening between the second and third moir\u00e9 bands due to strong non-perturbative interlayer coupling in the small twist-angle regime. These measurements on our high quality tBLG/BN samples provide a first look into the atomic-scale behavior of electrostatically gated tBLG, an important device configuration for future applications  [28, 29] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nOur measurements were performed using an Omicron ultra-high vacuum (UHV) STM operating at temperature T = 5 K with electrochemically etched PtIr tips. The tips were calibrated against the surface state of an Au(111) crystal before performing all measurements  [30] . Differential conductance (dI/dV) was measured by lock-in detection of the a.c. tunnel current modulated by a 6-8 meV (rms), 400-700 Hz signal added to the sample bias (V s ). Each tBLG device was fabricated by growing two monolayers of graphene via chemical vapor deposition (CVD)  [31]  and then sequentially transferring the layers onto a BN flake peeled onto an SiO 2 /Si wafer (see Fig.  1 (a) for a schematic of a typical graphene device; see Ref.  [32]  for more details about the growth and transfer processes). The samples were annealed in UHV at 400 for several hours to clean them before loading them into the STM.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThese results show that the strong coupling, low twist-angle regime in tBLG can be accessed using scanned probe techniques via high quality devices that allow electrostatic Fermi level tuning.

The results have important implications for understanding water adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces and the penetration of water into hydrophobic phases. Protein folding, membrane formation, micellar assembly, and wetting are a few of the many processes in which the interaction of water with hydrophobic fluid surfaces plays an important role. A driving force behind these processes is an uncommonly large entropy loss, which is usually explained as an enhanced structuring of water in the immediate vicinity of apolar molecules, biological macromolecules, and hydrophobic surfaces. Experimental measurements that provide a molecular-level view of interfacial water structure and hydrogen bonding at these interfaces have proven to be problematic because of the difficulty in selectively examining interfacial water molecules. Hence, most of our understanding of the molecular structure of water at hydrophobic surfaces comes from theory (1-7).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis energy is more than 10 times the kinetic energy, kT, available for thermal fluctuations. Homogeneous density fluctuations of the observed magnitude can only be thermal in nature if a reduction of W, by at least a factor of 10, is effective in this 2-nm-wide mica pore. This simple estimate is in excellent agreement with the sixfold reduction in transition enthalpies for cyclohexane in 4-nm porous silica, measured by means of DSC  (32) . Molecules within 2 to 3 nm of the surface are thought to form a layer of thermally fluctuating optical and mechanical properties, as a consequence of the surface-induced decoupling of energy and density changes.

To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3%) of 1,505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSince other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion  [4] , several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1,505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.\n\nBackground\nZIKAV, an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus  [5] , was first isolated in 1947 from a monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda  [6] . Sporadic human Zika fever cases have been reported since the 1960s  [7] . The first documented outbreak outside Africa and Asia occurred in 2007 in the Yap State, Micronesia, in the North Pacific, where Zika fever was characterised by rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia  [8] . ZIKAV has been isolated from several Aedes mosquito species, notably including Ae. aegypti  [9]  and Ae.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFor ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections. Arbovirus transfusionderived transmission has been reported principally for WNV  [19] , DENV  [20]  and chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  [21, 22] . For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high  [21, 22] . During the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007)  [21]  and in R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-07)  [22] , blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia. Due to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR  [16] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \naegypti  [9]  and Ae. albopictus  [10] . Ae. aegypti is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and Ae. albopictus is now established in many parts of Europe, especially Mediterranean countries  [11] . Recent reports of imported cases of ZIKAV infection from south-east Asia or the Pacific to Europe  [12]  or Japan  [13]  highlight the risk of ZIKAV emergence in parts of the world where the vector is present.\n\nSample collection\nAccording to the procedures of the blood bank centre of French Polynesia, all blood donors have to fill in a pre-donation questionnaire and have a medical examination before blood donation. Blood is taken only from voluntary donors who are asymptomatic at the time of donation. A signed informed consent statement was obtained from all blood donors and publication of data related to ZIKAV testing was approved by the Ethics Committee of French Polynesia (reference 66/CEPF). ZIKAV nucleic acid testing (NAT) of samples of all donations was implemented routinely from 13 January 2014.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

How caspase-11 executes these downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 maturation. A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1\u03b2 secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, Gsdmd(-/-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Gram-negative bacteria. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nLoss of NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1 in BMDMs did not markedly affect caspase-11-dependent generation of mature Gsdmd p30 in response to cytoplasmic LPS (Fig.  4a ), indicating that Gsdmd cleavage occurs upstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The question arises as to whether Gsdmd induces pyroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation simultaneously in the same cell, or if Gsdmd-mediated pyroptosis releases damage-associated molecular patterns  29  that trigger caspase-11-independent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neighbouring cells (Extended Data Fig.  6a ). We believe the latter hypothesis is unlikely because LPS-stimulated Il1b 2/2 BMDMs exhibited normal pyroptosis, yet their culture supernatant failed to induce IL-1b secretion from Casp11 2/2 BMDMs (Extended Data Fig.  6b, c ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \n3c ). Collectively, these data indicate that caspase-11 directly cleaves the 53-kDa inactive precursor form of Gsdmd (pro-Gsdmd) to generate the propyroptotic N-terminal fragment (Gsdmd p30, Fig.  1b ). In full-length Gsdmd, the C terminus may mask key sites in the N terminus until cleavage at D 276 #G 277 releases this inhibition. Consistent with this notion, reconstitution of immortalized Gsdmd 2/2 macrophages with wild-type Gsdmd restored LPS responsiveness, as evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, IL-1b secretion and caspase-1 processing, whereas reconstitution with the Gsdmd processing mutant D276A did not (Fig.  3d, e ). In addition, mutation of Gsdmd within the p30 fragment (I105N) attenuated pyroptosis and caspase-1/IL-1b processing (Fig.  1b , e and Extended Data Fig.  2b ) without affecting Gsdmd cleavage (Extended Data Fig.  4b ).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe redefined non-canonical inflammasome signalling pathway (Fig.  4c ) refutes the previous hypothesis that a caspase-1/11 complex is responsible for caspase-1 activation 1,  36  . The partial contribution of Gsdmd to caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis suggests the existence of other pro-pyroptotic caspase-1 substrates (Fig.  5d ). Caspase-1 can trigger pyroptosis in the absence of Gsdmd, which is not unexpected because non-mammalian vertebrates lack Gsdmd yet still exhibit caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis  14, 25, 32, 39  . The co-emergence of caspase-4/5/11 and Gsdmd genes in the early stages of mammalian evolution might indicate co-evolution, perhaps in response to the need for additional anti-pathogen responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Like other caspases, caspase-11 cleaves multiple substrates  28, 31, 40  .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

In anesthetized C57Bl/6J mice Nec-1 (1.65 mg/kg), given intraperitoneally to coincide with reperfusion following left anterior descending artery ligation (30 min), also reduced infarct size from 45.3 +/- 5.1% (control) to 26.6 +/- 4.0% (p < 0.05), whilst Nec-1i (1.74 mg/kg) was ineffective (37.8 +/- 6.0%). Stimulus-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in rat cardiomyocytes, as reflected by the time until mitochondrial depolarisation, was unaffected by Nec-1 or Nec-1i at 30 muM but increased at 100 muM i.e. 91% (p < 0.05 vs control) and 152% (p < 0.001) for Nec-1 and Nec-1i, respectively.\nConclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that necrostatins inhibit myocardial cell death and reduce infarct size, possibly via a mechanism independent of the MPTP. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n1  for chemical structures of Nec-1 and Nec-1i). The same authors claimed that Nec-1 produced its actions via inhibition of a form of cell death distinct from necrosis and apoptosis which they termed necroptosis  [12] . More recently sitosterol-induced death in macrophages was reported to be caspaseindependent and blocked by Nec-1, and again it was suggested that necroptosis (and autophagy) might be involved  [13] , although considerably more work will be required before necroptosis can be unequivocally confirmed as representing a distinct entity. Protection against I/R injury in the heart and the brain could involve similar mechanisms and this could extend to the particular cell-signaling pathways or enzymes that are activated or down-regulated during the recovery process  [14] . As Nec-1 has been shown to limit cellular damage in the brain we decided to ascertain whether it could produce a similar action in the myocardium. To investigate this we used a variety of in vitro experimental models.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAn examination of the effects of necrostatins on cell signaling pathways involved in cardioprotection will aid in the characterisation of these agents  [4] . The advent of newer and possibly more potent forms of the necrostatins will also assist in this process  [22] . In conclusion, as discussed by Degterev et al.  [12]  necrosis and apoptosis play key roles in a variety of pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction, and the identification of compounds such as the necrostatins which may target the proposed alternative death pathway, necroptosis, may lead to the development of more effective therapies. Our data are the first to indicate that necrostatin is protective against I/R injury in the myocardium, possibly via mechanisms other than those that are generally accepted as being involved (i.e. apoptosis and necrosis)  [23] . It should be stressed, however, that these are preliminary studies.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs delaying MPTP opening is believed to represent a key factor with respect to cardioprotection and may be linked to apoptosis, our failure to show a delay with lower Nec-1 concentrations may be consistent with the findings of Degterev and colleagues  [12] , who claimed that the effects produced by Nec-1 are mediated by a mechanism distinct from necrosis and apoptosis, namely necroptosis. As suggested by Formigli et al.  [20]  for a process they termed aponecrosis and claimed shared characteristics with apoptosis and necrosis, necroptosis could represent one of a continuum of death processes with apoptosis and necrosis occurring at its two extremes  [20] . Clearly, however, before any firm conclusions can be made regarding necroptosis and the mode(s) of action of necrostatins in the context of myocardial infarction more detailed studies, possibly involving the use of Nec-1 in combination with caspase inhibitors (inhibitors which block apoptotic pathways), should be carried out  [21] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Evidence was obtained for different sites of binding of different antibodies and direct correspondence was observed between these sites and the locations of antigenic sites A, B, and E defined by determining the amino acids recognized by the specific antibodies. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThe nucleotide sequence changes determined in the HA1 regions of appropriate antigenic variants, which serve to define the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies used, are given in Table  1 . Electron microscopy. BHA was dilnted in PBS (pH 7.2) to 50 pg/ml for optimum spreading on carbon support films. Antibody was added in increasing amounts until only a few molecules remained unbound to BHA after about 5 min equilibration. BHA-antibody complex suspensions were adsorbed to thin carbon films freshly stripped from mica, floated on a 1% w/v solution of sodium silicotungstate (pH 7.0) and then air dried. Micrographs were taken under minimum dose conditions known from analyses of periodic specimens to preserve detail below 1.5 nm; defocus was such that phase contrast was transferred in a continuous band down to about 1.0 nm  (Wrigley et al., 1983) . amination of the other antibody combinations although the position and binding angle of HC3; HC19, and HC45 are less easy to distinguish from one another than from HC31.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n3 ) presumably because of the binding of a second antibody to an unoccupied equivalent region of the BHA trimer is sterically prevented by the first antibody bound. The sites of antibody binding and the locations of amino acid substitutions in the BIIAs of antigenie variants can also be considered in relation to the thxee-dimensional structure of the BHA, Fig.  6 . These considerations indicate that the sites of amino acid substitution are in all four cases appropriately located to be involved directly in the antibody-binding sites. In the case of HC31 they also indicate the basis of the steric inhibition of the binding of a second antibody to the BHA. Since the three 198 residues recognized are only 15 A apart around the threefold axis of the trimer, the BHA is effectively monovalent at this site. The results therefore substantiate the positions of antigenic sites A, B, and E and in the ease of site B give an indication of the extent of this region at the distal tip of the BHA molecule.

We consider alternatives to ETH that have been proposed. We first show that von Neumann's quantum ergodic theorem relies on an assumption that is essentially equivalent to ETH. We also investigate whether, following a sudden quench, special classes of pure states can lead to thermal behavior in systems that do not obey ETH, namely, integrable systems. We find examples of this, but only for initial states that obeyed ETH before the quench. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nThis dephasing mechanism accounts for the approach to thermal equilibrium for an initially out-of-equilibrium state  [2, 5] . The Quantum Ergodic Theorem: In 1929, von Neumann proved a mathematical result which has been dubbed the quantum ergodic theorem (QET)  [11] . An exegesis of it has been given by Goldstein et al. (hereafter GLTZ)  [12] . GLTZ summarize QET, or \"normal typicallity\" as it has been more recently known, as follows: \"for a typical finite family of commuting macroscopic observables, every initial wave function from a micro-canonical energy shell so evolves that for most times \u03c4 in the long run, the joint probability distribution of these observables obtained from |\u03c8(\u03c4 ) is close to their microcanonical distribution\"  [12] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nETH has been verified numerically in a wide variety of quantum many-body systems that are sufficiently far (in parameter space) from points of integrability  [5] [6] [7] [8] , but it certainly does not hold in systems that are integrable or near integrable  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Let |\u03c8(\u03c4 ) be the quantum state of the system at time \u03c4 , given by the evolution of some initial state |\u03c8 I = \u03b1 C \u03b1 |\u03b1 , |\u03c8(\u03c4 ) = e -i \u0124\u03c4 / |\u03c8 I = \u03b1 C \u03b1 e -iE\u03b1\u03c4 / |\u03b1 , (1) with \u03b1 |C \u03b1 | 2 = 1. The energy of the system is \u0112 = \u03b1 |C \u03b1 | 2 E \u03b1 , and the quantum energy uncertainty is \u2206E, where (\u2206E) 2 = \u03b1 |C \u03b1 | 2 (E \u03b1 -\u0112) 2 .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAs already noted, ETH can be justified by various results from quantum chaos theory. Thus, ETH provides a physical basis for the technical condition needed by QET. This results in a unification of two formerly disparate schools of thought on the foundations of statistical mechanics. Quantum Quenches: As mentioned in the introduction, ETH has been shown to be satisfied in a variety of nonintegrable quantum systems. It has been found to breakdown only as one approaches integrable points  [6] [7] [8] , or in special regimes that are dominated by finite size effects, e.g., close to the atomic limit  [14, 15] . Thermalization itself has been shown to be robust in nonintegrable systems after a (sudden) quench, once again, failing to occur close to integrable points  [6, 16, 17]  or the atomic limit  [15, 18] , and in localized disordered systems  [19] . Here, by (sudden) quench, we mean that the system is prepared in an eigenstate of some initial Hamiltonian (not necessarily the ground state) and then at \u03c4 = 0 the Hamiltonian is changed.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Most recently, the first active specific immunotherapeutic approach, a cancer vaccine, has passed the final phase of human testing and its approval by the FDA is pending. However, evidence suggests that the full protective and therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines has not yet been achieved. Through multiple mechanisms, tumors promote conditions in the tumor-bearing host that mitigate or even eliminate the vaccine-induced antitumor response. Restoration of the impaired immune function is, therefore, imperative for achieving optimum vaccine efficacy. Targeted pharmacological interventions are capable of overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, and thereby enable cancer vaccination to reach its full therapeutic potential. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n65  In this regard, the competitive IDO inhibitor 1methyltryptophan (1MT) significantly delays Figure  2  | elevated numbers of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer. Tumor cells, for example renal cell carcinoma, secrete a variety of bioactive products that stimulate mobilization of immature myeloid cells from bone marrow into the peripheral blood. These cells are profoundly immunosuppressive and support tumor growth via inhibition of adaptive immune responses. By contrast, the proportion of T H 1-biased dendritic cells and their immediate precursors are reduced in patients with cancer. Both the secreted products and myeloid cells are candidates for targeted therapies to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccines (red text). Finally, many tumor-recruited myeloid cells migrate into tumor tissues where they support tumor growth via local immunosuppression and stimulation of neoangiogenesis (see Figure  3 ).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nMDSCs can be divided into two major cate gories, namely CD33 + CD11b + myelomonocytic cells  [18] [19] [20]  and CD15 + CD11b + CD14 -granulocytetype cells.  [20] [21] [22]  Both these cell types are profoundly immunosuppressive and represent independent lineages that arise from myeloid precursor cells. A typical hallmark of MDSCs is the overexpression of arginase 1, a key enzyme in the inhibi tion of Tcell responses.  23, 24  Moreover, oxidative stress and secretion of nitric oxide (NO) by MDSCs contribute to the hostile, immunosuppressive tumor micro environment by attenuating Tcell function.  [25] [26] [27] [28]  MDSCs are frequently detected in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic RCC  18, 19, 21, 29  or bladder carcinoma (e. eruslanov, personal communication).

It is well known that in these processes cell movements can be guided by gradients of various chemical signals. In this study, we demonstrate that cell movement can also be guided by purely physical interactions at the cell-substrate interface. We cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 fibroblasts on flexible polyacrylamide sheets coated with type I collagen. A transition in rigidity was introduced in the central region of the sheet by a discontinuity in the concentration of the bis-acrylamide cross-linker. Cells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate \"durotaxis.\" In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nRESULTS\n\n\n3T3 cells migrate preferentially toward stiff substrate\nTo explore whether cell movement can be guided by substrate rigidity, we cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 cells on collagen-coated polyacrylamide sheets that contained a gradient of rigidity, with a Young's modulus varying between 140 and 300 kdyn/cm 2 . Regions of high and low rigidity were created by manipulating the bis-acrylamide concentration while maintaining a constant concentration of total acrylamide concentration and were identified by including fluorescent beads in one side of the substrate. The same results were obtained by placing fluorescent beads in either the stiff or the soft side. The surface in the transition region stayed on the same plane of focus, indicating that there was no sharp change in substrate height. Based on the distribution of beads, we estimated the transition area between high and low rigidity to be 50 -100 m in width. After seeding for \u03f315 h, the migration of cells was recorded by time-lapse phase microscopy over a period of 10 h. To minimize the effects of intercellular mechanical interactions through the elastic substrate, we used a low cell density and focused only on individual cells without neighbors in the observation field.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nFrom these observations, one may predict that cells are capable of responding to substrate rigidity through a true active tactile exploration process, by exerting contractile forces and then interpreting the substrate deformation to determine a preferred direction or destination of their movements  (Pelham and Wang, 1997; Sheetz et al., 1998) . Our approach to testing this hypothesis consists of putting motile National Institutes of Health 3T3 cells on collagencoated polyacrylamide substrates with a rigidity gradient, under conditions such that the only way the cells can detect this stiffness gradient is by a process of active tactile exploration. Our results indicate that 3T3 fibroblasts can in-deed detect and respond to substrate stiffness. Furthermore, the cell consistently migrates in the direction of increasing stiffness. To confirm the involvement of a force-sensing mechanism, we have also shown that the direction of cell movement can be guided by manipulating mechanical strain within the flexible substrate. The observed coupling between strain and movement is exactly as required to produce a preference for hard materials. Parallel measurements indicate that cells generate stronger traction forces and spread to a larger size on stiff substrates than on soft substrates.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nAt high densities, cells from the soft or the stiff side can move freely across the rigidity gradient, most likely as a result of pulling or pushing forces from neighbor cells transmitted via direct contact or through the elastic substrate. These forces are analogous to our external manipulations in that they send additional mechanical signals into the recipient cell, confusing its substrate probing process. This explains why, unlike the phenomena of haptotaxis  (Carter, 1965 (Carter, , 1967;; Harris, 1973) , there was no clear accumulation of cells on the stiff side over a prolonged period of time. On the other hand, the ability of cells to interact mechanically across long distances of flexible substrates may represent an effective means of communication in vivo and may explain the striking merging movement when two The values in this table are mean \u03ee standard deviation.

The aim of this study was thus to test the hypothesis that core members of the mammalian Hippo pathway are expressed in skeletal muscle and that the transcriptional co-factor Yap, a core member of the Hippo pathway, regulates C2C12 myogenesis. We found that the major components of the mammalian Hippo pathway including Yap are all expressed in skeletal muscles, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. In C2C12 myoblasts, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low and Yap localises to nuclei. Upon differentiation, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increases approximately 20-fold and Yap translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol. To test whether the observed increase of Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is required for differentiation we overexpressed hYAP1 S127A, a mutant that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127, in C2C12 myoblasts. We found that overexpression of hYAP S127A prevented myotube formation, whereas the overexpression of wildtype hYAP1 or empty vector had no effect. In addition, more hYAP1 S127A overexpressing cells progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle and the expression of MRFs (myogenin, Myf5), Mef2c and cell cycle regulators (p21, cyclin D1) was significantly changed when compared to wildtype hYAP1 and empty vector overexpressing cells. This data suggests that the phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 leads to a changed expression of MRFs and cell cycle regulators and is required for C2C12 myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nWe first monitored the localisation and phosphorylation of Yap at Ser127 during myogenesis for which we used the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line as an in vitro model (Fig.  2 ). During C2C12 myogenesis, myoblasts first proliferate to confluency, withdraw from the cell cycle and then differentiate into myotubes upon a shift to differentiation medium containing lower concentrations of mitogens. We found that Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low in myoblasts but after 24 h in differentiation medium Ser127 phosphorylation is %20-fold increased and after 96 h it is %28-fold higher than in myoblasts, respectively (Fig.  2A , see also Fig.  S1a  in the Supplementary data for a quantification). Changes in the phosphorylation of Yap during differentiation are accompanied by the gradual translocation of Yap from distinct loci in the nucleus of myoblasts to the cytoplasm of myotubes (Fig.  2B ; see Fig.  S2b  in the Supplementary data for additional images).\n\nExcerpt 2: \nAs Yap has previously been reported to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation of neural  [16]  and intestine progenitors  [15]  we decided to study Yap during C2C12 myogenesis in order to test whether it had a similar function in skeletal muscle. At the onset of C2C12 differentiation Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increased %20-fold and Yap increasingly translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol (Fig.  2 ). The likely mechanism is that the Yap Ser127 residue is phosphorylated by Lats1/2  [10, 14, 19]  and that Ser127 phosphorylated Yap is then sequestered by 14-3-3 binding proteins in the cytosol  [11] [12] [13] . Our data suggest that Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is an essential differentiation event because the overexpression of a hYAP1 S127A mutant, which can not be phosphorylated at residue 127, prevents myotube formation and the expression of late differentiation markers (Fig.  3  and Fig.  S2  in Supplementary data).\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn contrast, if hYAP1 S127A is overexpressed cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation are inhibited. To summarise, all of the identified members of the core mammalian Hippo pathway are expressed in skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo. Yap is unphosphorylated and localises to the nucleus in C2C12 myoblasts. At the onset of differentiation Yap becomes phosphorylated at Ser127 and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Ser127 phosphorylation is required for terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells because if the concentration of Yap that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127 is increased by overexpressing a hYAP1 S127A mutant then myoblasts withdraw less from the cell cycle and do not differentiate into myotubes (see Fig.  S4  for a schematic drawing).

To identify genes governing endolysosomal dynamics, we conducted a global fluorescence-based screen to reveal endomembrane effector genes. Screening implicated Phox (PX) domain\u2013containing protein Mdm1 in endomembrane dynamics. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that Mdm1 is a novel interorganelle tethering protein that localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013vacuole/lysosome membrane contact sites (MCSs). We show that Mdm1 is ER anchored and contacts the vacuole surface in trans via its lipid-binding PX domain. Strikingly, overexpression of Mdm1 induced ER\u2013vacuole hypertethering, underscoring its role as an interorganelle tether. We also show that Mdm1 and its paralogue Ydr179w-a (named Nvj3 in this study) localize to ER\u2013vacuole MCSs independently of established tether Nvj1. Finally, we find that Mdm1 truncations analogous to neurological disease\u2013associated SNX14 alleles fail to tether the ER and vacuole and perturb sphingolipid metabolism. Our work suggests that human Mdm1 homologues may play previously unappreciated roles in interorganelle communication and lipid metabolism. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIn addition to mitochondria, the ER also forms MCSs with endosomes and lysosomes (vacuoles in yeast;  Pan et al., 2000; Eden et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2013; Rowland et al., 2014) . Indeed, EM studies showed that the ER and endosomes are closely juxtaposed, allowing the ER-resident phosphatase PTP1B to regulate the sorting of EGF receptors at late endosomes in trans  (Eden et al., 2010) . Additionally, the endosomal sterol-binding protein STARD3 has recently been proposed to bind in trans to ER-localized vesicle-associated proteins, thereby localizing sterol transfer to ER-endosome MCSs  (Alpy et al., 2013) . However, the machinery that establishes ER-en-Although endolysosomal trafficking is well defined, how it is regulated and coordinates with cellular metabolism is unclear. To identify genes governing endolysosomal dynamics, we conducted a global fluorescence-based screen to reveal endomembrane effector genes. Screening implicated Phox (PX) domain-containing protein Mdm1 in endomembrane dynamics.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThe identification of a highly conserved family of ER-endolysosomal tethering proteins in yeast opens the door for further mechanistic work characterizing the roles of ERendosome/lysosome MCSs in endomembrane trafficking, lipid metabolism, and potentially, human neurological disease.\n\nResults and discussion\n\n\nA global membrane trafficking screen implicates PX domain-containing protein Mdm1 in endolysosomal dynamics\nTo uncover novel endolysosomal effector genes, we developed a fluorescence screen based on using the well characterized endocytic cargo Mup1  (Lin et al., 2008; Prosser et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2012; Buchkovich et al., 2013) . Mup1 is the yeast methionine permease and localizes to the PM in yeast cultured without methionine. Upon methionine addition, Mup1 is ubiquitinated and sorted to the vacuolar lumen in an Art1 adaptor-dependent manner  (Lin et al., 2008) . To monitor Mup1 sorting, we conjugated it to the pH-sensitive GFP variant, pHluorin (Mup1-pH).\n\nExcerpt 3: \n4, C-G ). As Nvj1 and Vac8 have no clear homologues in metazoans, Mdm1 family proteins may constitute the first ER-endolysosomal tethers with clear homologues from yeast to man. Given that interorganelle MCSs are implicated in lipid homeostasis, we speculate that the disease-associated Snx14 alleles may perturb ER-endolysosomal interorganelle communication and may additionally perturb aspects of lipid and/or sphingolipid metabolism, contributing to neurological disease. In yeast, the PXA domain is the only domain shared between Mdm1 and Nvj3 and is unique to these proteins, making it specifically localized to ER-vacuole MCSs. This, combined with the observation that an ER-anchored PXA domain is sufficient to induce myriocin hypersensitivity when overexpressed, suggests PXA domains may play a direct role in lipid metabolism through interacting with lipids or ER metabolic proteins. Further studies are needed to reveal the functions of PXA domain-containing proteins in interorganelle communication and lipid metabolism.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

During reperfusion after filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion, ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels increased in ischemic mouse brain. Ischemic injury decreased after intracerebroventricular injections of ICE-like protease inhibitors, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.FMK), acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone, or a relatively selective inhibitor of CPP32-like caspases, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, but not a cathepsin B inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone. z-VAD.FMK decreased ICE-like cleavage products and tissue immunoreactive IL-1\u03b2 levels in ischemic mouse brain and reduced tissue damage when administered to rats as well. Only z-VAD.FMK and acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone reduced brain swelling, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone did not attenuate the ischemia-induced increase in tissue IL-1\u03b2 levels. The three cysteine protease inhibitors significantly improved behavioral deficits, thereby showing that functional recovery of ischemic neuronal tissue can follow blockade of enzymes associated with apoptotic cell death. Finally, we examined the effect of z-VAD.FMK on excitotoxicity and found that it protected against \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-induced or to a lesser extent N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced excitotoxic brain damage. Thus, ICE-like and CPP32-like caspases contribute to mechanisms of cell death in ischemic and excitotoxic brain injury and provide therapeutic targets for stroke and neurodegenerative brain damage. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \n15 min before ischemia and 10 min after reperfusion in 2 equal doses (4 l per dose; 1.5 mm lateral, 0.8 mm posterior from bregma, 4.0 mm below bone surface). Neurological Deficit. Mice and rats were tested for neurological deficits and scored as described by Bederson et al.  (41)  with the following minor modification: 0, no observable neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to extend right forepaw (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side (moderate); 3, loss of walking or righting reflex (severe). The rater was naive to the treatment group, and assessments were made at 10 min and 2 hr during ischemia, and again 18 hr after reperfusion. Western Blot Analysis.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nEighteen hours after reperfusion, the forebrains were divided into five coronal (2-mm) sections using a mouse brain matrix (RBM-2000C; Activational Systems, Warren, MI), and the sections were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma). The infarcted areas were quantitated by an image-analysis system (Bioquant IV; R & M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) and calculated by summing the volumes of each section determined directly  (39)  or indirectly by the following formula: contralateral hemisphere (mm 3 ) \u03ea ipsilateral undamaged volume (mm 3 ; ref. 40). Although statistical significance was achieved by both methods of analysis, only data from the direct method are presented. Brain swelling was calculated according to the following formula: [(infarct volume \u03e9 ipsilateral undamaged volume \u03ea contralateral volume) \u03eb 100\u035econtralateral volume (%)]. For histological evaluation of neuronal damage at 18 hr and 3 days after ischemia, sections (12 m) were stained with hematoxylin\u035eeosin.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nNeurological deficits were significantly reduced after 18 hr but not immediately upon reperfusion. The neurological score was somewhat better after the injection of 240 ng rather than 80 ng, although the differences were not statistically significant. Neuroprotection sustained for at least 3 days [152 \u03ee 5 (n \u03ed 4) vs. 75 \u03ee 30 mm 3 (n \u03ed 5) for vehicle-treated and z-VAD.FMKtreated (80 ng) groups, respectively]. Some of the damage at 18 hr and 3 days was attributed to brain swelling which was detected in the control group. z-VAD.FMK significantly decreased brain swelling at 18 hr [12.9 \u03ee 2.7% (n \u03ed 12) vs. 2.9 \u03ee 1.4% (n \u03ed 8) for vehicle and z-VAD.FMK, respectively] and 3 days as well. To determine if more specific inhibitors of the ICE family may also reduce ischemic brain injury, we examined whether YVAD.CMK, which is specific for the ICE-like caspases, can also reduce ischemic injury in our model.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or non-subcellular resolution. It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCR is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins, or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein activation, or that internalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response. Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternate interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCR are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR, and its cognate G protein, Gs in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \ninternalized GPCR can indeed contribute to the acute G protein-mediated response \n10  . Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternate interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCR are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR  11  , and its cognate G protein, G s (ref. 12) in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane; and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nThus, while it remains clear that \u03b2 2 -ARs can elicit G s -mediated signal transduction from the plasma membrane, the present data reveal a discrete component of the acute signalling response that is initiated from endosomes (Fig.  4g ). It remains unknown if \u03b2 2 -ARs are continuously bound by agonist in endosomes, as depicted in the figure for simplicity, but conformational activation of G s in endosomes is both receptor and agonist-dependent. Unambiguous detection of endosome-based activation of acute G-protein-linked signalling is presently limited to the \u03b2 2 -AR G s system for which the critical nanobodies are available. However, we believe that endosome-based contribution to the acute signalling response is likely widespread in the GPCR superfamily because the \u03b2 2 -AR belongs to the largest group (family A) of GPCR and is often considered a prototype. We also suggest, more generally, that nanobody-based biosensors represent a versatile strategy for probing other types of dynamic conformational change with high spatiotemporal resolution in living cells.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nBecause endosomes contain activated \u03b2 2 -ARs, we next asked if receptors engage their cognate G protein from this compartment. Heterotrimeric G proteins and adenylyl cyclase can be observed in endosomes as well as at the plasma membrane, supporting the concept of endosome-based G protein signalling  4, 6, 10, 24  . To directly investigate the subcellular location of G protein activation, we developed a distinct biosensor based on another nanobody, Nb37, which specifically recognizes the guanine-nucleotide-free form of G\u03b1 s representing the catalytic intermediate of G protein activation (Fig.  4a )  25  . We hoped that because Nb37 binds a surface of the alpha-helical domain that is accessible only in the nucleotide-free form, we would be able to detect production of this critical but fleeting activation intermediate in living cells. This was indeed the case because Nb37-GFP localized in the cytoplasm of untreated cells and was rapidly recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to isoprenaline application (Fig.  4b , yellow arrowhead, Pearson coefficient = 0.627).\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

BBB compromise has been found in many pathological conditions, including neuroinflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), a chemokine that is transiently and significantly up-regulated during inflammation, is able to disrupt the integrity of BBB and modulate the progression of various diseases, including excitotoxic injury and hemorrhage. In this review, we first introduce the biochemistry and biology of MCP1, and then summarize the effects of MCP1 on BBB integrity as well as individual BBB components. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nConsistent with our report, tPA, which converts inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, has been found to promote BBB disruption and subsequent peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) infiltration  [73] . Additionally, BBB compromise and PBMC infiltration have also been found in mice deficient for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1  [74] , suggesting that the effect of MCP1 on BBB is dependent on plasmin activity. MCP1, however, failed to compromise BBB integrity in CCR2 -/-mice  [67] , suggesting that the effect of MCP1 on BBB also depends on CCR2. The next question then becomes how exactly MCP1-CCR2 axis affects the integrity of BBB. The roles of MCP1-CCR2 on individual BBB components are summarized below.\n\nBMeCs\nThe capillary endothelium in the brain is 50-100 times tighter than that in the periphery  [75] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nPerturbation of BBB has been found in many neurological conditions, including trauma  [50, 51] , brain tumors  [52, 53] , stroke  [54] [55] [56] , and neurodegenerative diseases  [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] , and BBB breakdown is one of the hallmarks that accompany the progression of these diseases. Recently, BBB compromise has been found to play a causative role in the onset of Alzheimer's disease  [57]  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  [62] . A large number of molecules have been reported to affect the permeability of BBB, such as MCP1, TNF-\u03b1, . Here, we focus on the effect of MCP1 on BBB integrity. It has been shown that injection of recombinant mouse MCP1 into the brain disrupts BBB integrity  [65-67, 71, 72] . we have previously been able to further demonstrate that plasmin-mediated truncation of MCP1 is indispensable for MCP1-induced BBB compromise  [71] .\n\nExcerpt 3: \nIn addition, ZO-1 has been detected in the nucleus and shown to co-localize with transcription factors in some conditions  [106] [107] [108] [109] , suggesting its potential role as a signaling molecule. BMeCs as the major barrier of BBB have been under extensive investigations. Accumulating evidence shows that MCP1 compromises BBB integrity via redistribution of tight junction proteins from cell-cell border (probable via endocytosis) and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in BMeCs  [65] [66] [67] 72] . we have previously been able to verify these data and further show that these changes are dependent on plasmin activity  [71] . Mechanistic studies reveal that phosphorylation of TJP regulates their functions and locations  [95, 96, [110] [111] [112] . Stamatovic and colleagues further demonstrated that the binding of MCP1 to CCR2 activated PKC (specifically PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b6) and Rho kinase, resulting in shift of tight junction proteins from cell border to intracellular compartments  [65, 66] .\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

We observe that the crystallization time and thin film structure are strongly influenced by the chemical nature and porosity of the substrate. Moreover, we find that the mesoporous scaffold can tune the emissive properties of the semiconducting compound both in terms of spectral region and dynamics. In particular, perovskite crystallites grown in the nanometre size porous scaffold present a shorter-living and blue-shifted emission with respect to the perovskite crystals which are free to grow without any constraints. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nAs a further evolution, thin film architectures have been particularly successful  6, 11, 12  demonstrating performances comparable to traditional inorganic thin-film solar cells.  13, 14  While we have borne witness to unbelievable progress and evolution of photovoltaic devices based on these materials, the huge gap in understanding when moving from the pristine molecules to their embodiment in a device can severely hamper their widespread adoption in optoelectronic applications. From the literature it is clear that every preliminary test of these materials in device architectures has revealed exciting surprises, however their working mechanisms remain remarkably obscure. Our poor understanding of the relationship between structure and optoelectronic properties is a key shortcoming, especially given that hybrid perovskites are intrinsically complex materials, where the presence of various types of interactions and structural disorder may play an important role in the material properties. The difficulty in predicting the response of these materials to the interaction with external stimuli makes it impossible to frame them as a proper technology.

Thus, the absence of dystrophin may lead to the loss of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, and the reduction in this glycoprotein may be one of the first stages of the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.\nDuCHENNE muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene located on the X chromosome.

Therefore, to understand the molecular pathogenesis of DMD, we sought to identify the proteins associated with or bound to dystrophin and to characterize the status of these proteins in muscle where dystrophin is absent.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nFor example, muscle from mdx mice shows elevated intracellular ionized Ca 2 + levels and corresponding higher net degradation of muscle proteins  20  \u2022 Loss of a dystrophin-anchored protein with a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium could result in elevated intracellular calcium levels and lead to the reported activation of calciumdependent protease activities  21  \u2022 Such a mechanism could explain the abnormal muscle protein degradation and fibre necrosis of dystrophic muscle. The absence of dystrophin-associated proteins in dystrophic muscle may complicate the therapeutic efficacy of myoblast transfer  22  , as the reintroduction of dystrophin synthesis might not lead to recovery of associated protein levels and thus could necessitate treatment at only one particular developmental stage. Finally, a deficiency or defect in a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein could perhaps explain the DMD-like symptoms observed in suspected autosomal-recessive patients  23  \u2022 24 that express apparently normal dystrophin.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

Their apparent biocompatibility [2] and chemical inertness make them an ideal candidate for all kinds of biomedical devices. On the other hand, their surface can be functionalised with a variety of groups in order to incorporate them into polymer matrices, surface coatings and the like  [3] . An essential prerequisite for these applications is the control of surface structure and particle size and agglomeration. So far, different approaches for the surface functionalisation and deagglomeration have been taken. Chiganova produced diamond hydrosols from oxidized detonation diamond [4], whereas Xu and coworkers used surface active compounds for the dispersion of nanodiamond particles  [5] . Khabashesku et al. obtained small agglomerates of \u223c160 nm in size by the fluorination of detonation diamond  [6] . These particles formed stable suspensions in THF. Another approach is the mechanical deagglomeration in suspension by stirred media milling  [7]  or beads assisted sonic disintegration  [8] .\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn the latter solvent no sedimentation was observed for a period of one month. The particle size of the agglomerates in the suspensions was reduced from several micron (pristine ND: \u223c 15 \u03bcm, ND-OH: \u223c 6 \u03bcm) to 300-450 nm in the case of ND-OOC-C 3 H 7 (2), 150-260 nm for ND-OOC-C 5 H 11  (3) , \u223c170 nm for ND-OOC-C 12 H 23 (4), and 170-300 nm for ND-OOC-C 18 H 37  (5) . Fig.  3  shows the development of suspensions of pristine detonation diamond and compounds 1-5 in dichloromethane. The stable dispersion of functionalised nanodiamond in organic solvents opens the way to further surface modification in more homogeneous systems leading to better accessibility of the surface groups as well as a more homogeneous distribution of the diamond particles in the medium. Carboxylic groups with terminal surface groups have to be reacted with the diamond surface if further reactions are to be carried out. This work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThis work is under way and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary we have modified the surface of hydroxylated detonation nanodiamond with alkyl chains of different length by an esterification reaction of carboxylic acid chlorides with the surface hydroxyl groups. The resulting materials had a surface loading of 0.3-0.4 mmol g -1 and showed a much better dispersibility in several organic solvents along with a smaller particle size of the remaining agglomerates. This enables the homogeneous incorporation of such materials in non-hydrophilic matrices and further modification in stable suspension. In the future, it will be important to further reduce the agglomerate size by such chemical deagglomeration and stabilization techniques down to the primary particles.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

These methods have begun to unravel key questions in cancer biology that have been difficult to address with bulk tumor measurements. Over the past five years, there has been extraordinary progress in technological developments and research applications, but these efforts represent only the tip of the iceberg. In the coming years, SCS will greatly improve our understanding of invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance during cancer progression. These tools will also have direct translational applications in the clinic, in areas such as early detection, noninvasive monitoring, and guiding targeted therapy. In this perspective, I discuss the progress that has been made and the myriad of unexplored applications that still lie ahead in cancer research and medicine. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nSingle-cell cancer genomics\n\n\nConclusions and future directions\nIn the first five years since its inception, SCS has already revolutionized our understanding of cancer evolution and diversity. Although initial studies focused mainly on technology development and intratumor heterogeneity in primary tumors, the field has now shifted toward understanding more complex biological processes in cancer, including invasion, metastasis, and the evolution of therapy resistance. These tools have also begun to provide new insight into the role of rare cells in tumor progression, particularly in the context of metastatic dissemination. Future studies will begin to unravel the spatial organization of tumor clones in tissues and will connect phenotypic behaviors of cancer cells with their genotypes. This will require combining SCS with multiple experimental systems, including xenografts, GEMs, cell cultures, and organoid systems. As DNA-and RNA-SCS methods continue to mature, their translation into the clinic is inevitable and will have a major impact on patient lives.\n\nExcerpt 2: \nIn diagnostics, intratumor heterogeneity presents a formidable challenge for clinical sampling, because single samples may not accurately represent the tumor as a whole. SCS methods can resolve intratumor heterogeneity and provide accurate measures of genomic diversity, which can be used to calculate a \"diversity index.\" These indexes are likely to have prognostic utility in predicting which cancer patients will be more likely to show poor response to therapy, higher probability of metastasis, or have poor overall survival  (Burrell et al. 2013; Murugaesu et al. 2013; Almendro et al. 2014) . Another important clinical application of SCS methods is to guide targeted therapy. By sequencing and comparing multiple single cells, it is possible to construct a phylogenetic tree and heatmap that reveals the clonal substructure of a tumor. These genetic trees will allow oncologists to identify founder mutations in the \"trunk\" of the tree, which are ideal therapeutic targets, since they occurred early in tumor evolution and were inherited by all cells in the tumor. Alternatively, these trees can be used to devise combination therapies to target multiple tumor subpopulations independently.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nEarly detection is another clinical application of SCS, which can provide genomic information on rare tumor cells. In samples collected from bodily fluids (blood, urine, feces, and phlegm), it may be possible to isolate single cancer cells at the earliest stages of cancer progression. If driver mutations can be identified in multiple single cancer cells, then they may represent a clonal expansion, which could be followed by imaging techniques and surgical resection of microlesions. Another important clinical application of SCS is for obtaining genomic data sets from scarce clinical samples, which often contain only hundreds of tumor cells and are frequently unable to undergo genetic tests due to Quantity Not Sufficient (QNS). Perhaps the most immediate application of SCS in the clinic will be in noninvasive monitoring. By isolating and sequencing single CTCs in the blood, it may be possible to measure somatic mutations that are present at the primary or metastatic tumor sites without the inherent risks that are associated with performing an invasive core biopsy directly at the organ site. Additionally, this noninvasive approach can allow the oncologist to collect serial samples over time during the course of therapy to monitor response and the emergence of resistant clones.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}

A circularly polarized light is completely converted to the cross-polarized light which can either be bent or focused tightly near the diffraction limit. It depends on a precise control of the optical-axis profile of the antennas on a subwavelength scale, in which the rotation angle of the optical axis has a simple linear relationship to the phase discontinuity. Such an approach enables effective wave front engineering within a subwavelength scale. \nExcerpts: \n\nExcerpt 1: \nIf we assume the plane wave is normally incident to the metamaterial surface, the refraction angle is governed by sin ( 2 ) t d dx \u03b1 \u03bb \u03c0 = \u03a6 , where the refractive index in the refracted region is assumed to be vacuum, i.e. 1 t n = . The linear phase variation, i.e. the gradient of the linear phase variation d dx \u03a6 being constant, can bend the incident wave at an angle. According to our scheme for the linear phase variation, the gradient of the phase variation is 2 / G k d dx D \u03c0 =\u03a6 = , where D is the total width of the antennas array and the rotation angle ranges from 0 to \u03c0 .\n\nB: Parabolic phase discontinuity:\nIn fact, the linear phase relationship is only one possibility to manipulate the wave front.\n\nExcerpt 2: \n1 (e) . Taking into account of the linear and parabolic phase discontinuity along the metamaterial surface through an array of split ring aperture antenna with defined profiles of the rotation angles, as depicted in Fig.  1(c ), one representative structure (A) is designed and is composed of 11 rotating antennas to realize the linear phase variation from 0 to 2 \u03c0 . Considering the finite size of the unit cell, the phase variation is not continuous but is discrete. For structure A, each unit cell only needs a discrete rotation with step size of 0.1 \u03c0 to realize the linear phase variation from 0 to 2 \u03c0 . The case of structure B contains 15 rotating resonators with defined rotation angle to realize the parabolic phase variation in Eq. (  4 ). Here, we emphasize that phase variation acquired by rotating optical axis is free of dispersion of the resonator, as we could keep the desired anisotropic behavior. To verify our proposed scheme, we have performed full-wave simulations using CST Microwave Studio, based on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm  [28] . We utilize the perfect conductor approximation (PCA) for simplicity.\n\nExcerpt 3: \nThe transmitted field E t is the obtained by Eq. (1) as 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 1 1 ( ) ( ) 0 1 2 2 j t t t t t e \u03b8 - \uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6 = + + - \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8 E (2) Therefore, if \u03b8 is spatially dependent, we can modulate the wave front for the cross-polarized light (left-handed polarized, the second term) by a spatially dependent phase discontinuity 2 j e \u03b8 -. The acquired phase discontinuity (phase gained by the incident light across the metamaterial) is twice that of the rotation angle of the antennas. This is a simple linear relationship between the phase discontinuity and the phase modulation (rotation angles) over the antennas array. We note that this phase discontinuity is not coming from the (frequency) dispersion by sweeping a series of resonating structure. The phase discontinuity here is geometric in nature and is related to the optical-axis rotation angle by a factor of two.\n\n\n"}], "temperature": 0}}
